education committee looks like we're
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
I know it was hard leaving here at 5 30
 
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
getting to bed around 12 15 getting up
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
at five ish to drive down it's it's a
 
00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 align:start position:0%
very short sleep
 
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
so today on our hearing process here
 
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're starting out uh with HB 627 this
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
is relative to local education
 
00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
Improvement plans and disparities in
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
education representative sure are the
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of that bill
 
00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:14.270 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of that bill
foreign

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
for the last few years
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
excuse me for the last few years we've
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
been saying or I've been saying I would
 
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
like to see accountability on all of
 
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
this money we keep giving more and more
 
00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 align:start position:0%
money to
 
00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:43.189 align:start position:0%
money to
um

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
schools in general
 
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.969 align:start position:0%
schools in general
and

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
there's no we don't know what it's being
 
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 align:start position:0%
used for we don't we you know we get the
 
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
assessment at the end but that's it and
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
I've been saying can't we put something
 
00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
on there well last year
 
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
in the um
 
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.129 align:start position:0%
in the um
Foundation

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
Foundation
 
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
whatever the book
 
00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 align:start position:0%
education funding plan there was
 
00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.350 align:start position:0%
education funding plan there was
accountability

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it was supposedly just for schools
 
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
that are what we would call failing
 
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
right but I said as far as I'm concerned
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
every school
 
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
could improve I mean when our average
 
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
State proficiency is less than 50 in
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
both reading and math and like 27 in
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
math as far as I'm concerned every
 
00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.650 align:start position:0%
math as far as I'm concerned every
school

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
could use Improvement so I basically
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
lifted the words straight out of that
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
changed a few not much mostly to make it
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
a standalone and that's what I am
 
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.490 align:start position:0%
a standalone and that's what I am
introducing

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure where to put it
 
00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
rsa193h is actually a very appropriate
 
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
place to put it but they took the first
 
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.090 align:start position:0%
place to put it but they took the first
section

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
and repealed
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh four
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
and put it there and that's not really
 
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
what I wanted
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
but this bill I didn't even get it until
 
00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
December 23rd and I thought I'm not
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
going to try and revamp it in that short
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
amount of time you know we were up on
 
00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139 align:start position:0%
the deadline then
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
I figured you guys would have more
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
things you might want to amend anyways I
 
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
just amend it once we had this and I got
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
everybody's feedback
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
but what I would like because I like the
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
wording that's there in four now and
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's for basically what we would what
 
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.129 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
and I like that what I would like to do
 
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
is put all of this after that section
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
because my intent is this for to be
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
every school not just those schools that
 
00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:06.070 align:start position:0%
every school not just those schools that
are

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
basically failing schools
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
I would like it to go for all of them
 
00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.850 align:start position:0%
I would like it to go for all of them
um

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
so the first part
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
says each public school I think I put
 
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
every public school but at any rate
 
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.309 align:start position:0%
every public school but at any rate
um

00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
shall have until July 1st 2024 so that
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
gives them a year from the time this
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
actually will be enacted to come up with
 
00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:35.459 align:start position:0%
an improvement plan it was called a
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
turnaround named it an improvement
 
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
everybody can improve not everybody
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
needs to turn around but everybody can
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
improve so I I called it an improvement
 
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
plan and it's basically to get every
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
school to look at
 
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
what are some issues what are some
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
things we found where we need
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
Improvement you know they can look at
 
00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:00.019 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
results that come back from the
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessments and say you know
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
we our math scores are really low or it
 
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
looks like kids you know are have
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
struggling with this or that part of it
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
or the same thing so
 
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
that's to encourage them to come up with
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
a plan
 
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.370 align:start position:0%
a plan
and

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
after talking with all of the rest of
 
00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:29.150 align:start position:0%
after talking with all of the rest of
the

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:33.019 align:start position:0%
the parents the teachers the community
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
the industries and see what they're
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
needing and what you know how the school
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
could improve to meet those needs for
 
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.710 align:start position:0%
could improve to meet those needs for
employment

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to peek at a few things
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know steps to improve or expand
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
child welfare services and has
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
appropriate law enforcement
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
they may not need that but they may have
 
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
a few kids who could use that right and
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
so it's just making sure that the
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
families and the kids know what's
 
00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:07.019 align:start position:0%
available it's not to say the school has
 
00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
to do this or push this but make sure
 
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
they they understand and communicate
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
what's available for various parents
 
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:16.900 align:start position:0%
kids whatever
 
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:17.269 align:start position:0%
kids whatever
[Music]

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:19.509 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
let's see most of the things are pretty
 
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.410 align:start position:0%
let's see most of the things are pretty
clear

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
and even assessment it's not one
 
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
particular assessment it's multiple
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
measures of school performance and
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
school Success student attendance you
 
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
know all of that safety if you got kids
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
fighting in the Halls all the time or
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
being rude to the teachers or whatever
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
you need Improvement right you need to
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
be looking at what can we do can we
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
change this culture in the school
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know what can we do that's going to
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
help the culture and help
 
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.069 align:start position:0%
help the culture and help
um

00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
try to make a culture of learning and
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
support of each other
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
as opposed to fighting and and arguing
 
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.590 align:start position:0%
as opposed to fighting and and arguing
and

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
so that can be an area and that can make
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
a huge difference in how students do if
 
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
they're actually looking forward to it
 
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.100 align:start position:0%
or dreading it
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
parent and family engagement that's
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
something that I think has gone by the
 
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:29.660 align:start position:0%
wayside in in some school districts
 
00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:32.339 align:start position:0%
that parents are no longer there and
 
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
involved and
 
00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
according to um
 
00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:38.990 align:start position:0%
according to um
scls

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
scls
 
00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:41.459 align:start position:0%
any of the social emotional any of the
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
studies with that basically it's been
 
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
determined that the number one
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
ingredient to being successful in any of
 
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:54.740 align:start position:0%
those areas are having the parents
 
00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
intimately involved getting those ideas
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
into the parents and then ultimately
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
into the community and a culture of
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
working together of helping each other
 
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:08.660 align:start position:0%
of being nice you know that
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
take a breath deep breath before you
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
respond all of those things can be
 
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.050 align:start position:0%
respond all of those things can be
helpful

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
but you need to get the parents you need
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
to get the community involved and so
 
00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
there's a step of that parent and family
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
engagement building a culture of
 
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
academic success where ah you're just a
 
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
nerd and you know whatever and kids are
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
afraid if they do well to even let
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
anybody know to yay congratulations good
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
job and that's that's a culture and I
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
think a lot of that is dependent upon
 
00:12:46.449 --> 00:12:46.459 align:start position:0%
the principle as I think our wonderful
 
00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
illustrious chairman will agree the
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
principal does a lot to set the mood and
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
and then the second sect so they have
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
they will have a year to come up with an
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
improvement plan and then beyond that
 
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
every three years they're going to come
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
up with a new
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
with an ongoing plan
 
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
with an ongoing plan
um

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
if they're going to evaluate it every
 
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
year and that's for okay we've put in
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
our Improvement plan we've worked it out
 
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
some and we're still seeing this
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
population or this population whatever
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
is just not doing as well and and we
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
can't we we can't predict what a
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
particular school's what population is
 
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
is not going to be doing well you know
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
because every school is different every
 
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:42.860 align:start position:0%
population is different
 
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
so they will look and say well you know
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
this worked for these kids but it didn't
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
work for these kids so what can we do
 
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
how can we change it how are we going to
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
reach out for these kids
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
and so that plan is in some ways a
 
00:13:59.650 --> 00:13:59.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
detailed but at the same time they had
 
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
more time to get to that plan and in
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
that we're involving the um
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education the doe as
 
00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:13.250 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education the doe as
well

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
because we will have had time for them
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
to start to come out with okay what do
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
we see Statewide what do we see in
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
general populations that are are
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
not just not improving and
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
setting some goals
 
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
and um so that's
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:14:41.329 --> 00:14:41.339 align:start position:0%
I'm not expecting that the schools are
 
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
provide like it's a social services to
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
support students social emotional and
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
physical health that doesn't mean the
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
school has to hire somebody it means
 
00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:56.339 align:start position:0%
that they need to know what's available
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
and what's in the community
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
and you know what what's there in
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
existence already that they can be
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
better utilizing
 
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.889 align:start position:0%
better utilizing
um

00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
exp it says expanding Early Education
 
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
and pre-kindergarten program within the
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
district and consultation or in
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
partnership with community-based
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
organizations and that again doesn't
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
mean that the school has to agree for
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
writing or the town has free for writing
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
that's why it says
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
in partnership with and I'm thinking one
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
of those I was thinking of
 
00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:28.910 align:start position:0%
of those I was thinking of
um

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
English language learners
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
if you have as exist in some cities or
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
towns a church group that has decided
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be the welcoming
 
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
group for people coming in from this
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
country you know a particular place and
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
maybe bringing them in they may have
 
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:51.260 align:start position:0%
already set up an English language
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
learning you know teaching the adults
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
and during that time those adults have
 
00:15:59.569 --> 00:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
kids so they may well have like a play
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
grouper or whatever where they can be
 
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:04.940 align:start position:0%
again working in English
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
reading the little stories with the
 
00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:10.519 align:start position:0%
picture books in English to try to start
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
getting those kids ready and used to
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
English so it won't be so hard when they
 
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
get to school so it's not necessarily
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
something that the school has to fund or
 
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.470 align:start position:0%
something that the school has to fund or
do

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
but they need to see what's in existence
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
and make those connections and see what
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
they can do to encourage maybe they'll
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
send a teacher or so over there as a
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
volunteer on a Saturday to read and play
 
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
with the kids you know but getting them
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.339 --> 00:16:43.569 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:43.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
diversifying the educator and
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
administrator Workforce diversifying
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
diversity comes in all kinds of flavors
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
and colors and it may just mean
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
that instead of all of your teachers
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
having come straight from the schools
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know went to school went to college
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
came and teached that instead some
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
percentage of our teachers are going to
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
be coming from the workforce are going
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
to have done the workforce and then
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
decided they wanted to teach and get
 
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
their certification and teach so you
 
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
have a diversity of experiences A
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
diversity of backgrounds
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
so that that there's a lot there to
 
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.829 align:start position:0%
so that that there's a lot there to
offer

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
offer
 
00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:26.150 align:start position:0%
offer
um

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
and at any rate I'm assuming that you
 
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
guys can read and read this but those
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
were just some things I wanted to
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
highlight so I'm ready for questions
 
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative I I
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
do have one question for you
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh obviously that the the sectional law
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
within this chapter uh you're you're
 
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
dealing with 193h colon four well that's
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
where they put it but it is is directly
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
related to the preceding sections in
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
this chapter where we're talking about
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive support and Improvement
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
plans for the lowest five percent we're
 
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
talking about the targeted support for
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
those that have significant difference
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
between subgroups uh and it's also part
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
of our waiver for the Federal grant we
 
00:18:17.049 --> 00:18:17.059 align:start position:0%
call it Essa right and this portion here
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it part of that is also related in
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
193 H4 in terms of how we address the
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
Improvement plans for these these
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
programs which are required by federal
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
law right by changing uh what you have
 
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
here are you uh then also saying to the
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
department that we're going to have to
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
change the nature of our waiver for the
 
00:18:41.529 --> 00:18:41.539 align:start position:0%
S no no
 
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
as I said I didn't know where this I
 
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
gave OLS the piece of what I wanted in
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
for all schools
 
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
and they put it here I didn't know where
 
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
to put it and I don't think that's where
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
it goes
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
but I don't know where it goes and so
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
that's part of what I want to do is
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
amend where it goes and so I'm looking
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
to wiser heads
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
to to figure out where this should
 
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
actually go if I want all schools to be
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
doing this not just the lowest five
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
percent where does this need to go and
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
so that's as I said I would like to make
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment when we're done with all of
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
this that correct fixes any of those
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
things and that's the first one I knew
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
right off the bat needed to be fixed I
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
don't know what to fix it to but I'm
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
hoping you will give me some good
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
suggestions well just enough up would
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
you think then that in order to do that
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
so we don't
 
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
run the risk uh of changing something
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
that's been approved uh federally right
 
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:46.580 align:start position:0%
now and we're talking
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I agree it we absolutely that is
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
not where this goes would it not be
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
right that it not be done just by this
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
committee but it also be done through
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education too
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely this language is originally
 
00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:04.940 align:start position:0%
written I I believe that was Heather um
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
Gates and myself sat down and did this
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
and we just look at these guidelines
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
over here regulations and we looked at
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
this and saying this is what we need to
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
change to be in line alignment with
 
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
those right and I and that's why when
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
they said when this came out and it said
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
it was going to be repealed and I'm like
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
I don't want that repealed that's really
 
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
good it needs to stay so I have to
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
repeal it right and and that's fine and
 
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:33.539 align:start position:0%
that's why I said this needs to go
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
somewhere but where do we put it so
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you further
 
00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:38.299 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question I mean this is a
 
00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
massive uh change here that you're
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
proposing so could you just summarize
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill the intent of the bill
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
is for schools to be
 
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.010 align:start position:0%
is for schools to be
um

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
to be accountable to all of the money
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
which we give them by coming up with a
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
plan of how they're going to use it how
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
they're going to use the extra like the
 
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
things that we give for
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
um the free and reduced lunch population
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
the things we give for the English
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
language learner population
 
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
Etc instead of just here's the money
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
have at it what's your plan how are you
 
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
going to use this how are you going to
 
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:27.539 align:start position:0%
improve how your school is doing because
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
I think we can all agree that schools
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
need to improve
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
from where they are for other questions
 
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:39.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative a hall
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes now I gotta go to the page thank
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question thank you Mr
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
chair uh you mentioned when you were
 
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
talking about diverse diversifying the
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
the workforce you mentioned experience
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
background I also see you have political
 
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
points of view
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
can you speak to that I can I think it's
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
important not to have all just one voice
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
I think having multiple voices and and
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
different points of view doesn't
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean Republicans and
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
Democrats it can mean Libertarians it
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
can mean green party it could mean
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
whatever but a diversity of points of
 
00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:13.310 align:start position:0%
whatever but a diversity of points of
view

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:15.419 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:18.539 align:start position:0%
um well hopefully certainly when I went
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
to school nobody knew where our teachers
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
stood on any of these things because
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
they'd lost their jobs if we did so
 
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
teachers weren't allowed to do that but
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
these days it seems that it's a
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
different environment and teachers are
 
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:32.990 align:start position:0%
different environment and teachers are
free

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
to give their opinions
 
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
and it's so let kids have hear multiple
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
opinions that's all okay
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
let's go okay around with one question
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
piece right now representative Ellison
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then represent Belcher uh thank you
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I I have about 25 questions I
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
doubt that the chair will allow me to
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
ask the wallet uh following up on on
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative Halls this is just this
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
is the tiny little follow-up but not my
 
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
real question but this goes back to the
 
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
political point of view if I'm a
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
principal and I'm a hiring you know two
 
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
English teachers
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
how do I determine what their political
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
point of view is and what kind of
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
questions do I ask them hopefully you
 
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.549 align:start position:0%
questions do I ask them hopefully you
can't

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
and I will take that out of there as
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
long as we
 
00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:24.059 align:start position:0%
I will change that wording as long as we
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
understand that what we're looking for
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
is a diversity of points of view okay
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
thank you my real question was a real
 
00:23:32.039 --> 00:23:33.190 align:start position:0%
thank you my real question was a real
question

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
represent Hall is going to be all over
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
you in a minute this is a quick one this
 
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
is a quick one uh on on page three and
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
line three and then again on line 18 you
 
00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:52.100 align:start position:0%
reference evidence-based
 
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.430 align:start position:0%
reference evidence-based
programs

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh line 18 seems to imply that the
 
00:24:00.649 --> 00:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
commissioner that determines that but I
 
00:24:03.289 --> 00:24:03.299 align:start position:0%
guess my question is who determines what
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
an evidence-based program is is that the
 
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
Commissioners at the superintendo
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
schools the school board is it the local
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
community who makes that determination
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.370 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean that's why you're
 
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
that's why you're going to all of these
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
people somebody can come in and say and
 
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
present I mean we evidence-based means
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
that they have there's been studies
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
there's evidence of improvement Etc but
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
not everybody knows what all of those
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
things are so you may have somebody from
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
the community say hey there's this
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
program and here's all the evidence and
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
it worked really well or you may have
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner say where I'm aware of
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
these things the idea is you're reaching
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
out to all of these groups to get ideas
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
and not just staying in your own little
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is what we know if you're going to
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
improve you want to take in lots of
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
different ideas and choose amongst them
 
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419 align:start position:0%
so you do some research if you're trying
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
to choose between A and B you know
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
but evidence-based there should be there
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
should be data
 
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
out there supporting those or how can
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
they be evidence-based thank you
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you replicas
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
for let rep lack us for this
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
um so I think the point of the bill is
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
is to create a mandate that schools
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
improve while also providing somewhat of
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
a free hand
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
um but I'm a little concerned about
 
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
where we're providing a free hand in
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
this looking at the bottom half of page
 
00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
one there's
 
00:25:42.659 --> 00:25:43.690 align:start position:0%
one there's
um

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:43.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
superintendent Improvement plan sorry a
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
line 16 going down talks about things
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
like the implementation of mental health
 
00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:54.299 align:start position:0%
screening and care
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
in schools as well as improving welfare
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
services and law enforcement services in
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
schools so is the intent of the bill to
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
provide a free hand to schools in those
 
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
Arenas as well as the academic realm
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have particular
 
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
students who need outside help and so
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's important that they know what that
 
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:24.020 align:start position:0%
help is and so part of that I expect
 
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:27.980 align:start position:0%
there to be some way for that to be
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
noticed communicated Etc not that the
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
school has to be doing it but the school
 
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
needs to be familiar with it so they can
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
hand off so to speak this child
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know to this person who can evaluate
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
to this person who can deal with them so
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's not no the school doing all of this
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
but as part of the Improvement they need
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
to know who those Community people are
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
how do we hand that off that's part of
 
00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:00.049 align:start position:0%
how do we hand that off that's part of
the

00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:00.059 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:00.649 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
you have the general population and then
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
you have Stu some students who who what
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing generally isn't working for
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
them and so we have those
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
um connections
 
00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:22.490 align:start position:0%
um connections
representative

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
so I'll make the statement that I try to
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
make about 20 or 30 times a session and
 
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
that is that public schools are over
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
regulated and underfunded and that's the
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
basic problem that we should be
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
addressing not all this other stuff but
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know
 
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.289 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know
um

00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
if this is based on model legislation
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
and if it applies since it's each public
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
school does it apply to Charter Schools
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
and if not why not thank you
 
00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:54.419 align:start position:0%
so it is based on I don't know if you'd
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
say model legislation the bill that we
 
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
had last year to enact
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
whatever that's
 
00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
the booklet that we got
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
no it helped me out rep Miler is uh 709
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
it's yes the
 
00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:18.059 align:start position:0%
the one that's sitting on some of your
 
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:21.860 align:start position:0%
tables right now the foundation
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll get into that in a little bit
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
here that's my next question for you I
 
00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
was going to yeah
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
we had a law that we had a bill put
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
forward by the Democrats and I think
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
particularly uh rep luno and Rhett miler
 
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
that had almost word for word what I
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
have here I said I changed a few small
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
words there was one paragraph
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
I couldn't parse because it was a large
 
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
run-on dependent clause and I divided it
 
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
up into individual sentences best I
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
could meaning the same thing
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
and there were a few things that
 
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
referred to the plan that I had to take
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
out but almost word from word from that
 
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
bill from last year so that's what this
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
is based on it is almost entirely what
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
was in that bill that we had last year
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
and we were told and this bill has
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
accountability and I said woohoo I would
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
love to see some accountability and so I
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
figured if I used what was in there then
 
00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
there would be less objection
 
00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:28.370 align:start position:0%
there would be less objection
okay

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
what oh and the charter schools
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
I was leaving I
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
I was leaving that up to
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think I had said every school and I
 
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
was kind of leaving that up to this
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
committee to decide whether we wanted to
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
do and Charter Schools or not I don't
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
have a problem with it Jefferson cascad
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you um for my
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
questions for answering my questions I
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
want a couple clarifying points first
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
before I can ask and make sure it
 
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
applies my first comment is in hiring to
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
staff administrators are bound by Title
 
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
IX non-discrimination and certainly risk
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
managements there are questions you can
 
00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:12.539 align:start position:0%
not ask I don't care if I like the
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
sweater or don't like the sweater right
 
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean it's we are very
 
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
guarded and we have specific areas that
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
we we can ask going back to page one
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
um the section that representative
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Belcher had
 
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.810 align:start position:0%
Belcher had
mentioned

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
comparing it to the law in the book if
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'm in the right place and I'm not sure
 
00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
from the law because I I'm looking at
 
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.669 align:start position:0%
from the law because I I'm looking at
193

00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
193
 
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
-h colon four as I said
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
this is not where I think this bill
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
belongs this is where OLS put it I got
 
00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
they didn't even come out with it until
 
00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
almost the end of December 23rd
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
I decided rather than trying to
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
do that in the few days that we had
 
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
around Christmas that would be something
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
we as a committee could decide I don't
 
00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
think that's the right place and I do
 
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
not want to repeal and replace HB 193. I
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
think that would be the wrong thing to
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
do okay so my question actually pertains
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
to that if I may
 
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.769 align:start position:0%
to that if I may
um

00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
so what this says is that a
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
superintendent might take great pride in
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
that good
 
00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:28.130 align:start position:0%
that good
um

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be responsible for
 
00:31:32.889 --> 00:31:32.899 align:start position:0%
addressing Social Services Health needs
 
00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
School nurses are optional Services by
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
the way according to statutes not
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
provided inadequate education
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
improve and expand child welfare
 
00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:44.049 align:start position:0%
improve and expand child welfare
services

00:31:44.049 --> 00:31:44.059 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in the community we
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
can't all afford sros
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development practices actually
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
the goals of some of these are part of
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
what schools do but I perceive this
 
00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
language as saying now you got to take
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
on more and you've got to be the Hub and
 
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
you got to be able to tend to the whole
 
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.130 align:start position:0%
you got to be able to tend to the whole
child

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
whether the parent does or not but
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
addressing specifically F on financial
 
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.730 align:start position:0%
addressing specifically F on financial
plan

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how many school board
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
members you how many school board
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
meetings you've attended you may have
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
attended many
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
but for the three school boards that
 
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
I've worked at at least at a minimum if
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
not every other week at least once a
 
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.370 align:start position:0%
not every other week at least once a
month

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
all the warrants and expenditures are
 
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
itemized x amount of books x amount of
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
jerseys with the prices the vendor and
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
those have to be approved by a school
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
board and those are public documents so
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what other Financial
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
accountability you'd be looking for
 
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
that's not already in a required warrant
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
for public is there something else
 
00:32:54.049 --> 00:32:54.059 align:start position:0%
you're looking for no the idea was these
 
00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:56.330 align:start position:0%
you're looking for no the idea was these
are

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
these are places for the superintendent
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
well the whole Community because the
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
part above that says we're all going to
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
be in on this right and and addressing
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
the whole Community all the stakeholders
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
whatever the one who's fine is
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for finalizing the plan is
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
the superintendent after taking into
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
consideration the input
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
from everybody you know the teachers the
 
00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:25.019 align:start position:0%
the parents the businesses Etc and these
 
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
are the steps
 
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
not that he not that the superintendent
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
is going to come up with entirely
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
themselves but with all of that their
 
00:33:38.169 --> 00:33:38.179 align:start position:0%
job is to to put it together in a plan
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
and the steps to improve might just be
 
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
making sure that all the parents know
 
00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
that these are the resources available
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
to them I mean it's not it's not saying
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
you have to that's why I was trying to
 
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
say you don't have to say the school has
 
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
to provide all of this but the steps
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
might be the school has to provide the
 
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
information you know we're going to make
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
sure that every parent knows that this
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
is available and that might be all of
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
the step that they decide to do or they
 
00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
may decide more based on their you know
 
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
they it I can't say what it's going to
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
look like because it's completely school
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
to school and time thank you very much
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
um I have uh one last question to ask of
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
you here because I know we have a number
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
of other people probably would like to
 
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
speak on this as well but in near
 
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
opening statement you mentioned that
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
schools be accountable for State funds
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
um are you talking about the grants that
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
come out that are not part of base
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy and disparity differential and
 
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid which are mandated by
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
the Londonderry and Claremont type
 
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
decisions and they're unrestricted
 
00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:50.099 align:start position:0%
monies and or are you are you talking
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
about changing the whole format where
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
there to receive these you're going to
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
have to x y and z
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying what they have to be
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
spent for I'm only saying that they have
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
to come up with a plan and let us know
 
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:09.260 align:start position:0%
what their plan for using that money is
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just here's some money
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
have at it
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
we give them extra money for
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
um for instance English language
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
Learners that's one of the things we
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
give so what are they going to do to
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
improve what are they going to do with
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
this money to help English language
 
00:35:28.619 --> 00:35:31.010 align:start position:0%
this money to help English language
learners

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
learners
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
we give them extra money if they have
 
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
um more free and reduced lunch so
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
because they have that part I don't want
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
to be argumentative here but we are
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
required by the court system
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the cases which we have to identify
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
ell free and reduce special education
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
and remedial reading Etc in
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and every child gets
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
the same amount proportionally to that
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
formula that we have established right
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
how can you then then say that turn
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
around and say that you're gonna in
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
order to receive those monies you're
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
going to do have to X Y and Z when we do
 
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
that possibly possibly for specific
 
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:16.940 align:start position:0%
grants which are outside of the
 
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
all I'm asking is that they have a plan
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
for what they're going to do with that
 
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
instead of just putting into to the
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's like if you're getting that extra
 
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
money it's not yes you have to spend it
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
for we're not telling them how to spend
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
it we're saying
 
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
we're asking them we're giving you this
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
extra money what are you going to spend
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
it on to help those populations
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
so we're asking them yes it's
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
unrestricted we can't tell them what to
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
do with it but we can ask them at least
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
to try to think about what are they
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
going to do with this money we're giving
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
them the money how are they going to
 
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
improve those populations after all
 
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
isn't that why they're getting extra for
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
English language learners
 
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
so that they can improve the outcomes of
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
English language Learners so do they
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
have a plan are they planning on using
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
it to improve it I mean that's the point
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh one one last one from
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock then we're going
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
to have to get other people we're going
 
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
to be cruising in on the limit of time
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
we have for this Bill thank you chairman
 
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
um I have one question two questions the
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
first one is following on Mike's thing
 
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
and Corinne's uh on the second uh the
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
first page just specifically the time of
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
the Workforce Development on lines 24
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
and 25 it says the schools will provide
 
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
students and family with meaningful
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
employment skills and opportunities does
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
that mean we're going to be using
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
student funds to do uh development and
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
skill training for parents in the
 
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.710 align:start position:0%
skill training for parents in the
schools

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
the schools are often owned by the town
 
00:38:08.089 --> 00:38:08.099 align:start position:0%
and I have seen in our school system
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
where the school has arranged to have
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
speakers or whatever come in in the
 
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
evenings and give
 
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.170 align:start position:0%
evenings and give
um

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:17.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
employment skills that's not speakers
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
skills odd skills
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
that's what I was saying having people
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
come in on the weekends or the evenings
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
and use those school facilities okay
 
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
to come and teach particular skills and
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are ones that will do it for their
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
organizations that will do it for free
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
there are businesses that will do it for
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
free so it's not necessarily using other
 
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
than the school facilities
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
actually spending the money that was
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
meant for the students the follow-up is
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
the primary question goes back to the
 
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
funding under lines 35 and 6 on page two
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
into three where it talks about the
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh creating all these
 
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
plans specifically to individual schools
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
and then specifically for English
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
language Learners low-income students
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
special needs as you can see I I
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
Envision a superintendent put in hours
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
and hours and hours creating a plan of
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
all these programs that are going to
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
support and assist say low-income
 
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
students and yet not have the money to
 
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
do it so like false expectations these
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
are the things we need to make the
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
program grow but we don't have money for
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
it which which concerns me of going
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
through all all that work for
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
superintendent because the money is not
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
there I mean this plan that you're
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
talking about that that fine Democratic
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
plan to re do Educational Funding it
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't a democratic plan I think
 
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd was a critical piece
 
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
of Representative luno it had University
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
people want to have Financial ideas on
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
us but the point is that was
 
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
redistributing a formula of how Avery
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
provided right and none of it shows has
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
a superintendent allocating by building
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
by district and I'm just concerned that
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
without the the entire Bill the entire
 
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism that supports the
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
language of this it's like taking one
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
piece it doesn't fit the rest of the The
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
Design This Limitless concerns a
 
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
question out of all that representation
 
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:14.500 align:start position:0%
yes do you agree
 
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:18.430 align:start position:0%
yes do you agree
[Laughter]

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
we keep redesigning the funding formula
 
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
I think every year we have some new way
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
of doing it or some bit so the question
 
00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:28.490 align:start position:0%
of doing it or some bit so the question
is

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
you're getting this money this doesn't
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
always work well no okay what I agree is
 
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
there's x amount of money coming in how
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
are you going to use it that's the
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
question how are you going to how are
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
you going to use what you have thank you
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I thought we had
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
some pink cards here we don't even have
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
any more pink cards on this thing so we
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
have another four minutes or so I mean I
 
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
didn't expect coming in from out there
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the neighborhood
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't figure they cared
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
um yes representative
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
represent dry thank you Mr chairman
 
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
um there's no fiscal note attached to
 
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
this I'm assuming a lot of stuff already
 
00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:17.339 align:start position:0%
exists on somewhere somebody's desk and
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of these
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
um points but do you what do you
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate for a fiscal note
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
I don't in well it's possible
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
that the doe may or may not I mean this
 
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
is partly their responsibility already
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
um May request
 
00:41:39.849 --> 00:41:39.859 align:start position:0%
that they get something I'm not sure but
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
really what this is
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
how are you spending the money that
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
you're getting right not how are we
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to give you more money we keep
 
00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:50.099 align:start position:0%
giving more money and we may still do
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
that that's separate from this
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
we give the money but how are we going
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
to use it that's really what this is
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
about how are you going to use it to
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question following up on
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative drive's question
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the collaboration
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
described in this bill among many
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
parties and the amount of reporting does
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
have an expense attached to it the
 
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
superintendent or whoever is creating
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
these plans isn't doing something else
 
00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:29.750 align:start position:0%
these plans isn't doing something else
so

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how to make that into a
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
question I just don't understand how
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
this is free
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
um partly because I believe this is
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
already the superintendent's
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility and I know in our town
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
we do have all of the we do have isn't
 
00:42:47.329 --> 00:42:47.339 align:start position:0%
it to decide how your school is going to
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
run and what plans you have and how you
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
want to improve it
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy to hear from the
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
superintendent if I'm wrong I I don't
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
ask the superintendent we had we have
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
several administrators I mean quite well
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
but two if she would like to respond to
 
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
that she doesn't have because the person
 
00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:08.099 align:start position:0%
testifying can't ask a question of
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what your question is you
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
may have to reiterate it but my question
 
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
to you is would you consider an
 
00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.470 align:start position:0%
to you is would you consider an
amendment

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
that adds the hiring of an assistant to
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
provide support and manpower to be able
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
to accomplish even half of this in my
 
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
district there were no assistant any
 
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.849 align:start position:0%
district there were no assistant any
things

00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
you're it
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
and so in terms of the time frame
 
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
you need another person so are you
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
willing to put an amendment that adds a
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
staff person to the districts that don't
 
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
well either that if we do that then we
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
would the state would have to pay for
 
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.790 align:start position:0%
would the state would have to pay for
that

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.329 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:43:58.329 --> 00:43:58.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
I would be interested in hearing what
 
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
things in particular a superintendent
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
that you would need somebody else to be
 
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:14.089 align:start position:0%
that you would need somebody else to be
doing

00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
well I'm just going to put something out
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
here I mean we can we can work this as a
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
work you know it's not an early bill
 
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
right we can
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
well that I'm going to respond to that
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
so the general public knows what is the
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
requirement when we put early on a bill
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
in terms of a financial note has to be
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
over five hundred thousand dollars I
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
think we're in that neighborhood plus
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
here with the question that representing
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
cascadden was just asking if it becomes
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
that we have the responsibility to
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
recognize that and shove this on as an
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
early bill
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
so it appears to me that without you
 
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
know having a more thorough
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
understanding of this we're not going to
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
be able to get this out by the 16th of
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
this month
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
I didn't expect to okay
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden
 
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.290 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden
sure

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
um I have a doctorate in teaching and
 
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.950 align:start position:0%
um I have a doctorate in teaching and
learning

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
learning
 
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
and that's what I do
 
00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
as a superintendent
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
I'm not expecting
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
to reach out and raise a child because
 
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
it's a partnership with a parent and a
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
parent needs to raise the child the
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
school needs to teach and learn
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's my answer I agree and the
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
responsibility as I said of the
 
00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:29.220 align:start position:0%
superintendent was to submit the plan
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
everybody was to work together to help
 
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
come up with the plan and I know we've
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
been doing that in our town with public
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
extra public not public hearings but
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
actually public joint Community getting
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
together and working we have
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
um and there'll be like an hour of
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
unrestricted where everybody just goes
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
around and
 
00:45:51.609 --> 00:45:51.619 align:start position:0%
talks to every you know it's kind of
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's there and we all talk to
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
each other make suggestions and whatever
 
00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:57.020 align:start position:0%
and then there's a time of more
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
controlled question and answer and then
 
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
they can take that so so and that's
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
you know I can see where I
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
I am not expecting one person the
 
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
superintendent to do this all by
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
themselves I'm expecting this to be a
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
community effort
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
the superintendent is just responsible
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure it happens and to submit
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
00:46:24.599 --> 00:46:27.710 align:start position:0%
does that help
s okay

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
one more question to you here
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative uh Lucas yes do you
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
believe this bill is ready
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
do you believe if this bill is not ready
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
do you think this committee is going to
 
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
have this ready to get out of here by
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
I do not believe this bill is ready
 
00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
I would even be fine with retaining this
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
bill as long as we're actually working
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
on it to make it something that is
 
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.650 align:start position:0%
on it to make it something that is
functional

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
functional
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Damon do you have a
 
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.829 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Damon do you have a
question

00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.210 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
so

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
correct me if I miss her but I believe
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
in your discussion responding to
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden you indicated
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
that the superintendents are already
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
doing this and that
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
essentially it seemed to me like you
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
were saying it wasn't an added workload
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
so if it's already happening I'm not
 
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
clear on why we need this spell
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
the what I was saying is that they are
 
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
responsible for overseeing the district
 
00:47:28.859 --> 00:47:30.530 align:start position:0%
responsible for overseeing the district
and

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
what happens within the district
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
and their responsibility in this is to
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
get the community and input from
 
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
everybody to come up with an improvement
 
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.990 align:start position:0%
everybody to come up with an improvement
plan

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
which I don't believe they are doing but
 
00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
I believe it is still their
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility now to get input from the
 
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.609 align:start position:0%
responsibility now to get input from the
community

00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
Etc to see so
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's like I believe they should be I do
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
not believe they all are
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
but I believe they should be getting
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
doing this already
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
this is to make sure that yes they are
 
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
they are pulling in
 
00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:14.579 align:start position:0%
you know if I was superintendent and my
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
school was not doing well I would be
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
turning to everybody the community
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
having Community hearings Etc trying to
 
00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:23.339 align:start position:0%
come up with how are we going to fix
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
this how are we going to improve this I
 
00:48:28.849 --> 00:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
would think that was part of what
 
00:48:28.859 --> 00:48:30.349 align:start position:0%
would think that was part of what
so

00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you not having any other questions
 
00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:35.579 align:start position:0%

has been referred to in some places as
 
00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
Banning books but that's not the intent
 
00:51:01.809 --> 00:51:01.819 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
as parents we do much to protect our
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
children from all sorts of things
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
provide a safe environment we have
 
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
parental controls on TV movies have
 
00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.010 align:start position:0%
parental controls on TV movies have
ratings

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:18.020 align:start position:0%
ratings
 
00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:21.059 align:start position:0%
do all sorts of things including I
 
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
remember the days when I had my desktop
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
computer and we had that in a public
 
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
place so we could see what the kids were
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
doing on the internet and so forth but
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
technology has changed that and I'm not
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
sure if it's all for the better
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
but uh certainly we've talked about
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
um sending our children to
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
school to be in a safe welcoming
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
learning environment
 
00:51:47.579 --> 00:51:48.290 align:start position:0%
learning environment
um

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
and I'm submitting this bill because I
 
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
realized that
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
our state obscenity laws
 
00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.950 align:start position:0%
our state obscenity laws
exclude

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
exclude
 
00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.049 align:start position:0%
exclude
education

00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
from the laws
 
00:52:06.119 --> 00:52:07.849 align:start position:0%
from the laws
and

00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that contributes to
 
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
having schools as a a welcoming
 
00:52:14.339 --> 00:52:16.370 align:start position:0%
having schools as a a welcoming
environment

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
um a safe environment for our children
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does in the first
 
00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:25.700 align:start position:0%
section is
 
00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:29.099 align:start position:0%
remove K-12 education
 
00:52:32.109 --> 00:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
from those exemptions
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
it leaves higher education in their I'm
 
00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
not touching that but for K-12 education
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
I do not think they should be exempt
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
from our obscenity laws
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
um that's the case in quite a number of
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
states and I believe there are some
 
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.630 align:start position:0%
states and I believe there are some
states

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
um looking at doing similar things
 
00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.589 align:start position:0%
um looking at doing similar things
but

00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:57.599 --> 00:52:58.190 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's a required step uh you know
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
some people will
 
00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.130 align:start position:0%
some people will
um

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
probably uh behind me uh talk about some
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
of the materials they found
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
objectionable in in their schools
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
um but the second part of the bill lays
 
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
out a process for any parent who does
 
00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:23.339 align:start position:0%
find objectionable materials whether it
 
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
be an app or a uh or a book or or
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
whatever materials
 
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
so that's the second part
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
um so that parents have some recourse if
 
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
they do find objectionable materials
 
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.030 align:start position:0%
they do find objectionable materials
um

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
and part of that process is going
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
through the superintendent and the local
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
school board and I think that's
 
00:53:51.839 --> 00:53:53.230 align:start position:0%
school board and I think that's
important

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
if we look at the Island Trees versus
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.569 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:54:01.569 --> 00:54:01.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
the plurality of Brennan Marshall and
 
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
Stevens said this
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
we are therefore in full agreement with
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
the petitioners that the local school
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
boards must be permitted to establish
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
and apply their curriculum in such a way
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
as to transmit Community Values
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
and there is a legitimate and
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
substantial Community interest in
 
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
promoting respect for authority and
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
Traditional Values to be social moral
 
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
and political
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
so we are adhering to that with this
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
process in providing the school board
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
with their decision-making process to
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
look at what someone might a parent
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
might come forward with objectionable
 
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.849 align:start position:0%
might come forward with objectionable
materials

00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.859 --> 00:54:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:52.700 align:start position:0%
they are again in the same decision
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
Justice Berger Powell rehnquist and
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
O'Connor said this
 
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
um the administration of the public
 
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
schools there is to be
 
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.809 align:start position:0%
schools there is to be
uh

00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
Traditional Values they be they social
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
moral political
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
if as we have held schools May
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
legitimately be used as vehicles for
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
income inculcating fundamental values
 
00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:20.339 align:start position:0%
necessary to the maintenance of a
 
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
democratic political system School
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
authorities have broad discretion to
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
fulfill that obligation
 
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.750 align:start position:0%
fulfill that obligation
so

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
laying out the process for parents I
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
think is in line with the Pico decision
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
and that it provides the school board
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
with decision making Pro process for
 
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
determining if the materials brought
 
00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
forward to them by parents are a
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate and adhering to Community
 
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.430 align:start position:0%
legitimate and adhering to Community
Values

00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
Values
 
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh but I think the basic premise is
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
obscenity laws
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
for New York or any other state should
 
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
not uh should not exclude K-12 education
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much other
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
questions for representative cordelli
 
00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for bringing
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I believe we're going to hear a
 
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
number of arguments today I think a lot
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
of them are going to hinge on the
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
concept of free speech
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
so what I would like to ask you is
 
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
in our constitutions where free speech
 
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
is protected
 
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
is the protection for free speech
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
applicable to Citizens or is it
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
where the Constitution here and over
 
00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
here we're the Constitution protects
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
free speech is that a protection that is
 
00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:56.579 align:start position:0%
granted for citizens to have free speech
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
or for government to have free speech
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
I I think the basic premise is that
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
individuals have free speech
 
00:57:09.049 --> 00:57:09.059 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
I think this is in line with that in
 
00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:13.690 align:start position:0%
I think this is in line with that in
that

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:13.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
anyone can
 
00:57:19.609 --> 00:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
come forward with an objection as a
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
parent but likewise the school board who
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
has ultimate decision-making Authority
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
as held in many law uh cases should have
 
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:35.780 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that and
 
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
students Librarians Etc are free to
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
exercise their opinion in discussing the
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
issue with the school board
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
um so given that the Constitutional
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
protection on Free Speech applies to
 
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
Citizens not to government does this
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
burden the Free Speech rights of
 
00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.710 align:start position:0%
burden the Free Speech rights of
citizens

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
does I'm sorry I'm not sure what does
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
what burden I guess what I'm trying to
 
00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:08.579 align:start position:0%
ask is if Mr chair
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
um the the First Amendment to the US
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution even isn't even being
 
00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:21.059 align:start position:0%
reflected properly here and and I you
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
know I'm not quite sure where we're
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
going okay so I think what we ought to
 
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
do is
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
ask the question don't ask a number of
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
questions leading up to what you're
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
trying to attain you see where I'm going
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
100 I'm just trying to get to the heart
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
of the issue of the matter of the
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
Constitutional perspective protection on
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
Free Speech and if it applies to protect
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
the free speech of citizens it applies
 
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:46.460 align:start position:0%
to protect the free speeches
 
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
no no I mean we need to be asking a
 
00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:53.579 align:start position:0%
specific question to the person that's
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
testifying right now
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
understood then my question would be
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
does this place any burden on the Free
 
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
Speech rights of the citizens of this
 
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.470 align:start position:0%
Speech rights of the citizens of this
state

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
I I do not believe it restricts Free
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
Speech rights
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
for the question represent cascadden
 
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
um first of all there are quite a few
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
safeguards in a public school because
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
you have licensed people your criminal
 
00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
records checks on staff and whatnot
 
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if you're aware but
 
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
School Board policy ige allows parental
 
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.130 align:start position:0%
School Board policy ige allows parental
objections

00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
objections
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
um policy ijk ijl are all specific to
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
that material so I really don't see the
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
need for this Bill thank you is there a
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
question oh question is are you familiar
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
with those
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh no I'm not familiar with all those
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
school policies but I think that this
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
needs to be in law because right now
 
00:59:53.339 --> 00:59:55.270 align:start position:0%
needs to be in law because right now
K-12

00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
K-12
 
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:58.140 align:start position:0%
schools are exempt from our obscenity
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
laws and I think that that needs to be
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
changed and I think that's the basic uh
 
01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
thing that we're addressing here I'm not
 
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
as concerned with school policy I'm
 
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
concerned with state law just a very
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
very quick one so my question as a
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up is are you aware of what's
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
already being done
 
01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.789 align:start position:0%
already being done
foreign

01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
I am aware of lots of things going on in
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
various school districts in the state
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
I'm looking specifically on page two
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
line 11 but there is multiple places
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
within this bill where it says the
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
school principal or his or her designee
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
would you see that some school districts
 
01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
if the principal is overburdened with
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
other tasks that they need to
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
designate a permanent person or maybe
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
even create a new job position to be in
 
01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
charge of handling these complaints with
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
obscene material I think provision for
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
the principal or destiny satisfies the
 
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:07.069 align:start position:0%
the principal or destiny satisfies the
need

01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
is from the committee represent woodcock
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman LED
 
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
um I may follow up Rosanna cordelli on
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
President McDonald's question
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
specifically to that line of the school
 
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.589 align:start position:0%
specifically to that line of the school
principal

01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
principal
 
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
um it appears to me that uh with this
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
person or designate is making the
 
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
determination because they shall
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
determine if it's objectionable right
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
that what a material and representative
 
01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:35.339 align:start position:0%
McDonald's School whose principal as
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
compared to the school I'm principle of
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
how we determine what's objectable and
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
not maybe totally different we may have
 
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
the same item and be totally different
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking for how is there
 
01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
something consistent in that uh in my
 
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
question thank you I think as we
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
um we mentioned in the Pico decision it
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
talked about Community Values and I
 
01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:00.740 align:start position:0%
think that that's reflected
 
01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:04.460 align:start position:0%
throughout statute so in your community
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
in the North Country Community Values
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
could differ from a community in
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
but that's a community decision that's a
 
01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:18.740 align:start position:0%
local school board decision and
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
based on objections of parents if they
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
is that one quick call
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
very quickly because I would like to get
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
out of here yeah thank you so it's CR
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
you're it's accurate to say then there's
 
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
something that might be maybe you've
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
seen in place though is not obscene in
 
01:02:37.079 --> 01:02:38.809 align:start position:0%
seen in place though is not obscene in
Pittsburgh

01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
that's a local school board decision
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
based on objection raised by a parent
 
01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:44.940 align:start position:0%

not sure
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
where you were going I don't know where
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
I was going with it is this policy just
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
relating to parents or guardians or for
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
the general Community as a whole that
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
would come into the school board or
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
object to any kind of Publications
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
objections raised by parents or
 
01:03:45.839 --> 01:03:48.170 align:start position:0%
objections raised by parents or
Guardians

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:48.180 align:start position:0%

representative miler thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question Mr
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli I want to follow up with a
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
comment you made earlier regarding local
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
the Aegis of local issues around this
 
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
particular topic uh we're aware that
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
local school boards currently have these
 
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
kinds of complaint policies so is it
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
your concern that this needs to be a
 
01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
state law because you don't feel that
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
local school boards are doing their job
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
as it relates to this policies relating
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
I I think that I'm not sure what happens
 
01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
in every school district in the state
 
01:04:36.849 --> 01:04:36.859 align:start position:0%
but I think that there needs to be
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
consistency in place and that parents
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
have that ability to present
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
objectionable materials and to get a
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
resolution and decision from the local
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
board oh please yes so follow-up then
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
you're not sure exactly what is
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
happening at the local level then is
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
not not throughout the state
 
01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
um you know we've we've seen newspaper
 
01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.730 align:start position:0%
um you know we've we've seen newspaper
reports

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
um continually about
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
um situations arising and parent uh
 
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.089 align:start position:0%
um situations arising and parent uh
objections

01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
objections
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that uh trying to
 
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
address that and provide a mechanism for
 
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
those parents to make sure that they
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism uh mechanism for
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
um bringing forward issues that they
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
believe uh are inappropriate for their
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
minor children
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh that might run afoul of our
 
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
obscenity laws thank you thank you are
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
there further questions just
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner does this have a
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty to it this law
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh I don't believe there is anything in
 
01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.589 align:start position:0%
uh I don't believe there is anything in
there

01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:05:48.599 --> 01:05:49.609 align:start position:0%
there
um

01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
the agreed uh to to uh the to the
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education to the
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education does it does it
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
end up in a
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
I don't think that I don't think that
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has any ability to
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
launch Criminal
 
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.710 align:start position:0%
launch Criminal
um

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh any kind of criminal action
 
01:06:15.609 --> 01:06:15.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
well are we finished over there yes
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:25.740 align:start position:0%
on the last page of the criminal code
 
01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
chapter 650 obscene matter Roman numeral
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
number three reads
 
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
state or any dependent May appeal from a
 
01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
judgment such appeal shall not stay the
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
judgment and then any defendant engaging
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
in conduct prohibited by this chapter
 
01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:41.339 align:start position:0%
subsequent to the notice of the Judgment
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
finding the material to be obscene
 
01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
matter shall be subject to criminal
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
prosecution notwithstanding the appeal
 
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
from the judgment
 
01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
so that sounds pretty serious to me
 
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
is there a question there
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
no we need we need to have questions
 
01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.490 align:start position:0%
no we need we need to have questions
please

01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
further questions if I could clarify I I
 
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
was answering the questions about the
 
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner's ability to uh take a
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
criminal action
 
01:07:09.529 --> 01:07:09.539 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes representino
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair representative
 
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
cordelli one of the things that has
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
surprised me is how many people have
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
come forward showing me material that
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
they have been that has been distributed
 
01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
to their children or that the children
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
have access to in school and I'm
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
surprised that they're reaching out to
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
me as a state representative to do
 
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
something about it I'm wondering if
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
you've had similar experiences that
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
would have led to you
 
01:07:38.329 --> 01:07:38.339 align:start position:0%
thinking this legislation was necessary
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes I I think we've probably all
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
received uh correspondence from
 
01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.109 align:start position:0%
received uh correspondence from
constituents

01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
um and seeing newspaper reports
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
um and one of the that plus uh an
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
article that I read in the National
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
publication about uh state obscenity
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
laws and education led me to filing this
 
01:08:01.079 --> 01:08:02.270 align:start position:0%
laws and education led me to filing this
legislation

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:08:04.609 --> 01:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions not seeing
 
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
any from the committee thank you very
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
much representative cordelli I'd like to
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
welcome representative David page
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:08:22.329 --> 01:08:22.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
to the members of the committee for uh
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
considering my testimony today
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh I'm representative David page and I'm
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
lucky to represent my neighbors in the
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
town of Conway
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
I have also been fortunate over the last
 
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
many years to have worked very closely
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
side by side with Educators Librarians
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
and local boards all across the United
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
States as they've navigated our
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
country's escalating crisis for book
 
01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:55.249 align:start position:0%
country's escalating crisis for book
Banning

01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
Banning
 
01:08:55.259 --> 01:08:56.570 align:start position:0%
Banning
so

01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
let me tell you what this crisis looks
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
like in two simple numbers
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
the American Library Association
 
01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:09.140 align:start position:0%
received reports of 1
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
597 different books different titles
 
01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
either banned or unsuccessfully targeted
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
by bands
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
at the time this number
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
1597 different book titles was a record
 
01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
preliminary data
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
from Ala for 2022
 
01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:35.060 align:start position:0%
is that we saw 2
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
548 unique book titles targeted that is
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
roughly a sixty percent increase in
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
censorship activity in a single year in
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
one year
 
01:09:51.769 --> 01:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
and I come here today to share the
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
perspective that I've gained through my
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
work over the last decade addressing
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
start with what I hope are some clear
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
the first one I hope
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
we all share the belief
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
that every parent
 
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
has the right to determine what is
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for his or her own child
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
to put it another way I do not believe
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
that it is my place to tell you
 
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
what your child should or should not be
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to read I will always defend
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
your right as a parent to make that
 
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
determination for your kid
 
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
and in return
 
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
I ask you the same courtesy
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
not to tell me what my child should or
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
a second point of agreement
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
we all agree we all agree there needs to
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
be a mechanism for concerned parents to
 
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
raise complaints and request
 
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of materials in schools
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
fortunately and as representative
 
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
cascadden observed earlier this
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism already exists
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
this mechanism exists in the form of
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
locally determined District Challenge
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
agreement I'd like to emphasize and it
 
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
seems silly to even have to say this
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
schools are not Distributing pornography
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
let's put it plainly we all agree we all
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
agree pornography has no place in our
 
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
schools every teacher every parent every
 
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
administrator every legislator agrees on
 
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.649 align:start position:0%
administrator every legislator agrees on
this

01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
but let's be real with ourselves about
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
how miners today are accessing
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
pornographic materials because there are
 
01:11:59.159 --> 01:12:00.229 align:start position:0%
pornographic materials because there are
problems

01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
we know for example that the majority of
 
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.550 align:start position:0%
we know for example that the majority of
teens

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
teens
 
01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
have viewed pornography on their phones
 
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
a majority right and even more
 
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.149 align:start position:0%
a majority right and even more
alarmingly

01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
alarmingly
 
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
a Common Sense Media survey showed that
 
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
45 percent of teens feel that online
 
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
pornography has given them helpful
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
information about sex all right
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
so there are real problems right if we
 
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
want to be serious about protecting
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
miners from obscene material let's begin
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
with an understanding of how our teens
 
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
are actually encountering these
 
01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.229 align:start position:0%
are actually encountering these
materials

01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
materials
 
01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
and that quite simply if they're seeking
 
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
out these materials they are not doing
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
it by going to their school library
 
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
Stacks they are not doing it through an
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
English language arts assignment okay
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's not happening not in this day and
 
01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
age that's not where they're finding it
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
so this bill is not going to eliminate
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
our kids access to obscene materials
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
it absolutely will however
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
create a number of troubling problems
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
for both students and the Educators who
 
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
first and most egregiously this bill
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
takes the remarkable step of stripping
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
K-12 educators of their long-standing
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
protection under the law from being
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
arrested charged or indicted prior to
 
01:13:24.169 --> 01:13:24.179 align:start position:0%
any Court determination that educational
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
materials that they've made available
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
are in fact obscene in nature okay
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
um you know and I heard representative
 
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
cordelli say they're exempt from the law
 
01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
they're not exempt from the obscenity
 
01:13:35.699 --> 01:13:36.530 align:start position:0%
they're not exempt from the obscenity
law

01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
it has to be proven that the material is
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
obscene right it's not like a free pass
 
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.890 align:start position:0%
obscene right it's not like a free pass
here

01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to belabor this point
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
since I'm sure there are others
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
testifying who can speak to this better
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
than I can but the ramifications of this
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
change are momentous
 
01:13:54.649 --> 01:13:54.659 align:start position:0%
and not only is the criminalization of
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
teachers in itself troubling
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
but the ways in which it will force
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
teachers to change their practice are
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
second we know exactly what the
 
01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
Practical effect of this legislation
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
will be on the ground we do not have to
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
do any guessing here
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
we'll probably see very few instances of
 
01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
a court determining that educational
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
materials are obscene probably none and
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
why is that because Schools they're just
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
not using or collecting materials that
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
meet a legal definition of obscenity
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
in spite of this
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
the impact will be real and significant
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
administrators and their employees will
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
choose to operate within a safe harbor
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to deliberately make
 
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
choices to avoid potential controversy
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
and to avoid the risk of getting
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
embroiled in litigation
 
01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
we have abundant scholarly research and
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
data on the topic of self-censorship in
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
schools the phenomenon is real it is
 
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
pervasive and it is well documented that
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
that self-censorship activity is getting
 
01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
worse following the passage of laws such
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
as this one and so what does
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
distribution represent how much more do
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
you have you we're running out of time
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
here I've got about a minute thank you
 
01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.850 align:start position:0%
here I've got about a minute thank you
yep

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
well we have the benefit of over three
 
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
decades of data collected on book
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
Banning by the American Library
 
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
Association and we can easily see broad
 
01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
patterns emerge the first and most
 
01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
obvious pattern is this
 
01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
the majority a majority of those titles
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
targeted by book bands those 2 000 plus
 
01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:38.510 align:start position:0%
targeted by book bands those 2 000 plus
titles

01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
titles
 
01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
are by or about black people or buy or
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
about LGBT people
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
the direct effect of this law whether
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's the intention or not will be to
 
01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
limit schools purchasing of materials
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
buying about those populations as they
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
work to build curriculum and collections
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
that reflect and serve their student
 
01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.910 align:start position:0%
that reflect and serve their student
bodies

01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
01:16:00.649 --> 01:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
so here's the good news
 
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
public opinion research has consistently
 
01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
shown that a majority of Republicans
 
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
oppose book Banning that a majority of
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
Democrats oppose book Banning and a
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
majority of Independents oppose book
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
Banning there's broad public awareness
 
01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
of the crisis and in the most recent
 
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
major poll conducted in September of
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
last year by a nonpartisan public
 
01:16:26.689 --> 01:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
opinion research firm
 
01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh nearly all voters were aware of this
 
01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:30.770 align:start position:0%
uh nearly all voters were aware of this
crisis

01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
but of those polled the number that felt
 
01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
that there was a significant number of
 
01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
books in our schools that were cause for
 
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
concern it was only eight percent
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
eight percent
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
so I want to thank uh the committee for
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
your time and attention and I would ask
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
you to join me in stating clearly that
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
censorship is not a Granite State value
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
by voting in expedient to legislate on
 
01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
HB 514 thank you representative are
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
there questions from the uh for the
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative page
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
um can you explain to me what a book ban
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
actually looks like I mean if you remove
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
objectionable material from an
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
elementary school maybe it's available
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
at the middle school or is a book
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
Banning like
 
01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
completely eliminating that piece of
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
literature from our culture never to be
 
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
seen again I'm confused about what that
 
01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:25.100 align:start position:0%
ban actually means
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily mean that it has
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
to be eliminated from from everywhere I
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
will also say that there are instances
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
where a mistake can be made and that is
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
why we have Challenge and
 
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
reconsideration procedures this is part
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
of the profession so yes something could
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
be purchased for an elementary school
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
collection for a K5 library with the
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
best intentions it is later determined
 
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
oh that is really not age appropriate
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
and it should not be in our Elementary
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
School library it would go through that
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
process that would not be considered a
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
ban a band would be an attempt to remove
 
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
something because an individual parent
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
feels as I said it's not appropriate for
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
their kid and that parent I believe
 
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
should be able to say and they can say
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
my child will not have that cannot have
 
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
that but we're not going to then remove
 
01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
it uh from access for other children in
 
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
in the school or District if that makes
 
01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:20.870 align:start position:0%
in the school or District if that makes
sense

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Luna
 
01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:24.659 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
very much representative page for
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
um part of the um part of Public School
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh is defined as I believe it
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
includes a uh a live professional
 
01:18:39.649 --> 01:18:39.659 align:start position:0%
librarian uh for uh for every 500
 
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
students that's part of our definition
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
of adequacy and uh how it's funded and
 
01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
and I think we probably all realize that
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
you probably need to have more librarian
 
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
or media Specialists not not just one
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
for every 500 students but uh my my the
 
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
question to you though is
 
01:18:59.689 --> 01:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
for uh for our do professional
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
Librarians just buy any book that's out
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
there and put it on or do they uh our
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
school librarians really curating a
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
collection of books that are appropriate
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
for the the education of the children
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
that that school serves
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
the latter
 
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
um so the the choices made by the school
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
and first of all I should say there may
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
be others who can testify better to this
 
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
but I'll take a first stab for you
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
um the selection decisions of the school
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
librarian are going to be going to be
 
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
determined by the school or districts
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
collection collection development policy
 
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
which is going to seek to meet the
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
educational goals of that institution so
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
they're not being random here oftentimes
 
01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:44.219 align:start position:0%
it's going to vary a bit from school to
 
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
school district to District but
 
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there are requirements for
 
01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:50.219 align:start position:0%
example that they are going to look at a
 
01:19:51.649 --> 01:19:51.659 align:start position:0%
certain number of professional reviews
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
of the titles to determine their
 
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
appropriateness to determine the grade
 
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
range level so there's a lot that goes
 
01:19:59.689 --> 01:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
into every single one of those those
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
selection decisions I would also note
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
that the school Librarian Is uniquely
 
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
qualified to do this work folks often
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't know but our school librarians are
 
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
often some of our most highly trained
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
Educators in the building they've often
 
01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
been a classroom from teacher gone back
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
and gotten another degree or
 
01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:20.390 align:start position:0%
and gotten another degree or
certification

01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:23.219 align:start position:0%
they receive very specific training on
 
01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
this right it's a huge part of their
 
01:20:27.649 --> 01:20:27.659 align:start position:0%
graduate curriculum and they spend a lot
 
01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
of time talking about balancing the
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
needs of the whole Community about
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
protecting individual students rights
 
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
about representing the whole community
 
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
so this is very much Central to their
 
01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
training so it's not you know the it's
 
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
not random that this is the person doing
 
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
the work
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh yes
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative try thank you Mr chairman
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
um please help me out I'm looking at the
 
01:20:57.010 --> 01:20:57.020 align:start position:0%
the preliminary hearings in the code of
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
the criminal code and it was talking
 
01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
the criminal code and it was talking
about

01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
that no one is arrested or charged or
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
indicted unless the material is found to
 
01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
be obscene and they continue to make it
 
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
available I'm having a hard time
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
reconciling that with what you were
 
01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
talking about about being charged so my
 
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill and I mean you could
 
01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
certainly talk to the sponsor about this
 
01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:22.100 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
but my reading of the bill is that it
 
01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:26.219 align:start position:0%
has struck him out
 
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
schools and replaced it with
 
01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
so that it has removed that
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
that language as it regards our K-12
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
institutions does that clarify them yeah
 
01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.689 align:start position:0%
institutions does that clarify them yeah
follow-up

01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
well I I would like to see that I would
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
like to see that so whoever could answer
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
that question would be helpful thank you
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
chairman for the page good to see you
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
again good to see you long ride down I'm
 
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.430 align:start position:0%
again good to see you long ride down I'm
sure

01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:58.970 align:start position:0%
sure
um

01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
my question is earlier on there was a
 
01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
question I asked to the fire
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative if a book is pulled by a
 
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
consider obscene and plaster
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
and not considered of seeing a
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh how is it then of seeing
 
01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.689 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh how is it then of seeing
material

01:22:20.689 --> 01:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a couple there's a
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
couple things I'd emphasize first one is
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
a determination that it's obscene is not
 
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
necessarily the only consideration in
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
determining whether it belongs in in the
 
01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
collection so for example to
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative pedernal's point
 
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
during reconsideration process
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
it may be you know when when that Review
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
Committee typically it's done is by a
 
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
committee that has parent
 
01:22:51.169 --> 01:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
Representatives teacher or librarian Etc
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
will do the reconsider the review of the
 
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
material they will also read the whole
 
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
book as a committee they will look at it
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
it can be removed for another reason
 
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:02.219 align:start position:0%
that it then that it is obscene then it
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
meets the legal definition of obscenity
 
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
right so it may be removed just because
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
they say yeah this is not right for our
 
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
K-5 students we're not saying it's
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
obscene but it's not meeting our needs
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's not conforming to our collection
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
development plan so it doesn't have to
 
01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
just you know that's not the only reason
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
to remove something so I just state that
 
01:23:19.739 --> 01:23:20.930 align:start position:0%
to remove something so I just state that
first

01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges with this bill is
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
and I think you made this observation is
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
who is making the determination of
 
01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.410 align:start position:0%
who is making the determination of
obscenity

01:23:30.410 --> 01:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
obscenity
 
01:23:32.209 --> 01:23:32.219 align:start position:0%
I personally think that that
 
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
determination should really be made by a
 
01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:35.570 align:start position:0%
determination should really be made by a
lawyer

01:23:35.570 --> 01:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
um you know the the you put typically
 
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
you put things through various tests to
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
determine whether the material is
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
obscene one of those tests for example
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
is that it's devoid of educational
 
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
artistic Etc Merit
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of these materials it
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
would be hard to make a legal case that
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
that they are obscene what this bill
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
will do and I think this is to your
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
point is if it's the principle making
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
the determination in two different towns
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
they may reach two totally different
 
01:24:06.239 --> 01:24:09.850 align:start position:0%
they may reach two totally different
conclusions

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:09.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
the page further questions from the
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
01:24:17.209 --> 01:24:17.219 align:start position:0%

01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
the pink carts here and and most pink
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
cards are saying I need three minutes to
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
present so I'm going to put the three
 
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
minute rule in effect right now going
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
forward so the next person I'd like to
 
01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
come for is Barrett Christina
 
01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman lag good morning
 
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
members of the committee bear Christina
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
from the School Board Association thank
 
01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
you for taking my testimony nhsba's
 
01:25:00.169 --> 01:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
posed to House Bill 514
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
um a couple different aspects that I
 
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
um uh talk about on hsba's objection
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
um Provisions at the bottom of page one
 
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
where it says the school board shall
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
have a policy
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
um nhsva has no objection to the
 
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
legislature requiring school boards to
 
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
adopt a policy on this topic we do have
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
an objection though to the remainder of
 
01:25:24.290 --> 01:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
the legislation on page two that talks
 
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
about what has to be in the policy when
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli was giving his
 
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
init was introducing the bill he spoke
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
of a Supreme Court case and I believe he
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
said the court said the local school
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
board should establish a policy to
 
01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
adhere to the morality and values of
 
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
their Community by the legislature
 
01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
writing the policy for us it's not local
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
um writing policies relative to the
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
values of their specific community world
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
after policy we heard testimony that
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
many school boards already have policies
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
on these nhsba does have a sample policy
 
01:26:00.010 --> 01:26:00.020 align:start position:0%
I pulled off some
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
Haverhill has a policy Dairy has a
 
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
policy Hudson has a policy
 
01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.330 align:start position:0%
policy Hudson has a policy
uh

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:11.719 align:start position:0%
uh Wakefield has a policy playing field
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
Salem Timberlane Concord has a very
 
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
comprehensive policy why I didn't go
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
through everybody on the committee but I
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
think you get my point the other aspect
 
01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
that I want to make to
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
um is that
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
um there should not be an appeal to the
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh to the local or excuse me to the
 
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education putting that in
 
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
the hands of unelected bureaucrats
 
01:26:36.169 --> 01:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem prudent also if we're going
 
01:26:38.689 --> 01:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
to be looking at the definition I'm
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
sorry some language in RSA 650 the the
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
obscenity statute
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
um trying to find out where it is this
 
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
is RSA 650 colon one
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph 4A the material is obscene if
 
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
it is considered on the whole to the
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
average person a when applying the
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
Contemporary standards of the county
 
01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
within which the obscene offense was
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
committed so if the State Board is going
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
to be um being the final Arbiter of what
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
is obscene or what is not in a local
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
community we should add language to the
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
bill that the State Board is going to
 
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
establish criteria for all the 10
 
01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire and they
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
should post that publicly on the website
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
distribute that to all the parents
 
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
um in each of those specific counties so
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the criteria will be the
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
same in Hillsborough County it is in
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
co-host but the State Board should at
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
least be doing that they're going to be
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
given authority over what is obscene and
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
what is not so that's another objection
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
nhsba would have
 
01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.930 align:start position:0%
nhsba would have
um

01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:37.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh we have policies I spoke about that
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
the other aspects too I believe somebody
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned at RSA 186 colon 11 paragraph
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
9C is the opt out provision and I
 
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
believe I have that in front of me
 
01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:54.410 align:start position:0%
believe I have that in front of me
um

01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
school boards are required to adopt a
 
01:27:59.090 --> 01:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
policy allowing an exception to specific
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
course material based on a parent or
 
01:28:03.169 --> 01:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
legal Guardians that happened yesterday
 
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
when I was testifying too oh is that is
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
that the three minutes I apologize
 
01:28:10.330 --> 01:28:10.340 align:start position:0%
um or legal Gardens determination
 
01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
rc1 18611 C you have to have a policy
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
that allows parents to opt out if they
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
find the course material objectionable
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
anyway I could go on for a long time
 
01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
about this I know you got a lot of cards
 
01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
chairman lad three minutes uh we opposed
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
written testimony I scribble my notes
 
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
down and very good very well I've done
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
this before chairman Ladd I've heard it
 
01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:32.590 align:start position:0%
this before chairman Ladd I've heard it
before

01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions from the
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
committee for fair Christina
 
01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
from the School Board Association
 
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative luno sure thank you
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair
 
01:28:46.129 --> 01:28:46.139 align:start position:0%
um I I I actually I'm asking the
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
question because I wanted to give you a
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
little more time to answer particularly
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
with some details behind the the opt-out
 
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
policies that that families have right
 
01:28:57.649 --> 01:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
now sure that are in New Hampshire
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
statute not not not uh subject to school
 
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
boards yet they are currently the the
 
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
the reconsideration of instructional
 
01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
materials or reconsideration of Library
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
materials policy that nhsba has on the
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
books is not required by law it's
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
recommend nhsba has it as a recommended
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
policy and different school boards have
 
01:29:17.159 --> 01:29:18.229 align:start position:0%
policy and different school boards have
different

01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
um sort of levels of who's going to be
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
on a committee to review it I mean but
 
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
they're all generally the same but again
 
01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
not every I don't know every school
 
01:29:28.729 --> 01:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
board or whether or not they have this
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
but we have it on the books
 
01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
um it's a recommended policy from nhsba
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
if you want to mandate a policy that's
 
01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
fine we don't think the legislature
 
01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
should be writing local school board
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
policies though up I'm really asking
 
01:29:45.649 --> 01:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
about state law that that gives parents
 
01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
um rights to opt out of what what you
 
01:29:51.649 --> 01:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
know what as as representative page was
 
01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:53.219 align:start position:0%
saying yeah one parent might find
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
objectionable another parent might might
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
find appropriate that type of thing yeah
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
so what's I'm not sorry about that
 
01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:00.260 align:start position:0%
what's the question
 
01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
do we have state laws yes yes well yeah
 
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
this is RSA 186 colon 11 paragraph 9C
 
01:30:10.129 --> 01:30:10.139 align:start position:0%
school boards are required to adopt a
 
01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
policy allowing an exception to specific
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
course material based on a parent or
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
legal guardian's determination that the
 
01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
material is objectionable and then it
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
lists a couple other Provisions about
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
what you have to do in the policy so
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's a required policy by law and hsba
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
has that every school board should have
 
01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
that on the books and follow up on that
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
and that gives parents unilateral rights
 
01:30:33.649 --> 01:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
correct to that material correct correct
 
01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that policy
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
has been placed for quite a while I
 
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
think 2011 or so I think that I believe
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's when we put it in yeah
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
further questions of the school boards
 
01:30:44.570 --> 01:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
Association Nazi thank you very much
 
01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
very much I'd like call forward and
 
01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
um can I go a little bit later because I
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
think you think you receive these
 
01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:54.900 align:start position:0%
materials before I speak on my behalf so
 
01:30:57.129 --> 01:30:57.139 align:start position:0%
I would like maybe one of the parents
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
well I'll just take the next one in the
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
Heap here I've just work my way down
 
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:04.380 align:start position:0%

okay uh next one down is Betsy
Harrington

01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.689 --> 01:31:14.699 align:start position:0%
I really really appreciate you guys
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
having me today this is
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
this is something that came up last year
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
and it's been shocking to me ever since
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate you having me
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
my name is Betsy Harrington I'm from
 
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
Deering New Hampshire I'm hoping you
 
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
will give me the whole time today to
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
tell my story because I feel like I'm
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
the most informed parent in the room
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
although maybe not it seems like some
 
01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
others see what I have seen I'm praying
 
01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
that you will ask a ton of questions
 
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
about how our kids are getting exposed
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
and exploited I have sent a video to
 
01:31:47.689 --> 01:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
every one of you that's about a minute
 
01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:51.260 align:start position:0%
long and I also sent some links like to
 
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
ratedbooks.org ratedbooks.org you can go
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
and look and
 
01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:56.810 align:start position:0%
and look and
um

01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
see the excerpts that parents are
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
complaining about so if somebody were to
 
01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
say this book is bad and you didn't have
 
01:32:05.689 --> 01:32:05.699 align:start position:0%
time to read the whole book you could go
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
to that spot and say oh I see what you
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
mean just to know that if you challenge
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
a book you have to read the whole book
 
01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
but there are resources for us to look
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
and see what other parents are saying
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that so I wanted to
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
make sure you guys got that email
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%

01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:36.420 align:start position:0%

01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
I learned of the inappropriate content
 
01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
in the school's online library from my
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
son who attends Hillsborough during High
 
01:32:46.129 --> 01:32:46.139 align:start position:0%
School his 15 year old friend had the
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
soar Library app open and showed him how
 
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
the book lesbianist guide to Catholic
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
school was being advertised
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'll submit these so this is how it
 
01:32:58.129 --> 01:32:58.139 align:start position:0%
looked on his screen
 
01:32:58.139 --> 01:33:01.810 align:start position:0%
looked on his screen
and

01:33:01.810 --> 01:33:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%

01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
screenshots he was shocked and he knew
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
immediately that this was not for a
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
school library he brought it to his
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
English teacher the teacher said it was
 
01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
all fine to be available so my son read
 
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
the first page of the book out loud I've
 
01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
got that here I can't read it it's not
 
01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.850 align:start position:0%
got that here I can't read it it's not
readable

01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
readable
 
01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
so he read it out loud it was really
 
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
really offensive so he was in trouble
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
his point was made the principal saw it
 
01:33:32.689 --> 01:33:32.699 align:start position:0%
and just sent him to his next class
 
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
it started me looking though once my son
 
01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
told me what happened I insisted he show
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
me exactly it's been a shocking
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
Discovery ever since I read that book
 
01:33:43.729 --> 01:33:43.739 align:start position:0%
Let's be on his guide to Catholic school
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
then the other that was also
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
inappropriately advertised that day here
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
in queer both were explicitly sexual and
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
offensive throughout it made me realize
 
01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
our kids were indeed being advertised in
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate books through their school
 
01:33:59.209 --> 01:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
computers so I started looking for books
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
that other parents said were
 
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
questionable and how certain Burke's
 
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
books were being promoted
 
01:34:06.370 --> 01:34:06.380 align:start position:0%
I read the book flamer through the app
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
it was so graphically sexual and had so
 
01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
many inappropriate themes for children I
 
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
felt compelled to request a private
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
meeting with my school board the main
 
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
character is graphically sexually abused
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
by others and his confusion leads him to
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
attempt suicide this is a middle school
 
01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:22.610 align:start position:0%
attempt suicide this is a middle school
book

01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
book
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
my husband and I please allow me more
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
time well I'm going to give you one more
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
minute but that's it my husband and I
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
met with the school board on June 6th
 
01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
they listened and said just take the
 
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
library app off my kids computers and
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
the problem was solved I was quite aware
 
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
of the harms the other students were
 
01:34:40.729 --> 01:34:40.739 align:start position:0%
being subjected to but hope that someone
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
would look now that I had said something
 
01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
that never happened I continue to read
 
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
the books from the app becoming more and
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
more concerned about what I was finding
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
available to the students in my district
 
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
the most dangerous book I read so far is
 
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
this book is gay by Juno Dawson it has a
 
01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
section boldly titled how sex apps work
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
it has detailed explanations on how to
 
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
perform blowies and handys explaining to
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
everyone that everyone and I mean
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
everyone has anal sex and all men like
 
01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
to put things in their anus it explains
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
that bombing is a normal feeling of
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
wanting to put your penis in everything
 
01:35:17.689 --> 01:35:17.699 align:start position:0%
it's a perverted view of sex under this
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
the disguise of sex education it's
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
sexual misinformation that is openly
 
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
accessible to students at all times
 
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
without support the book also has an
 
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
embedded hyperlink to match.com
 
01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:33.179 align:start position:0%
and explains in detail how to use
 
01:35:35.209 --> 01:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
grinder for hookups
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
the embedded link the embedded hyperlink
 
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
is right at the part of the book that
 
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
gives sex app instructions you've gone
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
beyond that extra minute plus now
 
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
so we're going to open it up to
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions if you're willing to take
 
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:51.169 align:start position:0%
questions if you're willing to take
questions

01:35:51.169 --> 01:35:51.179 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%

chairman could you explain to me the
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
difference between things on an app and
 
01:36:08.770 --> 01:36:08.780 align:start position:0%
books in a library please thank you
 
01:36:11.689 --> 01:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
so that's a good question
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
um these books are not for the most part
 
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
in the physical Library they're mostly
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
on the soar student Library app so our
 
01:36:22.729 --> 01:36:22.739 align:start position:0%
student library is available to 53 000
 
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
districts around the country
 
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
our district uses something called the
 
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire shared collection and
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much used by most
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
districts in New Hampshire
 
01:36:37.129 --> 01:36:37.139 align:start position:0%
that is the particular catalog that is
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
full of sexually inappropriate books and
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
it is advertising them to my kids
 
01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
through their Chromebooks
 
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
so is this something that a school or a
 
01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
district signs into to make available in
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
my district we they they charge I think
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
250 dollars to have access to 8 000
 
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
books these books I I reviewed like like
 
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
kept going through them just to kind of
 
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
see what the overall content is I did a
 
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
search for Donald Trump in the Sora app
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
the only book that resulted was
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
his opponent I don't know if I have that
 
01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:19.310 align:start position:0%

and Joe Biden comes up in the library
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
Donald Trump's a writer Joe Biden's not
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
like the Sora Library app has an issue
 
01:37:46.729 --> 01:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
and the Librarians are not seeing that
 
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:49.980 align:start position:0%

01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
don't remove those kinds of materials we
 
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
are talking in this bill about
 
01:40:34.610 --> 01:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
pornographic and obscene material that
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
you have to have seen because I've seen
 
01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:39.179 align:start position:0%
it because I've had this parent and
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
other parents contact me and show it to
 
01:40:41.219 --> 01:40:42.169 align:start position:0%
other parents contact me and show it to
me

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
if parents and parents have taken this
 
01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
material and posted this on social media
 
01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
posted it on Facebook and their account
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
was suspended and the material was
 
01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:53.699 align:start position:0%
removed because it violates Community
 
01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
standards the the pictures that you are
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
seeing some of the parents in New
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have posted that and have had
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
that removed you need to know that this
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
is not about objectionable material we
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
worked hard to get that bill passed it
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
many people oppose that are now throwing
 
01:41:10.490 --> 01:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
that up and saying well wait we can just
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
remove object well yeah you opposed it
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
when we were fighting for it years ago
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
and now you're right we can't replace it
 
01:41:20.209 --> 01:41:20.219 align:start position:0%
and it gives parents the opportunity to
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
keep their kids in that public school
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
but you're talking about child sexual
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
abuse with some of this material that's
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
what it qualifies as and what what
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
qualifies as pornography I've been told
 
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
you know it when you see it I mean come
 
01:41:38.209 --> 01:41:38.219 align:start position:0%
on I think we all know that if we took
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
our kids to the neighbor's house and
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
dropped them off and they came home and
 
01:41:43.370 --> 01:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
they said you know what my um good
 
01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
friend's father you know took me in a
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
private room and showed me these
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
pictures I think all of us some of these
 
01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
pictures we'd be going okay I need to
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%

foreign

01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.689 --> 01:42:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.699 --> 01:42:20.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.609 --> 01:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
um thank you chairman and members of the
 
01:42:22.619 --> 01:42:23.810 align:start position:0%
um thank you chairman and members of the
committee

01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Megan
 
01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
Tuttle I'm the president of Nea New
 
01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we represent over 17 000
 
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
Educators across the state in our K-12
 
01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
public schools and also a few higher ed
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
institutions I'm here to testify in
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to hospital 514 because this
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would insert the Department of
 
01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
Education and school boards into a
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
criminal adjudication process when
 
01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
that's not their role the Department of
 
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
Education should focus on supporting the
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
Educators who serve our students and
 
01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:53.219 align:start position:0%
stop trying to find ways to bring in
 
01:42:54.590 --> 01:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
some you know intimidation with
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed tactics like this moreover
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
the bill is confusing and we don't feel
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's really ready to become law
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
so a question we have is what's wrong
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
with the current process it's been in
 
01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
place for about 50 years why does the
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the department think that
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
school boards or the Department of
 
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
Education are better equipped than our
 
01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
courts to determine what meets the legal
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
threshold of obscenity
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
in section two of the bill the language
 
01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
adds the Department of Education to the
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement entities whose current
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
role is to initiate a preliminary
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
hearing regarding obscene material
 
01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
if I read the bill correctly the process
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
would no longer apply to K-12 schools so
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're not sure why the doe would need to
 
01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
be added to the agencies who could
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
initiate this process
 
01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
Section 3 of the bill would require
 
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
school boards to adopt a policy or
 
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
process for adjudicating whether
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%
material is obscene where does the
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
policy and School Board process fit
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
with the criminal process of prosecuting
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
obscenity if is this school board
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
process supposed to replace replace the
 
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
current preliminary hearing process done
 
01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
by the courts in most cases school
 
01:43:59.570 --> 01:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
boards wait for criminal investigations
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
to close before taking any action and
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
that's at the behest of law enforcement
 
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
this proposal would require the opposite
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
by having the school board and then the
 
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education make the
 
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
initial determination before law
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement would bring charges
 
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
so why would this process that could end
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
in prosecution be removed from the
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of law enforcement and be
 
01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
given ultimately to the State Board of
 
01:44:22.910 --> 01:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
Education to decide
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
Additionally the bill appears to create
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
a new standard for determining if if
 
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
material is obscene which is whether the
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
material is harmful to minors this is
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
not the long-standing criminal of Sanity
 
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
standard and as a standard its broad
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
suggest subjective excuse me and
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
nebulous as we heard earlier you know
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
what one family commissioner or School
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
Board thinks is harmful is not the same
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
necessarily as what another one thinks
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
is harmful so that's why we feel these
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
decisions really need to be left in the
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
courts to be examined with the statutory
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
definition relevant case law
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
finally what happens if the agencies
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
listed here have a differing opinion on
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
whether to initiate a hearing under this
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
legislation does one take precedent over
 
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
the other who's speaking for the state
 
01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
in such circumstances
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
the chief law enforcement department of
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
the state or is it one of its state
 
01:45:08.639 --> 01:45:09.950 align:start position:0%
the state or is it one of its state
agencies

01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
the process that this bill seems to set
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
up seems confusing it's subjective and
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we don't feel it's
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
an effective way to do what the current
 
01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
law was designed to do which is to
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
protect children from obscene materials
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
that would cause some harm
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
so thank you for considering the
 
01:45:27.490 --> 01:45:27.500 align:start position:0%
testimony just standing look at that
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
three minutes right can I just add in
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
hope you'll find it in experience a
 
01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
legislative thank you very much uh there
 
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
are questions from the committee
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you oh yes
 
01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you oh yes
represents

01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
I just once again based on your
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
testimony we read through this can I see
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
these as two different things and you're
 
01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
saying that the second section the new
 
01:45:57.290 --> 01:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
subdivision is replacing or putting in
 
01:45:59.090 --> 01:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
front of
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh the criminal
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
section and I see I don't see that and
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you can explain to me
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
because my reading of it is
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
the one is for their local school
 
01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
as just removing or keeping the material
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
no criminal anything or prosecution I'm
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
not seeing anything in there just a
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not the material should be
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
removed or restricted
 
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
and the first section has to do with our
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
criminal code and law and whatever
 
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
so I see these as two completely
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
different things and I'm not sure how
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
your or why you're conflating them thank
 
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question we're
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
putting them together because it's in
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
the same bill with a new subdivision
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the complaint policy in
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
the second part
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
we read it as taking the school out of
 
01:46:57.290 --> 01:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
the first part because it's crossed out
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
and then there we read it as putting in
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
a process or a policy in the second part
 
01:47:04.729 --> 01:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
which is fine to have the process policy
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
on you know where it could be going or
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
how a parent could come in and say they
 
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
didn't want the material for their child
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
but we don't think it should be ending
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
up there or the safe part of Education
 
01:47:16.609 --> 01:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
it'll be moving on to the next so if
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
they were two different things my
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
understanding and we can differ on how
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
we interpret this which I think is part
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the problem with the confusing for us
 
01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:29.219 align:start position:0%
is that it still is part of
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
the same piece
 
01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:34.669 align:start position:0%
the same piece
yes

01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
would you have the same problems if we
 
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
just put this one bill in as two
 
01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
separate bills
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
I would need to see it before I could
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
answer that same thing just divided
 
01:47:46.729 --> 01:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
between the first part which has to do
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:47:51.290 --> 01:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
the first part amends this the second
 
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
part talks about something completely
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
different if we just divided it right
 
01:47:59.570 --> 01:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
there would it be more clear what was it
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
could be are you yeah they could be
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions from the
 
01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:05.629 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions from the
committee

01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
now seeing thank you very much I'm

um

01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Mary Wilkie I'm from
 
01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.169 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Mary Wilkie I'm from
Concord

01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to oppose HB 514 there's a
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
number of issues with the bill and other
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
people have addressed quite a few of
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
them and I'm hoping others will get
 
01:48:40.729 --> 01:48:40.739 align:start position:0%
addressed later I wanted to focus um
 
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
just on my experience as a public school
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
teacher I taught in Concord school
 
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
district for 20 years and I had more
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
than a thousand students overall I
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
taught in four different schools
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
um one year I gave a homework assignment
 
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
to some of my fifth graders that
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
involved reading an article about
 
01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
dinosaurs and the next morning I got a
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
call from a mom saying that she had told
 
01:49:01.729 --> 01:49:01.739 align:start position:0%
her child not to read the article
 
01:49:04.370 --> 01:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
because um the notion that dinosaurs
 
01:49:06.169 --> 01:49:06.179 align:start position:0%
existed millions of years ago conflicted
 
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
with her religion
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
so I think too for telling me and I
 
01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
excused the child from the homework I
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
gave them a different assignment to do
 
01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
during independent reading that would
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
cover the same skill I was trying to get
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
at if a conversation was friendly and
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
respectful we worked it out no one
 
01:49:22.609 --> 01:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
suggested that nobody else get to read
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
about dinosaurs and I just felt like
 
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
that's the way usually situations work
 
01:49:33.169 --> 01:49:33.179 align:start position:0%
teachers and parents work together as a
 
01:49:35.209 --> 01:49:35.219 align:start position:0%
team they collaborate for the benefit of
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.739 --> 01:49:39.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:49:39.050 --> 01:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:42.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:45.070 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
you have a little button right there
 
01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
there you go that's good you might I'm
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.270 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
um

01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
so there's already a law that prevents
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
schools from providing obscene materials
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
but currently it allows
 
01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:02.770 align:start position:0%
but currently it allows
um

01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:02.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
because the law of defining obscenity is
 
01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:06.950 align:start position:0%
because the law of defining obscenity is
so

01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
um subjective
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
it the current bill allows schools and
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
libraries and museums to get a court
 
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
opinion before they're held liable for
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
presenting materials like that
 
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the HB 514 would take away that
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
protection for K-12 teachers so they're
 
01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
left knowing that they could face
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties if they don't if they
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
make a if they judge something
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
differently from the way a court might
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the future judge it
 
01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:40.189 align:start position:0%
in the future judge it
okay

01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why we just don't
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
leave it the way it is there's already
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
protection against the kind of materials
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
that some of the witnesses have referred
 
01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.109 align:start position:0%
that some of the witnesses have referred
to

01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
in general the definition of obscene
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
materials though it's not it's not just
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
anything that makes somebody feel
 
01:50:55.370 --> 01:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and I'm not I'm again I
 
01:50:58.010 --> 01:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
think those materials sounded obscene to
 
01:50:58.020 --> 01:50:58.729 align:start position:0%
think those materials sounded obscene to
me

01:50:58.729 --> 01:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
but what I worry about is people have
 
01:51:02.209 --> 01:51:02.219 align:start position:0%
different ideas what makes them
 
01:51:05.090 --> 01:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and uh the definition of
 
01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
obscene materials in the statute is very
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
is it it's materials Who quote
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
predominant appeal is to the brilliant
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
interest in sex that is an interest in
 
01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
lewdness and lascivious thoughts I don't
 
01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:21.179 align:start position:0%
think our our school teachers are out
 
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
there you know pushing those kinds of
 
01:51:25.609 --> 01:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
materials on kids if they're in some
 
01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
apps somewhere then that should be
 
01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
brought to that judicial proceeding and
 
01:51:32.450 --> 01:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
address is that my time yeah oh it goes
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
by so fast so
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to say okay two
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
more sentences sure
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
as a public school teacher that been so
 
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
many bills lately that kind of
 
01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
allude to ideas that are cast teachers
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
in a bad light as if we were all out
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
there pushing pornography on our kids as
 
01:51:55.010 --> 01:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
a teacher the best interest of my kids
 
01:51:57.530 --> 01:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
was what kept me awake at night I was
 
01:51:59.810 --> 01:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
not doing that and it kind of breaks my
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
heart to hear that people think that
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
public school teachers are doing things
 
01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
like that thank you very much thank you

01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:06.530 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 514
um

01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
just we disagree with the sponsor of the
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
bill we see that it is indeed going to
 
01:53:15.649 --> 01:53:15.659 align:start position:0%
lead to book Banning and material being
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
removed from public schools and
 
01:53:19.629 --> 01:53:19.639 align:start position:0%
potentially public universities
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
I am not going to go over everything
 
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
that's been testified to before but
 
01:53:29.209 --> 01:53:29.219 align:start position:0%
we are clear that our Public School
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
boards have in place
 
01:53:33.649 --> 01:53:33.659 align:start position:0%
procedures for
 
01:53:33.659 --> 01:53:34.790 align:start position:0%
procedures for
um

01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
for parents who object to material to
 
01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:40.609 align:start position:0%
for parents who object to material to
um

01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:40.619 --> 01:53:42.590 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:53:42.590 --> 01:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
um you know raise their objections to
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
them parents have the right to raise
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
objections to materials to challenge
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
those materials and there's already
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
processing places for that we don't need
 
01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
a separate law for it
 
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
but what we don't want is for one parent
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
who objects to a a book in the library
 
01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:04.139 align:start position:0%
or in the classroom to be able to decide
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
for all children in that school what
 
01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
your child is able to read
 
01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
um you know representative luno said it
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
very well earlier that you can't decide
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
what my child can read
 
01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:18.410 align:start position:0%
what my child can read
um

01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:20.390 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
we are we are in favor of creating
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
good readers and in order for kids to be
 
01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
good readers they need to have books so
 
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
we are in favor of getting books in kids
 
01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
hands as a matter of fact aft is uh in
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
the midst of a reading opens the world
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
effort and we've given out over a
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
million books two kids and parents at
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
community events across the country
 
01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
including three aft New Hampshire locals
 
01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
where we've given out 8 000 books so
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to ban books we're
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
out there giving out books at community
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
events so this really goes against what
 
01:55:01.729 --> 01:55:01.739 align:start position:0%
we are all about which is making sure
 
01:55:04.129 --> 01:55:04.139 align:start position:0%
that kids have plenty of books to read
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
and are exposed to you know the whole
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
world through Reading now another part
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill that we have concerns about
 
01:55:13.209 --> 01:55:13.219 align:start position:0%
is where
 
01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:15.719 align:start position:0%
in revising
 
01:55:15.719 --> 01:55:16.430 align:start position:0%
in revising
um

01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:19.609 --> 01:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
Who falls under the obscene materials
 
01:55:21.169 --> 01:55:21.179 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
uh public universities that now exposes
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
the universities to the criminal
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
litigation if material is deemed to see
 
01:55:36.169 --> 01:55:36.179 align:start position:0%
obscene so previously they weren't
 
01:55:38.689 --> 01:55:38.699 align:start position:0%
mentioned and now you are going to
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
potentially limit
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
what adults can have access to at
 
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.890 align:start position:0%
what adults can have access to at
universities

01:55:45.890 --> 01:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
universities
 
01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
I do have my testimony to give you today
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
I have it cool thank you very much are
 
01:55:58.189 --> 01:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative parano thank you Mr
 
01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
question I'm confused I keep hearing
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
this mentioned over and over again that
 
01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
we don't want one parent
 
01:56:12.530 --> 01:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
making a decision for all of the rest of
 
01:56:15.050 --> 01:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
the students but we all know sometimes
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
it takes one person to make a group
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
aware of what's going on so I'm just
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
curious how many parents would it take
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
so that one parent should bring their
 
01:56:29.209 --> 01:56:29.219 align:start position:0%
concerns to well first the the teacher
 
01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
would be the place to start because it
 
01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
works best when parents and teachers
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
work as a team for the individual child
 
01:56:38.169 --> 01:56:38.179 align:start position:0%
but then you know there there is
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
following the command you will go to the
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
principal and the school board you have
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
a community to work in if enough of the
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
community agrees then you would
 
01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
reconsider that material
 
01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
I mean we've got that process in place
 
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
we've already got those kind of policies
 
01:56:58.129 --> 01:56:58.139 align:start position:0%
if you find something that
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
you think is inappropriate and
 
01:57:01.490 --> 01:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative page I don't be still in
 
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
the room describe that in in very good
 
01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:08.030 align:start position:0%
the room describe that in in very good
detail

01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:10.330 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:57:10.330 --> 01:57:10.340 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
it also can seem to keep hearing the
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
assumption that this is material that's
 
01:57:17.689 --> 01:57:17.699 align:start position:0%
being presented in the classroom but it
 
01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
also sounds to me like this material
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
might be just available in the library
 
01:57:23.330 --> 01:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
how would parents go about approaching
 
01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:24.250 align:start position:0%
how would parents go about approaching
that

01:57:24.250 --> 01:57:24.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
no one is forcing your student to take
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
out a particular library book
 
01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
library books are not assigned so those
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
are choices and and I'm always hearing
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
that we need to give students more
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
choices so you uh if there's a
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
particular topic or book you don't want
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
your student reading that's a place to
 
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
actually proactively have a conversation
 
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
about hey
 
01:57:58.669 --> 01:57:58.679 align:start position:0%
I don't want my child taking this book
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
out so that's that's another place where
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
teamwork really needs to come in if
 
01:58:04.129 --> 01:58:04.139 align:start position:0%
that's something you don't want your
 
01:58:07.970 --> 01:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
child having then please speak up we
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
would really rather not have an Irate
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
parent saying oh my goodness my child
 
01:58:14.689 --> 01:58:14.699 align:start position:0%
brought home this book and I'm horrified
 
01:58:14.699 --> 01:58:15.649 align:start position:0%
brought home this book and I'm horrified
um

01:58:15.649 --> 01:58:15.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:18.890 --> 01:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
yeah but again taking away something
 
01:58:21.649 --> 01:58:21.659 align:start position:0%
that another parent thinks is a valuable
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
resource and again I'm not going to
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
address the particular items those those
 
01:58:28.970 --> 01:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
parents brought because I I haven't seen
 
01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
them I mean so I I it would not be fair
 
01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:34.910 align:start position:0%
them I mean so I I it would not be fair
um but

01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:58:37.729 --> 01:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
it's not something that one person
 
01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
should decide for everyone because these
 
01:58:41.810 --> 01:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
are public schools for the whole
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
Community not for just your family
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
 
01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.010 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
representative

01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm also confused and I'm hoping you
 
01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
will enlighten me you were talking about
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
how this opens up higher education but
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
the first part are those who were
 
01:59:04.609 --> 01:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
Exempted from the obscene matter and
 
01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
before it just said educational and
 
01:59:11.930 --> 01:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
higher education was put in as Exempted
 
01:59:14.649 --> 01:59:14.659 align:start position:0%
specifically because they're adults
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
and and what they're what's not being
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
Exempted is
 
01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
um minor education of minors but the and
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm confused how how by exempting
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
them you open them up
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
they are opened up once the material is
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
deemed to be obscene
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
to further prosecution or further legal
 
01:59:47.709 --> 01:59:47.719 align:start position:0%
action if they continue to display
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
disseminate or
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
um you know otherwise circulate the
 
01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:53.330 align:start position:0%
um you know otherwise circulate the
material

01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
material
 
01:59:56.330 --> 01:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
and if you look into the upside ID
 
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
statute which uh representative David
 
02:00:00.290 --> 02:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier
 
02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:01.370 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier
um

02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
if it's gone through that adversarial
 
02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:05.689 align:start position:0%
if it's gone through that adversarial
hearing

02:00:05.689 --> 02:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
uh and has been found
 
02:00:08.699 --> 02:00:10.189 align:start position:0%
uh and has been found
to

02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
you know not have the
 
02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:14.930 align:start position:0%
you know not have the
um

02:00:14.930 --> 02:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
you know found to be obscene and not
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
have any
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
um redeeming value which is a very
 
02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:21.830 align:start position:0%
um redeeming value which is a very
subjective

02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:24.410 align:start position:0%
subjective
definition

02:00:24.410 --> 02:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
definition
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
what has educational value to one person
 
02:00:29.450 --> 02:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
might not have educational value to
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
another person so you're getting into a
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat squishy area
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
then you have indeed open those people
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
up to
 
02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:39.490 align:start position:0%
up to
um

02:00:39.490 --> 02:00:39.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:45.490 --> 02:00:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's the answer I've got so a
 
02:00:49.729 --> 02:00:49.739 align:start position:0%
follow-up is I'm going to uh get you
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
more of an answer yeah so you can keep
 
02:00:53.689 --> 02:00:53.699 align:start position:0%
asking I would suggest that on the side
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
you talk that without ripping electives
 
02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh are there other questions from the
 
02:01:01.330 --> 02:01:01.340 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing thank you very much
 
02:01:04.729 --> 02:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
Alora L Azam
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh Heather Raymond
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
did you look at this section right here
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
it says they shall not be okay so how
 
02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
does that thank you committee and um rep
 
02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
cordelli let me know that I should come
 
02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
rep in front so that everyone knows that
 
02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:26.219 align:start position:0%
so my name is Heather Raymond I am the
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative for Hillsboro District
 
02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
Five in Nashua I'm also the chair of the
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
policy committee on the national board
 
02:01:36.649 --> 02:01:36.659 align:start position:0%
of education I have over 15 years
 
02:01:39.530 --> 02:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
experience as a child and family social
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
worker including five years as a
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
forensic interviewer for the New York
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
State Police which makes me a little bit
 
02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
of an expert in child abuse specifically
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse of children so I noticed
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
that there was some testimony about that
 
02:01:54.169 --> 02:01:54.179 align:start position:0%
earlier today I'm not going to touch on
 
02:01:56.890 --> 02:01:56.900 align:start position:0%
that because it's something different
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
some previous speakers have said a lot
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
of my prepared remarks um so I just want
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
to highlight a couple of things
 
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
um first policy ige based on RSA 186
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
119c which is the parental objections to
 
02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
specific course materials covers any
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
objection that any particular parent has
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
about material that they don't want
 
02:02:24.370 --> 02:02:24.380 align:start position:0%
their child being exposed to the second
 
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
policy that I want to bring to the
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
attention of the committee and I know
 
02:02:32.089 --> 02:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
that Mr Christina had referred to it is
 
02:02:35.209 --> 02:02:35.219 align:start position:0%
policy ilja which is the removal of
 
02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
media center materials which lays out a
 
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
process by which any local school
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
district can remove items from their
 
02:02:45.649 --> 02:02:45.659 align:start position:0%
media centers which typically is because
 
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
they're old or out of date or falling
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
apart but also can be used for other
 
02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:51.589 align:start position:0%
apart but also can be used for other
reasons

02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to read a statement from the
 
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
American Library Association
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
and the statement is the unprecedented
 
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
number of challenges we're seeing
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
already this year reflects coordinated
 
02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
National efforts to silence marginalized
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
or historically underrepresented voices
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
and deprive all of us young people in
 
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
particular of the choice to explore a
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
world beyond the confines of personal
 
02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:16.209 align:start position:0%
world beyond the confines of personal
experience

02:03:16.209 --> 02:03:16.219 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
Librarians develop Collections and
 
02:03:21.169 --> 02:03:21.179 align:start position:0%
resources that make knowledge and ideas
 
02:03:24.169 --> 02:03:24.179 align:start position:0%
widely available so people and families
 
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
are free to choose what to read
 
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
though it is natural that we want to
 
02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
protect young people from some of life's
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
more difficult realities the truth is
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
that banning books does nothing to
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
protect them from dealing with tough
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
issues instead it denies young people
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
resources that can help them deal with
 
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
the challenges that confront them
 
02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
and just a couple more things from the
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
American Library Association 40 percent
 
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
of the books that were requested to be
 
02:03:56.689 --> 02:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
removed in 2022 were regarding lgbtq
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
Plus student subjects or by authors that
 
02:04:04.250 --> 02:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
are lgbtq plus another 40 of books that
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
were requested to be removed in 2022 had
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
main characters of color or were written
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
by individuals of color
 
02:04:14.570 --> 02:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
so I know this is New Hampshire we are
 
02:04:17.089 --> 02:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
not a diverse State Nashua is the most
 
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
diverse of all of the cities in New
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our diversity is low about
 
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
half of our kids are non-white or
 
02:04:27.890 --> 02:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
partially non-white it is very important
 
02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
to me as a member of the board of
 
02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
education but also as a parent and a
 
02:04:34.490 --> 02:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
representative of my community to ensure
 
02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
that we do not pass any type of state
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
law that would marginalize or silence
 
02:04:43.089 --> 02:04:43.099 align:start position:0%
the voices of the people in my community
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
kids deserve to read books about others
 
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
that look and experience things like
 
02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:50.570 align:start position:0%
that look and experience things like
them

02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:04:53.689 --> 02:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
thank you are either way willing to take
 
02:04:53.699 --> 02:04:55.430 align:start position:0%
thank you are either way willing to take
questions

02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
not seeing you thank you very much thank
 
02:05:12.070 --> 02:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you good morning
 
02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you citizen legislators we know
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
how hard you work my name is Bruce Burke
 
02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
I live in Pittsfield I'm a retired
 
02:05:26.330 --> 02:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
teacher of about 40 years uh so many
 
02:05:27.410 --> 02:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
things have been brought up this morning
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to uh go in a different
 
02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
direction I think but I am talking about
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I've done in
 
02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
retirement is I'm in my coaching my
 
02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
fourth year on a casa case I have three
 
02:05:44.810 --> 02:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
children uh two of them have IEPs one of
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
them has a 504 and uh maybe 10 days ago
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
we just had a meeting about this child's
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
504 myself the foster mom the principal
 
02:05:58.609 --> 02:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
the teacher three specialists
 
02:06:00.589 --> 02:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
I am talking about this bill please
 
02:06:02.770 --> 02:06:02.780 align:start position:0%
don't think that I'm losing track here
 
02:06:04.729 --> 02:06:04.739 align:start position:0%
tremendous effort
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
tremendous effort put into one child
 
02:06:10.609 --> 02:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
and when I asked the Foster Mother after
 
02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
the meeting if there were other kids in
 
02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
the class like her foster daughter she
 
02:06:16.910 --> 02:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
said there are at least four more
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
and the point that I'm trying to make is
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
our teachers are working incredibly hard
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
they're exhausted I would say they're
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed by the last two or three
 
02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:27.290 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed by the last two or three
years

02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:06:30.050 --> 02:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
and it feels like
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps for good intention but it feels
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
like to me that we continue to have a
 
02:06:36.830 --> 02:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
series of bills that come before this
 
02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:37.910 align:start position:0%
series of bills that come before this
committee

02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:06:41.930 --> 02:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
that say we do not value teachers we
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
don't trust teachers
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
and so when I look at this bill and I
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
read it in the process makes some sense
 
02:06:52.729 --> 02:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
to me I think what we're doing again
 
02:06:55.729 --> 02:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
is we are jeopardizing the future of
 
02:06:57.770 --> 02:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
teaching in New Hampshire because who's
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
going to come look for a job in this
 
02:07:00.239 --> 02:07:01.729 align:start position:0%
going to come look for a job in this
state

02:07:01.729 --> 02:07:01.739 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
if this bill becomes law
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
on top of a decisive you know decisive
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
language bill on top of perhaps a
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
loyalty oath bill
 
02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
what happens to young people looking to
 
02:07:16.129 --> 02:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
become Educators I'm afraid they're not
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to come to New Hampshire and I
 
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
think we already know there's a teaching
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
crisis in New Hampshire in terms of
 
02:07:23.810 --> 02:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
Staffing thank you thank you very much
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:29.219 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher thank you Mr
 
02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you for that testimony I
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify are you
 
02:07:35.209 --> 02:07:35.219 align:start position:0%
suggesting that if we were to prohibit
 
02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
as this bill were to say obscene books
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the classroom and prohibit the
 
02:07:42.770 --> 02:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
teaching of critical race theory that
 
02:07:44.570 --> 02:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
teachers being trained in teachers
 
02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
colleges would choose not to come and
 
02:07:48.109 --> 02:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
teach in this state I think what I'm
 
02:07:50.330 --> 02:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say is I I don't want
 
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
to intimidate young people who are
 
02:07:57.770 --> 02:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
pursuing a career in education
 
02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to take too much time
 
02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
because of discuss I mean obscenity I I
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
we could disagree around the margins I
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
think most of us can agree on what's
 
02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:07.550 align:start position:0%
think most of us can agree on what's
obscene

02:08:07.550 --> 02:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
obscene
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
right but what I what I'm trying to say
 
02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
here is if we put too many roadblocks to
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
our to to teachers
 
02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
they aren't going to stay in the
 
02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:18.169 align:start position:0%
they aren't going to stay in the
profession

02:08:18.169 --> 02:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
profession
 
02:08:21.050 --> 02:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
it just becomes uh discouraging for them
 
02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:22.790 align:start position:0%
it just becomes uh discouraging for them
uh

02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:24.770 --> 02:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
not to be redundant I mean these people
 
02:08:26.570 --> 02:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
I met with last week they're exhausted
 
02:08:30.589 --> 02:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with this child and other
 
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
children and so
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
really I think we should be talking
 
02:08:37.550 --> 02:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
about pay increases and how do we
 
02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
recognize teachers but that's a
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
different subject for a different day
 
02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
another important subject though further
 
02:08:48.070 --> 02:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
further questions we is no no
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative yeah yeah go ahead do you
 
02:08:51.599 --> 02:08:52.430 align:start position:0%
representative yeah yeah go ahead do you
think

02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
um that it's not only
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
bills like this but the fact that they
 
02:08:57.890 --> 02:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
carry criminalization and felony
 
02:09:00.109 --> 02:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
convictions that probably
 
02:09:03.530 --> 02:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
chill the teacher into even coming close
 
02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
to the borderlines or and experimenting
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
with anything so I read the bill twice I
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
think I understand it then I thought I
 
02:09:12.649 --> 02:09:12.659 align:start position:0%
heard a different interpretation over
 
02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
here earlier but as I read the bill I
 
02:09:18.530 --> 02:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
thought that there was after process uh
 
02:09:20.450 --> 02:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
perhaps criminalization involved I think
 
02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:22.139 align:start position:0%
that would be chilling and if I'm in a
 
02:09:22.139 --> 02:09:23.330 align:start position:0%
that would be chilling and if I'm in a
faculty

02:09:23.330 --> 02:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
faculty
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
where a colleague has been brought up to
 
02:09:29.089 --> 02:09:29.099 align:start position:0%
trial whether there was a guilty plea or
 
02:09:29.099 --> 02:09:32.330 align:start position:0%
trial whether there was a guilty plea or
not

02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.089 --> 02:09:38.099 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Belgium thank you
 
02:09:39.770 --> 02:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
very brief thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
for the testimony again I just
 
02:09:46.370 --> 02:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
I I understand the the issue around
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
um a criminal penalty but to draw
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
contrast if somebody were to
 
02:09:55.550 --> 02:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
walk up to a child at a playground and
 
02:09:57.169 --> 02:09:57.179 align:start position:0%
show them the content that is in some of
 
02:09:59.390 --> 02:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
these books could they possibly expect
 
02:10:03.370 --> 02:10:03.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
you want me to put on my Police hat now
 
02:10:09.530 --> 02:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
look at I here's where I'm not going to
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
disagree with you I
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
as a parent as a former educator as you
 
02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
know I think a pretty normal human being
 
02:10:18.490 --> 02:10:18.500 align:start position:0%
we have to be careful about
 
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
what we there are things that obviously
 
02:10:24.649 --> 02:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
that our kids should not be seeing I
 
02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
guess I deferred to the comments earlier
 
02:10:28.370 --> 02:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
in the day I think the school boards and
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
the principals and the teachers we have
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
to trust them to make the right decision
 
02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
if there's a one percent of who aren't
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
then I you know I think they're ways to
 
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
go after that
 
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:10:54.129 --> 02:10:54.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.689 --> 02:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for joining me my name
 
02:10:58.970 --> 02:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
is Joseph Marquette I am a teacher in
 
02:11:00.649 --> 02:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm a teacher back in New
 
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire after I didn't teach in New
 
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 10 years because of the
 
02:11:04.609 --> 02:11:04.619 align:start position:0%
homophobia that was alive in New
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I didn't get my career here
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
but then I left but then I came back
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire was trying to
 
02:11:10.669 --> 02:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
figure itself out a little bit and
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
showing some human decency to human
 
02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
beings I don't have anything prepared
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
per se because I came here to be
 
02:11:20.089 --> 02:11:20.099 align:start position:0%
available to you so just for clarity
 
02:11:22.129 --> 02:11:22.139 align:start position:0%
um talk about teachers getting paid I
 
02:11:24.290 --> 02:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
get a bonus if I don't take my personal
 
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
days but what happened to me as a gay
 
02:11:31.010 --> 02:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
child was horrible horrible
 
02:11:33.169 --> 02:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
and I will stay here with you as long as
 
02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
you would like because I fought for my
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
marriage in these buildings I've been
 
02:11:39.169 --> 02:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
put to shame in front of people publicly
 
02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
in this state so much in my life that if
 
02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
you want to sit here I'll cry I'm gonna
 
02:11:46.010 --> 02:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
be kind of gross it's okay
 
02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
but I'm here to fight for kids because
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
nobody fought for me
 
02:11:53.629 --> 02:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
nobody gave me information
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
the lack of that information led to a
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
story that's worthy of a bad movie I
 
02:12:00.129 --> 02:12:00.139 align:start position:0%
would never want to see
 
02:12:03.169 --> 02:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
I show up every day
 
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
I am working on my third graduate
 
02:12:08.689 --> 02:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
qualification I hope for Teacher
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
certifications I'm qualified for two
 
02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
more my student during covid was the
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
only American student that was permitted
 
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
or as how do you say in English and
 
02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
entered into the most prestigious Latin
 
02:12:25.129 --> 02:12:25.139 align:start position:0%
immersion program in Europe the full
 
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
scholarship all expenses paid through
 
02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:30.169 align:start position:0%
scholarship all expenses paid through
covet

02:12:30.169 --> 02:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
covet
 
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
I bring quality to the school every
 
02:12:34.970 --> 02:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
single day I'm meeting 14 teachers
 
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
through a master's program after they
 
02:12:40.129 --> 02:12:40.139 align:start position:0%
work all day one of them is our
 
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
librarian who's covering my class right
 
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
now because she is afraid to come here
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
again I've been beaten up by this state
 
02:12:48.550 --> 02:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
so much I can just come and take it
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
she's afraid she's a mama
 
02:12:55.609 --> 02:12:55.619 align:start position:0%
she's being harassed
 
02:12:57.770 --> 02:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
and that's not okay
 
02:13:00.010 --> 02:13:00.020 align:start position:0%
but something we not be thinking about
 
02:13:03.410 --> 02:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
is that the kids know this is happening
 
02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
they know you're throwing them around
 
02:13:07.069 --> 02:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
they know you're debating them they're
 
02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
hoping that some of you are kind
 
02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
but they know that they're also
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
homophobes what is happening here is a
 
02:13:16.729 --> 02:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
cultural process that's part of my
 
02:13:20.089 --> 02:13:20.099 align:start position:0%
scholarship my first graduate degree is
 
02:13:22.189 --> 02:13:22.199 align:start position:0%

out whether or not I was going to hell
 
02:13:37.250 --> 02:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
because of the religious abuse I was
 
02:13:39.290 --> 02:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
raised in in Barrington New Hampshire by
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
a community of people who thought that
 
02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
they should raise children without any
 
02:13:45.649 --> 02:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
access to the world
 
02:13:49.250 --> 02:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
so homosexuality was a quote send the
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
cried out to heaven for punishment
 
02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
I was 14 years old sneaking into my
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
church library which was the only place
 
02:13:59.169 --> 02:13:59.179 align:start position:0%
I had access to books
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
looking for something to find out as a
 
02:14:03.950 --> 02:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
14 year old healthy young man whether or
 
02:14:05.569 --> 02:14:05.579 align:start position:0%

02:14:15.550 --> 02:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:19.609 --> 02:14:19.619 align:start position:0%
what I learned terrorized me
 
02:14:23.089 --> 02:14:23.099 align:start position:0%
it also meant that I was not protected
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
again we don't have time and and I'm not
 
02:14:26.930 --> 02:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
really well prepared because I just
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
decided to do this this morning and I
 
02:14:31.370 --> 02:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
gave up my my who cares all right
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
teachers reported began with but I'm
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
here for you
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that I'm not presenting well I
 
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
have to fit all of my PTSD trauma
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
but if you would like to ask me
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions about what's going on and what
 
02:14:48.649 --> 02:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
you're feeling because people are
 
02:14:49.729 --> 02:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
putting right now I'm thinking there's
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
lots of emotions that's called formal
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
cultural response it makes you feel
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
formal cultural response it's part of
 
02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
being a human being
 
02:15:03.649 --> 02:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
your funnel cultural response is yours
 
02:15:07.129 --> 02:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
I'm the world's biggest food
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
I was going to be a priest
 
02:15:12.530 --> 02:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
I just stopped watching I'm just our
 
02:15:14.930 --> 02:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
20th year anniversary the same on demand

was this thing on Netflix with my
 
02:15:20.350 --> 02:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
that is my choice
 
02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
I was six children in Portsmouth
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
they were safe because of the
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
professionals Imports but we kept them
 
02:15:34.729 --> 02:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
safe excuse me the time has his time I'm
 
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
sorry so uh are there any questions from
 
02:15:39.229 --> 02:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
nothing thank you very much
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you for that
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's awesome I just I I know that you
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
said your first graduate degree was in
 
02:15:49.729 --> 02:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
queer theory yes is that something you
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
would Advocate teaching in in uh
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
um earlier grades such as high school
 
02:15:57.709 --> 02:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
elementary school or middle school but
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
so most people don't even know what
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
queer theory is like most people don't
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
know what socialism is like most people
 
02:16:05.089 --> 02:16:05.099 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna you know that's right
 
02:16:07.250 --> 02:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
here oh sure yes this is a bill that's
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with a different topic than that
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
question so I'm going to disallow the
 
02:16:16.490 --> 02:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
question okay are there any other uh
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee that's yes
 
02:16:20.810 --> 02:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking me a question thank
 
02:16:25.490 --> 02:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you were a parent
 
02:16:29.390 --> 02:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
to Children Here in New Hampshire yes
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
and the prime sponsor when he introduced
 
02:16:34.310 --> 02:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
this bill he said his intent was not to
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
ban books actually his intent was to
 
02:16:37.969 --> 02:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
give rights to parents so I'd love to
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
know if you could direct me to a point
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
within the bill where it would take away
 
02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
your rights as a parent as you said to
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
um if you chose your children didn't
 
02:16:50.209 --> 02:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
want to view a certain material wearing
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
here this would prevent you from doing
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
that I would see this bill as giving
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
more rights to parents I understood the
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
bill is giving rights to parents to try
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
to remove books such that they're not
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
available to the children of other
 
02:17:04.910 --> 02:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
parents who want their children to have
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
access to books
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
I also know that as a parent and as a
 
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
child in New Hampshire that there were
 
02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
standards in my family and that those
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
families that those standards selected
 
02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
what I read active parenting takes care
 
02:17:20.929 --> 02:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
of this issue
 
02:17:23.650 --> 02:17:23.660 align:start position:0%
that is what active printing is for
 
02:17:27.549 --> 02:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing when we allow
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
reading material that is vetted by
 
02:17:32.810 --> 02:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
professionals nationally who work very
 
02:17:36.530 --> 02:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
hard in Board review to be able to okay
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
attain the qualifications that would
 
02:17:40.849 --> 02:17:40.859 align:start position:0%
which is what the Librarians do they
 
02:17:43.310 --> 02:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
have entire data networks and then they
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
read all of the reviews that are put
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
forward by professionals when we have
 
02:17:50.570 --> 02:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
that available to children they are made
 
02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:51.589 align:start position:0%
that available to children they are made
safe

02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
safe
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
now children who don't want to read a
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
book because they do not feel that need
 
02:17:58.969 --> 02:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
psychologically they open the first page
 
02:18:00.650 --> 02:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
they go yeah not for me and they put it
 
02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:01.490 align:start position:0%
they go yeah not for me and they put it
down

02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:04.019 align:start position:0%
and isn't that child perhaps lucky you
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
know who knows maybe the bill has to do
 
02:18:07.849 --> 02:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
with abuse unless you to the bill the
 
02:18:07.859 --> 02:18:10.190 align:start position:0%
with abuse unless you to the bill the
book

02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:12.530 --> 02:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
but for the child who needs to know that
 
02:18:14.750 --> 02:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's a word for something
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
and then needs to know how to be safe
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
that book can save a life
 
02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
when we take away children's ability to
 
02:18:28.009 --> 02:18:28.019 align:start position:0%
read books or parents trust in schools
 
02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
that those things are there that they
 
02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:30.469 align:start position:0%
that those things are there that they
need

02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
we limit the processes of our democracy
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
may I ask a follow-up please no we're
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%

Education as far as through a workshop
 
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
and stuff and some of the stuff that's
 
02:19:30.349 --> 02:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
coming up today is a process as far as
 
02:19:33.410 --> 02:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
how a parent goes about bringing a
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
complaint and I think that's one thing
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
that this bill and I am supporting this
 
02:19:39.709 --> 02:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
bill actually does it brings a standard
 
02:19:43.129 --> 02:19:43.139 align:start position:0%
as to a complaint in how the appeal
 
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
would go so I think having that stand at
 
02:19:47.330 --> 02:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
Statewide is a good thing
 
02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:48.950 align:start position:0%
Statewide is a good thing
the

02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
another representative brought up the
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
challenge as far as the uh one of the
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me for a second
 
02:19:59.570 --> 02:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
the American Library Association uh
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
complaints about 1597 books uh I do have
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
the top 10 challenge books right here
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to show it uh it is
 
02:20:10.969 --> 02:20:10.979 align:start position:0%
anyways I do have it here someone does
 
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
want it point I'm making here is
 
02:20:16.490 --> 02:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
those Works have been challenged and
 
02:20:18.889 --> 02:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
then he said there was even more in 22.
 
02:20:21.410 --> 02:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
and the problem is
 
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
we the people are finding problems
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
within the school and probably most
 
02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
likely the school library is more than
 
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
the actual uh classroom itself so the
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
libraries themselves I don't know if
 
02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
they have a mission statement but if
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
they do they should be really honing
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
that mission statement to the core
 
02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
subject of this for the students to
 
02:20:44.450 --> 02:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
learn even more all right at that point
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody's really trying to
 
02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
ban books these the kids the kids can
 
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
actually go to local libraries or
 
02:20:57.410 --> 02:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
outside or at home and search these up
 
02:20:58.730 --> 02:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
if that's what they want to do on the
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
Internet or even order them on Amazon if
 
02:21:03.770 --> 02:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
that's the point if they want to so as
 
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
far as the school goes they want to make
 
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
sure it's age appropriate in a lot of
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
cases it is not and that's part of the
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
problem what might be good for our 12th
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
grader is not good for a ninth grader
 
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
all right well our ninth grade is not
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
good for a seventh grader so and that's
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
what's happening in our school so
 
02:21:21.650 --> 02:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
all right I'll take any questions if you
 
02:21:22.610 --> 02:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
have any thank you very much
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:28.550 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
how many of those communities that you
 
02:21:33.650 --> 02:21:33.660 align:start position:0%
represent have libraries outside of the
 
02:21:33.660 --> 02:21:36.950 align:start position:0%
represent have libraries outside of the
school

02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
uh I would absolutely say at least two
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
no probably three or four at least
 
02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
at least uh Enfield I'm sure does have
 
02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
one I know Bristol absolutely has one
 
02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
and I would think Alexandria was
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
probably another if not Bridgewater and
 
02:21:58.610 --> 02:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:01.800 align:start position:0%

Specialists

02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
Specialists
 
02:33:58.969 --> 02:33:58.979 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this a little bit
 
02:34:02.290 --> 02:34:02.300 align:start position:0%
um in Prior days
 
02:34:06.530 --> 02:34:06.540 align:start position:0%
reading specialist is in statute now but
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
it is related to Contract Services for a
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
reading specialists this just opens it
 
02:34:15.950 --> 02:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
up for this for the Department to employ
 
02:34:18.530 --> 02:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
a staff member who would be a reading
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
specialist so it's very simple it's
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
something requested by the department uh
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
because they do have someone who is
 
02:34:30.010 --> 02:34:30.020 align:start position:0%
serving in that role uh so the statutes
 
02:34:34.250 --> 02:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
should conform to uh practice thank you
 
02:34:37.010 --> 02:34:37.020 align:start position:0%

02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%

02:34:48.650 --> 02:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
maintain that contracted Services of a
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.410 --> 02:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
um who knows thank you for the question
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what's going to happen in
 
02:34:57.530 --> 02:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
the future so
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think it's
 
02:35:01.550 --> 02:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
um bad to leave it in there because it
 
02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
could be something needed in the future
 
02:35:05.450 --> 02:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't have to modify the
 
02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:10.490 --> 02:35:10.500 align:start position:0%

consultant position within the
 
02:36:14.090 --> 02:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
department that currently exists we were
 
02:36:17.389 --> 02:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
able to uh luckily hire somebody that
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%

to have her serve in that capacity and
 
02:36:29.570 --> 02:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of the RSA as
 
02:36:33.110 --> 02:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
stated earlier we do want the ability to
 
02:36:36.349 --> 02:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility of the unfortunate
 
02:36:38.330 --> 02:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
event happens that we no longer have
 
02:36:40.849 --> 02:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
that person on staff to be able to then
 
02:36:44.210 --> 02:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
contract out for those services
 
02:36:47.389 --> 02:36:47.399 align:start position:0%

02:37:00.250 --> 02:37:00.260 align:start position:0%
potential for that person to become
 
02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%

it's a staff position okay so with the
 
02:37:24.770 --> 02:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
bill add an additional staff position as
 
02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
a reading specialist no it would just
 
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
allow us to meet the requirements of the
 
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
RSA by having that person can serve in
 
02:37:33.469 --> 02:37:33.479 align:start position:0%

consultant position as a as a physician

be eliminated no it would just be that

those um responsibilities and duties
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%

name is Mel Myler and I represent uh

02:40:05.770 --> 02:40:05.780 align:start position:0%
lovely towns of Hopkinton and Bo
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
I would like to have you look at the
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and forget the original bill
 
02:40:14.809 --> 02:40:14.819 align:start position:0%
so I would like to I would like to move
 
02:40:17.330 --> 02:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the appropriate procedure
 
02:40:20.750 --> 02:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
is to move uh the amendment and I'll
 
02:40:22.610 --> 02:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
explain why you don't know you don't
 
02:40:24.290 --> 02:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
have to move it you can just talk about
 
02:40:25.610 --> 02:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
it because then we will do that when we
 
02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
get an exact session a bit of a wait do
 
02:40:30.250 --> 02:40:30.260 align:start position:0%
we have that Amendment
 
02:40:34.010 --> 02:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
oh okay yes a bit of a background for
 
02:40:38.929 --> 02:40:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:41.330 --> 02:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
you should have enough
 
02:40:44.330 --> 02:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
how many are we short
 
02:40:49.730 --> 02:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
well I'm probably about four four short
 
02:40:51.650 --> 02:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
okay I'll get those for you for then
 
02:40:53.290 --> 02:40:53.300 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
02:40:58.790 --> 02:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
just a bit of a background last year
 
02:41:02.690 --> 02:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
there was a uh work group that worked on
 
02:41:05.690 --> 02:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
the issue of teachers teacher shortage
 
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh the members of that committee uh was
 
02:41:11.150 --> 02:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
myself representing the lad represent
 
02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative Ford uh Senator Khan and
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward
 
02:41:19.490 --> 02:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan was the chair of that
 
02:41:23.809 --> 02:41:23.819 align:start position:0%
committee and we spent a time looking at
 
02:41:26.210 --> 02:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
the issue of teacher shortages within
 
02:41:27.170 --> 02:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
last year when we started the school
 
02:41:32.090 --> 02:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
year we discovered that there was
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
significant teacher shortages around the
 
02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:35.990 align:start position:0%
significant teacher shortages around the
state

02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
and we had various people come before us
 
02:41:41.690 --> 02:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
to talk about the need to do something
 
02:41:45.230 --> 02:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
about the teacher shortage
 
02:41:48.309 --> 02:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that this bill I
 
02:41:50.510 --> 02:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
presented this bill
 
02:41:54.170 --> 02:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
to try to adapt to address the issue of
 
02:41:57.969 --> 02:41:57.979 align:start position:0%
shortages primarily in a teacher
 
02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
certification areas as well as rural
 
02:42:03.170 --> 02:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
areas because that was a focus that we
 
02:42:04.969 --> 02:42:04.979 align:start position:0%
looked at in the committee
 
02:42:08.110 --> 02:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
and this is a loan forgiveness program
 
02:42:12.170 --> 02:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
that would allow teachers who work in
 
02:42:15.590 --> 02:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
identified teacher shortage areases as
 
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
well as rural areas to uh when they work
 
02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
in these areas a graduated way of
 
02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
re reimbursing loans that they might
 
02:42:29.210 --> 02:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
have had to get their teaching
 
02:42:32.270 --> 02:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
certificate you will note on the second
 
02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:33.650 align:start position:0%
certificate you will note on the second
page

02:42:33.650 --> 02:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
it talks about the uh the graduated
 
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
nature of the loan forgiveness so that
 
02:42:43.250 --> 02:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
if a teacher were to be working the
 
02:42:44.990 --> 02:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
first year they could get a fifteen
 
02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars uh twenty five hundred
 
02:42:49.370 --> 02:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
dollars up to four forty five hundred
 
02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
dollars or a total of twelve thousand
 
02:42:53.570 --> 02:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
dollars alone if that was their uh if
 
02:42:56.090 --> 02:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
that was their loan and it's important
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
to note that I did this in a way to try
 
02:43:02.270 --> 02:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that hopefully if if folks
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
are in these particular areas that are
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
identified by the Department of
 
02:43:09.469 --> 02:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
Education that they might stay there
 
02:43:12.170 --> 02:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
after being there for four years or five
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
years and uh to help uh significantly
 
02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
those that are underserved schools and
 
02:43:21.469 --> 02:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
Rural schools and those schools that are
 
02:43:25.370 --> 02:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
in short supply of teachers in the areas
 
02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:26.770 align:start position:0%
in short supply of teachers in the areas
of

02:43:26.770 --> 02:43:26.780 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:43:30.170 --> 02:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
Sciences math Etc and it should be noted
 
02:43:32.110 --> 02:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
that the department does identify
 
02:43:35.389 --> 02:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
shortage areas and they would be the
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
ones that would be able to uh
 
02:43:40.370 --> 02:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
significantly indicate for school
 
02:43:42.770 --> 02:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
districts that could then as they
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
recruit as they recruit new teachers
 
02:43:47.270 --> 02:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
they can say if you come to teach here
 
02:43:50.210 --> 02:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
for example you have this potential for
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
a loan reimbursement uh if they if they
 
02:43:55.730 --> 02:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
work in the school district weeks so
 
02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's really what this is all about and
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's a I will also say that there's a a
 
02:44:02.210 --> 02:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
similar bill that is working its way
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
through the Senate now that basically
 
02:44:06.410 --> 02:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
addresses the same issues that both
 
02:44:08.510 --> 02:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
representing Ford and representative lad
 
02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
and I worked on over the summer
 
02:44:13.370 --> 02:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
so that's that's basically the
 
02:44:16.190 --> 02:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
introduction of this and I will say that
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
the initial bill not that I want you to
 
02:44:20.990 --> 02:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
look at it but the initial bill was to
 
02:44:22.490 --> 02:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
have the loan forgiveness to come
 
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
through the university system and as I
 
02:44:25.969 --> 02:44:25.979 align:start position:0%
was talking with the university
 
02:44:27.790 --> 02:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives they said really it's
 
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're not they don't have the
 
02:44:32.809 --> 02:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
capability of doing this and further
 
02:44:35.090 --> 02:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
this really opens it up to many more
 
02:44:37.010 --> 02:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
students because it was primarily
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
focused original concept was focused on
 
02:44:43.730 --> 02:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
those individuals going through the UNH
 
02:44:47.450 --> 02:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
system this would allow teachers from
 
02:44:50.929 --> 02:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
any system any school that had a loan
 
02:44:52.610 --> 02:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
that would work in these primarily
 
02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
priority areas thank you very much thank
 
02:44:57.370 --> 02:44:57.380 align:start position:0%
you very much uh reverse
 
02:45:00.250 --> 02:45:00.260 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this question before
 
02:45:03.170 --> 02:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
you've got a tiered system for over the
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
four years uh for this incentive award
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
um what happens for the individual let's
 
02:45:13.010 --> 02:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
say that uh comes and takes a job from
 
02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
you graduate at UMass Lowell comes
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
across and is is and that's perfectly
 
02:45:21.410 --> 02:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
acceptable if they're working here but
 
02:45:24.050 --> 02:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
then they cut bait after one year and
 
02:45:25.730 --> 02:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
leave but they took their incentive
 
02:45:27.830 --> 02:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
grant for it should there be a time
 
02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
where you come in and stay uh for it and
 
02:45:34.070 --> 02:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
then you collect your you know the
 
02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
funding for your loan forget I know that
 
02:45:37.370 --> 02:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't help with interest and all that
 
02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
but maybe it would ensure that somebody
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
comes and stays in our state rather than
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
coming in you know them leaving well I
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
think that's always that's always a
 
02:45:48.530 --> 02:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
possibility to have with any employment
 
02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have indentured
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
servitude here uh trying to get people
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
just to stay here but I think this was
 
02:45:57.650 --> 02:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
just an attempt to try to meet the
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
initial needs of school districts that
 
02:46:02.349 --> 02:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
could use this as a recruitment process
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
for their uh vacancies yeah
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
further question represent perineal
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Miler for taking my
 
02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.130 align:start position:0%
representative Miler for taking my
question

02:46:13.130 --> 02:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:46:16.130 --> 02:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
um do we have any idea how many teachers
 
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
might be availing themselves of this
 
02:46:20.510 --> 02:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity I'm just trying to get an
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
idea of how many underserved what was
 
02:46:24.830 --> 02:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
the word
 
02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:26.690 align:start position:0%
the word
um

02:46:26.690 --> 02:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:30.349 --> 02:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh critical edu shortages we have thank
 
02:46:31.849 --> 02:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the questions uh very
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
good when we were dealing with this in
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
the summer time we did
 
02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
um a survey of of superintendents Etc
 
02:46:42.170 --> 02:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't have the numbers off
 
02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but there were
 
02:46:47.570 --> 02:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
significant numbers at that time of
 
02:46:49.250 --> 02:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
trying to recruit people to go into
 
02:46:51.770 --> 02:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
these specific areas that are mentioned
 
02:46:53.809 --> 02:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
in the bill so I'm sorry I don't have
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
the figure but believe me that that was
 
02:46:57.889 --> 02:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
a big deal when we started school
 
02:46:59.870 --> 02:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
because at many schools I did not have
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
teachers because of the the the short
 
02:47:04.130 --> 02:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
shortages and they weren't really filled
 
02:47:06.830 --> 02:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
until later into the uh fall of the Year
 
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for representative Lucas
 
02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:13.630 align:start position:0%
thank you for representative Lucas
foreign

02:47:13.630 --> 02:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:17.630 --> 02:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
on to previous comma and knowing what's
 
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
done a lot of times in Industry
 
02:47:25.610 --> 02:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
um would you be amenable to putting off
 
02:47:28.849 --> 02:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
this for a year or two before you start
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
paying back
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
to encourage teachers to actually to
 
02:47:36.190 --> 02:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
better encourage teachers to actually
 
02:47:40.450 --> 02:47:40.460 align:start position:0%
stay rather than this within four years
 
02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
all of the money has been paid off and
 
02:47:48.170 --> 02:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:50.809 --> 02:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
I'm not really thought about that it's a
 
02:47:53.090 --> 02:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
New Concept uh according to what
 
02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd said my basic
 
02:47:56.750 --> 02:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
concern was trying to meet the immediate
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
need that school districts were saying
 
02:48:00.410 --> 02:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
that they they needed to have it at the
 
02:48:04.750 --> 02:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chair thank you representative
 
02:48:12.650 --> 02:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
Myler I love this concept I've actually
 
02:48:15.170 --> 02:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
been asked for it by constituents who
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
teach in Claremont and that is District
 
02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
that frequently loses teachers to better
 
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
paying schools and in other geographies
 
02:48:25.849 --> 02:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
sometimes still in New Hampshire
 
02:48:28.730 --> 02:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
in your intro you commented about I
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
believe in the original version of the
 
02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:31.610 align:start position:0%
believe in the original version of the
bill

02:48:31.610 --> 02:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:32.570 align:start position:0%
bill
um

02:48:32.570 --> 02:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:35.389 --> 02:48:35.399 align:start position:0%
also having an incentive program for
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
teachers who teach in subject matter
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
areas where we have a critical shortage
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
and trying to read and listen at the
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
same time I may have missed it but I
 
02:48:45.290 --> 02:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
don't think that's in the amendment when
 
02:48:46.969 --> 02:48:46.979 align:start position:0%
you look at critical shortages it would
 
02:48:50.270 --> 02:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
be both for Rural and those highly
 
02:48:52.690 --> 02:48:52.700 align:start position:0%
highly needed
 
02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
subject matters I mean we've talked
 
02:48:59.210 --> 02:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
about science math there are the others
 
02:49:01.550 --> 02:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
that we've special education right
 
02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
special technology writing technology to
 
02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
him so that is included here yeah and it
 
02:49:08.750 --> 02:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
that it should be I mean I think it is
 
02:49:10.910 --> 02:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
because these the Department of
 
02:49:13.969 --> 02:49:13.979 align:start position:0%
Education basically identifies those
 
02:49:17.570 --> 02:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
High need areas and this would would be
 
02:49:19.550 --> 02:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
focused on those High need areas as well
 
02:49:21.590 --> 02:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
as the rural issue too
 
02:49:24.050 --> 02:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
and they and underperforming schools is
 
02:49:25.929 --> 02:49:25.939 align:start position:0%
another issue here and the the
 
02:49:28.849 --> 02:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
department also in the indicates which
 
02:49:30.889 --> 02:49:30.899 align:start position:0%
those are under underperforming schools
 
02:49:33.230 --> 02:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
too so it's the high need areas that
 
02:49:34.309 --> 02:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
we're really we're looking that's the
 
02:49:36.469 --> 02:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill
 
02:49:36.479 --> 02:49:37.969 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill
representative

02:49:37.969 --> 02:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
no representative uh Ford and then
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:49:49.790 --> 02:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question have you become aware
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
of since our committee meetings before
 
02:49:53.929 --> 02:49:53.939 align:start position:0%
in which we went through these things
 
02:49:57.530 --> 02:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
that there has developed a motion to
 
02:50:00.110 --> 02:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
create different levels of teacher
 
02:50:03.349 --> 02:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
certifications that include the various
 
02:50:06.590 --> 02:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
steps of Paris and therefore this would
 
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
sort of help the process of recruiting
 
02:50:12.110 --> 02:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
Paras as teachers because they would
 
02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
then qualify for that I'm not aware of
 
02:50:17.210 --> 02:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
that that's being floated and I don't
 
02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
know how far along I'm not I'm not hurt
 
02:50:20.270 --> 02:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
anything since our meeting I've become
 
02:50:22.910 --> 02:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
aware of it and uh and so I think that
 
02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
would tell you again that there are more
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
people still more people thinking
 
02:50:30.290 --> 02:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
there's need it applies particularly to
 
02:50:30.300 --> 02:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
there's need it applies particularly to
recruiting

02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
recruiting
 
02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:32.270 align:start position:0%
recruiting
um

02:50:32.270 --> 02:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:35.090 --> 02:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
speakers of other languages who may have
 
02:50:37.730 --> 02:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
degrees already and they're discovering
 
02:50:39.770 --> 02:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
that these people can be appointed to
 
02:50:42.170 --> 02:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
emergency kinds of certification
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
positions and things of that I know that
 
02:50:45.830 --> 02:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
I know there are ways to have emergency
 
02:50:48.730 --> 02:50:48.740 align:start position:0%
certifications that's not really right
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
but the same body of people tends to
 
02:50:55.670 --> 02:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:57.349 --> 02:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:50:58.910 --> 02:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative of bringing this forward
 
02:51:00.889 --> 02:51:00.899 align:start position:0%
very important I have a question about
 
02:51:02.990 --> 02:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
is there a minimum number of classes per
 
02:51:05.389 --> 02:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
day so let's say I am a
 
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
health teacher and I can teach two
 
02:51:10.010 --> 02:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
science classes even though I'm not
 
02:51:11.630 --> 02:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
certified in science
 
02:51:13.130 --> 02:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
did you just say you have to be
 
02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
certified in the science or you have to
 
02:51:17.389 --> 02:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
be teaching the classes and I think the
 
02:51:19.550 --> 02:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
intent here is that you have to be as it
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
talks about being a certified teacher uh
 
02:51:25.010 --> 02:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
in their particular discipline or the
 
02:51:26.870 --> 02:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
level that you're working at the the the
 
02:51:30.410 --> 02:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
the bifurcation of the assignment I'm
 
02:51:32.570 --> 02:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
not sure how that would relate to this
 
02:51:35.870 --> 02:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
because I I'm just envisioning maybe
 
02:51:37.370 --> 02:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
um oh no I guess that was a follow-up
 
02:51:39.530 --> 02:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
never mind I'm good I'm sure when we
 
02:51:41.929 --> 02:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
prior to getting to executing this we'll
 
02:51:44.690 --> 02:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
have Mr Appleby in here and because
 
02:51:46.490 --> 02:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of alternative Pathways
 
02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
well High School certification of course
 
02:51:50.270 --> 02:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
you're certified and taking the
 
02:51:52.370 --> 02:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
practices in a specific area but you can
 
02:51:54.790 --> 02:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
teach outside that for a course or two
 
02:51:57.110 --> 02:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
as long as there's not over 50 percent
 
02:51:59.210 --> 02:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
of the time I believe so there there's a
 
02:52:01.550 --> 02:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
lot there that we can inform you about
 
02:52:04.429 --> 02:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
I'd also say that Mr Appleby was also
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
part of the study group that we have
 
02:52:08.090 --> 02:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah he's a member of the
 
02:52:09.889 --> 02:52:09.899 align:start position:0%
non-voting member
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
um question for you representative Miler
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
um we got these the rule underperforming
 
02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:17.050 align:start position:0%
um we got these the rule underperforming
School

02:52:17.050 --> 02:52:17.060 align:start position:0%
School
 
02:52:19.849 --> 02:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh rural school districts
 
02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
underperforming school we have some
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
schools that are in poverty areas but
 
02:52:29.330 --> 02:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
they're still
 
02:52:31.010 --> 02:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
their achievement scores may be fine
 
02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
they're so not they're not
 
02:52:34.490 --> 02:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
underperforming but they can't attract
 
02:52:36.650 --> 02:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
teachers because they don't have to
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
where at all to pay the teachers so
 
02:52:40.910 --> 02:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
their Source there's an additional
 
02:52:42.370 --> 02:52:42.380 align:start position:0%
shortage there
 
02:52:45.230 --> 02:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
so we might want to look at that in
 
02:52:46.910 --> 02:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
terms of how do we make sure that
 
02:52:48.769 --> 02:52:48.779 align:start position:0%
shortage can get into that type of
 
02:52:50.990 --> 02:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
District as well very good yes
 
02:52:52.490 --> 02:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:56.030 --> 02:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
represent cardelli thank you thank you
 
02:52:58.190 --> 02:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
 
02:52:59.929 --> 02:52:59.939 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering in a bigger
 
02:52:59.939 --> 02:53:01.429 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering in a bigger
picture

02:53:01.429 --> 02:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
picture
 
02:53:03.950 --> 02:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
um we have many careers that have
 
02:53:06.769 --> 02:53:06.779 align:start position:0%
shortages around the state uh even
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
advanced welding Etc how do we as a
 
02:53:12.309 --> 02:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
general court
 
02:53:16.849 --> 02:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
determine which careers should have a
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness program
 
02:53:20.870 --> 02:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
are you talking beyond the school
 
02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
district or within this generally for
 
02:53:27.650 --> 02:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
the many careers that have shortages how
 
02:53:29.290 --> 02:53:29.300 align:start position:0%
do we
 
02:53:32.210 --> 02:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
prioritize how do we determine which
 
02:53:34.849 --> 02:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
careers get a loan forgiveness program I
 
02:53:39.769 --> 02:53:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:41.889 --> 02:53:41.899 align:start position:0%
very complicated issue that says
 
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell I think chairman
 
02:53:47.210 --> 02:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
Ladd when you were asking about the the
 
02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
economic disadvantage or I forget if it
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
was Brett Miller and line four on page
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
two says economic disadvantage of the
 
02:53:57.110 --> 02:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
school based on eligibility for funds
 
02:53:59.389 --> 02:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
pursuant to title one so wouldn't that
 
02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
be the economically disadvantaged area
 
02:54:04.610 --> 02:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
also so be rural economically
 
02:54:07.130 --> 02:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged and underperforming
 
02:54:11.330 --> 02:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
I think we hit B and C
 
02:54:16.610 --> 02:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
probably all but you know but there's a
 
02:54:18.050 --> 02:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
number of communities and what I was
 
02:54:19.010 --> 02:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
talking about some of the communities
 
02:54:21.170 --> 02:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
which are small but they just can't
 
02:54:24.769 --> 02:54:24.779 align:start position:0%
attract I live in one where we cannot
 
02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
compete with Lebanon or Hanover down the
 
02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
river and and so the
 
02:54:32.090 --> 02:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
we're all of a sudden we're talking out
 
02:54:34.010 --> 02:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
in our budget coming up how much do we
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
have to put in the budget for labor
 
02:54:37.790 --> 02:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
costs to attract people to our community
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's very typical in the North
 
02:54:41.389 --> 02:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
Country they're undergoing that
 
02:54:41.399 --> 02:54:42.650 align:start position:0%
Country they're undergoing that
everywhere

02:54:42.650 --> 02:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
02:54:44.870 --> 02:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
so we got to address that we have a
 
02:54:46.550 --> 02:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
shortage the biggest shortage we had
 
02:54:48.889 --> 02:54:48.899 align:start position:0%
this year was 800 paraprofessionals in
 
02:54:51.889 --> 02:54:51.899 align:start position:0%
the state that was number one but then
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
it came down those other three and it
 
02:54:59.090 --> 02:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:00.910 --> 02:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
further questions for yes representative
 
02:55:04.490 --> 02:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you is is this not something that
 
02:55:05.809 --> 02:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
could be taken care of at the local
 
02:55:07.730 --> 02:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
level through the local
 
02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
school budget I'm just throwing it out
 
02:55:12.830 --> 02:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
there well I I think obviously local
 
02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
school districts are are looking at this
 
02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
as they try to recruit people I think
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
the intent here is to provide another
 
02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
arrow in their quiver so to speak that
 
02:55:24.230 --> 02:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
they could then go to a potential
 
02:55:26.570 --> 02:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
applicant and say you know we we fall
 
02:55:28.730 --> 02:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
under this category and there is a
 
02:55:31.250 --> 02:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program it's interesting too
 
02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:32.150 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program it's interesting too
that

02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd and I were kind of
 
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
committing about this the other day that
 
02:55:38.030 --> 02:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
when we were going to school there was
 
02:55:40.730 --> 02:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
an NDA loan that we a National Defense
 
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
loan that many of us who are going to be
 
02:55:45.230 --> 02:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
teachers basically took out that loan
 
02:55:47.450 --> 02:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
and then there was a loan forgiveness on
 
02:55:49.910 --> 02:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
that program based upon the numbers of
 
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
years you taught this is not the same
 
02:55:54.290 --> 02:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
thing but it's in the kind of in the
 
02:55:55.969 --> 02:55:55.979 align:start position:0%
same spirit because at that point in
 
02:55:58.250 --> 02:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
time there was a problem as we have now
 
02:56:00.530 --> 02:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
with uh with teacher of recruiting
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
teachers so thank you
 
02:56:06.230 --> 02:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:08.349 --> 02:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
not saying thank you very much thank you
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:21.290 --> 02:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
still morning so good morning thank you
 
02:56:24.290 --> 02:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I'm very aware that uh I
 
02:56:26.510 --> 02:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
may be the last person between uh you
 
02:56:29.210 --> 02:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
and lunch so I will I'll try and be
 
02:56:29.220 --> 02:56:30.590 align:start position:0%
and lunch so I will I'll try and be
brief

02:56:30.590 --> 02:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
brief
 
02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
um for the record Brian Hawkins any New
 
02:56:35.090 --> 02:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh representative Myler
 
02:56:37.250 --> 02:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
captured a lot of the introduction that
 
02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
I was going to cover already with regard
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
to uh the committee that looked at this
 
02:56:45.230 --> 02:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
as a as one piece of the puzzle in
 
02:56:49.250 --> 02:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
trying to address the teacher and
 
02:56:51.889 --> 02:56:51.899 align:start position:0%
educator shortage that we face as you
 
02:56:54.769 --> 02:56:54.779 align:start position:0%
aptly pointed out there there's teachers
 
02:56:56.929 --> 02:56:56.939 align:start position:0%
and then there's also the other staff in
 
02:56:58.670 --> 02:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
the school that are are just as
 
02:57:01.130 --> 02:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
important and um and we need to be
 
02:57:03.230 --> 02:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
addressing that as well
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
um I think that the piece that I would
 
02:57:07.969 --> 02:57:07.979 align:start position:0%
add is uh as a state we are competing
 
02:57:11.030 --> 02:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
with our neighbors uh other states in
 
02:57:13.370 --> 02:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
the country and we are seeing a lot of
 
02:57:15.290 --> 02:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
states that are adopting these types of
 
02:57:19.429 --> 02:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
programs uh that to incentivize uh
 
02:57:22.309 --> 02:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
through and and one of those Central
 
02:57:24.530 --> 02:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
components is this kind of loan
 
02:57:27.410 --> 02:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
repayment uh concept
 
02:57:30.530 --> 02:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that uh representative
 
02:57:33.469 --> 02:57:33.479 align:start position:0%
Miler brought in looks very similar to a
 
02:57:37.370 --> 02:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
law passed in Idaho uh which had the the
 
02:57:39.530 --> 02:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
graduated increase
 
02:57:43.010 --> 02:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and uh at least from the reports that
 
02:57:45.349 --> 02:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
I've seen from that State uh it there
 
02:57:50.030 --> 02:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
was a lot of interest in in in in this
 
02:57:53.630 --> 02:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
in in applying for and participating and
 
02:57:55.490 --> 02:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
um the other piece I would add is that
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
this concept is not something that would
 
02:57:59.450 --> 02:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
be new to the state of New Hampshire
 
02:58:03.170 --> 02:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
either in the area of Health Care uh we
 
02:58:06.170 --> 02:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
have the state loan repayment program uh
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
that is uh through the depart the
 
02:58:11.630 --> 02:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health
 
02:58:13.929 --> 02:58:13.939 align:start position:0%
um that was uh
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
expanded significantly with the
 
02:58:19.849 --> 02:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
assistance of arpa dollars but the
 
02:58:22.670 --> 02:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
program did exist prior to that
 
02:58:25.849 --> 02:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
um and so uh so I think this is
 
02:58:29.929 --> 02:58:29.939 align:start position:0%
something that we can do and would be
 
02:58:31.910 --> 02:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
more than happy to work with the
 
02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
committee to produce a good product
 
02:58:37.130 --> 02:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
because as I said our our neighbors are
 
02:58:40.370 --> 02:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
doing this uh and it's important that we
 
02:58:42.710 --> 02:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh keep up so so that we can compete for
 
02:58:45.889 --> 02:58:45.899 align:start position:0%
that Workforce
 
02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'll I'll close my
 
02:58:49.790 --> 02:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
testimony and happy to answer any
 
02:58:49.800 --> 02:58:51.769 align:start position:0%
testimony and happy to answer any
questions

02:58:51.769 --> 02:58:51.779 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:58:51.779 --> 02:58:54.309 align:start position:0%
questions
foreign

02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:58.010 --> 02:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
I know there's all kinds of negotiations
 
02:59:01.809 --> 02:59:01.819 align:start position:0%
in whatever with schools and teachers
 
02:59:05.870 --> 02:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if rather than doing
 
02:59:10.670 --> 02:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness can we give bonuses for
 
02:59:13.010 --> 02:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
staying at a particular school or is
 
02:59:16.010 --> 02:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
that something in the same amounts
 
02:59:19.309 --> 02:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
is that something that is going to cause
 
02:59:23.170 --> 02:59:23.180 align:start position:0%
problems with the teachers union
 
02:59:27.349 --> 02:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh well I see the concept of what
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative Miller talking about was
 
02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
really it's sort of more a repayment
 
02:59:35.150 --> 02:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
specifically on on the loans and so I I
 
02:59:37.250 --> 02:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
almost see it as a similar
 
02:59:39.230 --> 02:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
situation that you're you're you're
 
02:59:41.690 --> 02:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
you're you're giving
 
02:59:45.349 --> 02:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
um uh the essentially bonuses for a
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
specific thing and I think the benefit
 
02:59:50.330 --> 02:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
of this is the the quicker you pay off
 
02:59:52.610 --> 02:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
those loans the the greater value that
 
02:59:53.990 --> 02:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
is to the individual and that there's
 
02:59:56.510 --> 02:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
not a you know added potential interest
 
02:59:58.370 --> 02:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:00:01.610 --> 03:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
um and I think the other piece is uh
 
03:00:04.790 --> 03:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
there are school districts that do uh do
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
offer uh uh I wouldn't be able to cite
 
03:00:09.710 --> 03:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
them right now but I knew know that
 
03:00:13.910 --> 03:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
there are uh schools that that have uh
 
03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
programs in place uh similar to this but
 
03:00:17.760 --> 03:00:18.950 align:start position:0%
programs in place uh similar to this but
um

03:00:18.950 --> 03:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that we heard
 
03:00:23.269 --> 03:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
at the in the shortage committee was the
 
03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
varying degrees with which school
 
03:00:26.570 --> 03:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
districts throughout the state you know
 
03:00:29.450 --> 03:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility to to do this
 
03:00:31.070 --> 03:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
um we heard from two a couple of
 
03:00:33.469 --> 03:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
superintendents in that uh in that
 
03:00:35.389 --> 03:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
committee some of which talked about uh
 
03:00:38.150 --> 03:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
this this along the lines of the rural
 
03:00:41.269 --> 03:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
challenge is uh I think it was a
 
03:00:43.010 --> 03:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
superintendent from Newport who cited
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
you know they they need additional help
 
03:00:50.330 --> 03:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
in in attracting a young person
 
03:00:54.050 --> 03:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
to relocate to Newport and
 
03:00:56.990 --> 03:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
um so I think this concept kind of goes
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
to that uh particularly because of the
 
03:01:02.450 --> 03:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
graduated increases over a period of
 
03:01:04.730 --> 03:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
several years uh if they're going to
 
03:01:06.650 --> 03:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
stay longer they're also likely more
 
03:01:09.230 --> 03:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
likely to stay there and more likely to
 
03:01:11.870 --> 03:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
succeed as an educator and that that's
 
03:01:14.929 --> 03:01:14.939 align:start position:0%
and that was we heard that from
 
03:01:17.290 --> 03:01:17.300 align:start position:0%
um I think the the both the the
 
03:01:19.370 --> 03:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
superintendents uh that day who who
 
03:01:21.889 --> 03:01:21.899 align:start position:0%
testified for the uh before the study
 
03:01:21.899 --> 03:01:22.849 align:start position:0%
testified for the uh before the study
committee

03:01:22.849 --> 03:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:01:26.030 --> 03:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
the other superintendent from Manchester
 
03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
we have Justified yes and I think from
 
03:01:30.769 --> 03:01:30.779 align:start position:0%
the Mad not too I think mad knock as
 
03:01:32.450 --> 03:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
well that's right
 
03:01:35.950 --> 03:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
um You may did a a comparison to other
 
03:01:38.150 --> 03:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
departments or agencies of the
 
03:01:40.969 --> 03:01:40.979 align:start position:0%
government HHS
 
03:01:40.979 --> 03:01:42.830 align:start position:0%
government HHS
um

03:01:42.830 --> 03:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:45.290 --> 03:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
when I drive by Grafton County
 
03:01:47.750 --> 03:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
nursing home Glencliff there's a sign
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
out five sign seeking lnas we will pay
 
03:01:55.870 --> 03:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
for your LNA certification so is this
 
03:01:59.809 --> 03:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
it's so different that that or so new
 
03:02:02.269 --> 03:02:02.279 align:start position:0%
that our other department areas of edge
 
03:02:04.730 --> 03:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
government as you alluded to doing
 
03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
something similar to attract
 
03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and then another question to follow
 
03:02:12.769 --> 03:02:12.779 align:start position:0%
up how's the four-year system helping us
 
03:02:15.710 --> 03:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
out on this many states
 
03:02:19.130 --> 03:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
will say you come and we'll pay for your
 
03:02:22.130 --> 03:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
master's program if you go teach out
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
there in this school district you come
 
03:02:28.010 --> 03:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
out with a master's paid for
 
03:02:29.929 --> 03:02:29.939 align:start position:0%
um I lived in a state where that
 
03:02:32.150 --> 03:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
occurred but have you heard of that
 
03:02:33.469 --> 03:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
occurring anywhere else in the country
 
03:02:37.610 --> 03:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I'd be happy to uh I have a I
 
03:02:41.150 --> 03:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
had just for reference for questions uh
 
03:02:46.490 --> 03:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
a a paper copy but uh it it really has
 
03:02:49.130 --> 03:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
links to it and so with other states and
 
03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
what they do so I'd be happy I I was
 
03:02:53.210 --> 03:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
intending on sending that to the
 
03:02:54.889 --> 03:02:54.899 align:start position:0%
committee for you to look at what some
 
03:02:56.690 --> 03:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
other states are already doing in that
 
03:02:59.269 --> 03:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
in that area yep and then as I said
 
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
there are I mean there are individual
 
03:03:03.110 --> 03:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
school districts that do some
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
form of this maybe not exactly the way
 
03:03:08.090 --> 03:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
the The Proposal is here but
 
03:03:10.670 --> 03:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah as we've said there's all kinds
 
03:03:13.309 --> 03:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
of ways people are trying to compete for
 
03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
um the workforce
 
03:03:15.120 --> 03:03:16.370 align:start position:0%
um the workforce
no

03:03:16.370 --> 03:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock just a
 
03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up to you as representative why
 
03:03:23.570 --> 03:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
would DHHS did do a host or money that's
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
used for retention the same concept of
 
03:03:28.969 --> 03:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
maintaining their staff in in nursing
 
03:03:31.250 --> 03:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
areas nursing homes and hospitals are
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
the asset funds as well as police
 
03:03:34.670 --> 03:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
department so the concept is the same
 
03:03:36.769 --> 03:03:36.779 align:start position:0%
that was in the Omnibus Bill last year
 
03:03:38.450 --> 03:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
where we had a committee conference I
 
03:03:40.010 --> 03:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
remember fighting for glencliffe to
 
03:03:41.929 --> 03:03:41.939 align:start position:0%
happen to have that money to back pay
 
03:03:44.150 --> 03:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
for what they needed and to provide
 
03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
these incentives and and division of
 
03:03:48.830 --> 03:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
just and a quick comment on that and
 
03:03:51.469 --> 03:03:51.479 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health does that
 
03:03:53.150 --> 03:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
program that I referenced earlier I
 
03:03:55.790 --> 03:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
believe does have a focus on on Rural
 
03:03:57.230 --> 03:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
communities because of the critical
 
03:04:01.969 --> 03:04:01.979 align:start position:0%
access Hospital needs and so uh
 
03:04:04.429 --> 03:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
I had a chance to have a extensive
 
03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
conversation with the now former
 
03:04:09.230 --> 03:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
director there and uh it was very
 
03:04:11.690 --> 03:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
helpful in terms of information on uh
 
03:04:13.370 --> 03:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
how they structured that program
 
03:04:15.469 --> 03:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
so just to note there's another question
 
03:04:16.969 --> 03:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
but we're also seeing the demographic
 
03:04:19.849 --> 03:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
the four-year systems like UNH Keenan
 
03:04:22.730 --> 03:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
and uh Plymouth where participation
 
03:04:24.530 --> 03:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
especially UNH and the Department of
 
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
Education where they're getting their
 
03:04:28.070 --> 03:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
teachers ticket enrollment is declining
 
03:04:28.080 --> 03:04:31.190 align:start position:0%
teachers ticket enrollment is declining
yep

03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:36.849 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:04:36.849 --> 03:04:36.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:40.610 --> 03:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
we're seeing fewer students
 
03:04:43.370 --> 03:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
challenge to go into the education field
 
03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
now for numerous reasons but salary is a
 
03:04:50.990 --> 03:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
huge part of that puzzle yeah
 
03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
03:04:55.429 --> 03:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:04:57.230 --> 03:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
um I perhaps should have asked this of
 
03:05:00.290 --> 03:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
Representative Miler but maybe it fits
 
03:05:00.300 --> 03:05:01.250 align:start position:0%
Representative Miler but maybe it fits
here

03:05:01.250 --> 03:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:05:02.510 --> 03:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there was any
 
03:05:06.469 --> 03:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
discussion or consideration of
 
03:05:09.170 --> 03:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
a situation so a teacher perhaps is
 
03:05:10.670 --> 03:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
taught already for two years in a
 
03:05:13.370 --> 03:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
district and and one that would qualify
 
03:05:15.889 --> 03:05:15.899 align:start position:0%
and is now looking to move to a district
 
03:05:17.330 --> 03:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
That Pays
 
03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars more
 
03:05:22.130 --> 03:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
is there any way for it to be built into
 
03:05:25.610 --> 03:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
the bill for people in that situation to
 
03:05:28.250 --> 03:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
have reimbursement for their first two
 
03:05:29.929 --> 03:05:29.939 align:start position:0%
years that occurred before this bill
 
03:05:29.939 --> 03:05:32.110 align:start position:0%
years that occurred before this bill
passes

03:05:32.110 --> 03:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
passes
 
03:05:35.330 --> 03:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
I yeah I think so so I think that'll be
 
03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh I think that'll be helpful in the in
 
03:05:40.370 --> 03:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
the uh when I send you the different
 
03:05:41.870 --> 03:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
ways states have structured these
 
03:05:44.269 --> 03:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
because there are various ways that they
 
03:05:46.190 --> 03:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
have done that including I think along
 
03:05:48.110 --> 03:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
the lines of what you're referring to
 
03:05:51.590 --> 03:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
sort of retroactive uh yes yeah thank
 
03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:53.630 align:start position:0%
sort of retroactive uh yes yeah thank
you

03:05:53.630 --> 03:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:05:56.570 --> 03:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
yes represent Tanner thank you
 
03:05:58.849 --> 03:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
um I know this is a money incentive and
 
03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
and it's really good but
 
03:06:04.190 --> 03:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
um how much of a money incentive
 
03:06:06.530 --> 03:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
keeps teachers at a school versus the
 
03:06:07.730 --> 03:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
culture of the school and how they're
 
03:06:11.330 --> 03:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
treated and in general how the teaching
 
03:06:13.730 --> 03:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
profession is viewed in in New Hampshire
 
03:06:15.110 --> 03:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
a speaker here I don't know if you were
 
03:06:18.290 --> 03:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
here before when he was talking about
 
03:06:21.889 --> 03:06:21.899 align:start position:0%
how you know the disrupting the
 
03:06:25.790 --> 03:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
education system every way you can and
 
03:06:25.800 --> 03:06:26.510 align:start position:0%
education system every way you can and
um

03:06:26.510 --> 03:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:29.090 --> 03:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
going after teachers with various uh
 
03:06:31.730 --> 03:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
bills that that he mentioned
 
03:06:34.610 --> 03:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
um does that affect teacher retention as
 
03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know do you think do you think it's
 
03:06:38.929 --> 03:06:38.939 align:start position:0%
a balance with the the money I mean I
 
03:06:41.530 --> 03:06:41.540 align:start position:0%
wasn't in teaching for money
 
03:06:44.809 --> 03:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely I think it does
 
03:06:46.429 --> 03:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
03:06:48.479 --> 03:06:49.969 align:start position:0%
it's uh
uh

03:06:49.969 --> 03:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:51.889 --> 03:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
many people obviously have gone into the
 
03:06:55.550 --> 03:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
profession knowing what the salary uh
 
03:06:58.010 --> 03:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
prospects are as a public school
 
03:06:58.020 --> 03:06:59.870 align:start position:0%
prospects are as a public school
educator

03:06:59.870 --> 03:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
educator
 
03:07:03.010 --> 03:07:03.020 align:start position:0%
um and do it for many reasons
 
03:07:05.389 --> 03:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've seen
 
03:07:07.849 --> 03:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and in New Hampshire and as
 
03:07:11.450 --> 03:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
as we you know survey our membership is
 
03:07:17.150 --> 03:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
the percentage uh of which are
 
03:07:19.490 --> 03:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
that has increased in thinking about
 
03:07:21.889 --> 03:07:21.899 align:start position:0%
leaving the professional together or
 
03:07:23.929 --> 03:07:23.939 align:start position:0%
retiring early and a lot of that does
 
03:07:26.269 --> 03:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
have to do with the environment yes for
 
03:07:28.550 --> 03:07:28.560 align:start position:0%

yeah but I don't want to vote against it
 
03:09:04.490 --> 03:09:04.500 align:start position:0%

03:09:06.849 --> 03:09:06.859 align:start position:0%
really needs our attention
 
04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:13.319 --> 04:02:26.410 align:start position:0%

04:03:57.239 --> 04:04:04.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:04:04.849 --> 04:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:07.969 --> 04:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh committee and thank
 
04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
you for the time to speak John Sellers
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
Grafton 18 representing Grafton 18.
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
um this bill is uh it looks long and
 
04:04:21.889 --> 04:04:21.899 align:start position:0%
wordy and but really it's it's pretty
 
04:04:23.809 --> 04:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
simple it's it's all it's trying to do
 
04:04:26.929 --> 04:04:26.939 align:start position:0%
is take you have a budget for a school
 
04:04:29.750 --> 04:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
budget and all I want to do is overall
 
04:04:32.750 --> 04:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
is take the SAU the administrative part
 
04:04:34.969 --> 04:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
of it and put it into a separate warrant
 
04:04:37.250 --> 04:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
article so as you vote on the budget as
 
04:04:39.050 --> 04:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
a warrant article they want to put the
 
04:04:42.050 --> 04:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
SAU the administration unit or like the
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
all the administrators the SAU the
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
superintendent and all the uh
 
04:04:49.969 --> 04:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
other folks there that make up the SAU
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
office right so it keeps that way they
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
can easily see you know how much is a
 
04:04:57.050 --> 04:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
cost to me on the administrative side
 
04:04:59.090 --> 04:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
versus how much it's cost me on the
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
actual School side
 
04:05:04.490 --> 04:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
and when you have co-ops you know you
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
also have yeah maybe three different
 
04:05:10.130 --> 04:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
saus that you're looking at uh and then
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
some districts like ours we only have
 
04:05:14.689 --> 04:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
one SAU and it's not as a big a deal but
 
04:05:17.450 --> 04:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's easier for anybody to
 
04:05:19.010 --> 04:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
look in line by line to figure out
 
04:05:21.170 --> 04:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
what's costing what
 
04:05:23.689 --> 04:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
so that's that's one part of this the
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
other part is uh basically where am I on
 
04:05:29.150 --> 04:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
page two here
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh if this is if anybody knows about
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
default budgets uh sb2 you have a
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
proposed budget and a default budget so
 
04:05:42.349 --> 04:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
both budgets are presented the default
 
04:05:45.170 --> 04:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
budget is there in case the proposed
 
04:05:47.630 --> 04:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
budget never gets voted uh voted down
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
let's put it that way so the default
 
04:05:52.010 --> 04:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
budget is always last year's plus or
 
04:05:52.020 --> 04:05:53.389 align:start position:0%
budget is always last year's plus or
minus

04:05:53.389 --> 04:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
minus
 
04:05:55.370 --> 04:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
um adjustments at that point so that's
 
04:05:57.710 --> 04:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
really what Essa the two is on page two
 
04:05:59.929 --> 04:05:59.939 align:start position:0%
or four and then the last part of that
 
04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
on page three or maybe a bottom page two
 
04:06:05.170 --> 04:06:05.180 align:start position:0%
and Page Three it's just the process of
 
04:06:07.130 --> 04:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
balloting and how that's going to work
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
make sure the balance of tracked and
 
04:06:12.889 --> 04:06:12.899 align:start position:0%
given to the right person and so on
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to stay up a lot of
 
04:06:16.010 --> 04:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
time I just want to leave that with you
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
and I know somebody else is going to
 
04:06:19.490 --> 04:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
speak to this as well
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Balboni
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
hi thanks I have a couple questions
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
um because I I'm Pat representing towns
 
04:06:31.790 --> 04:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
that have an SAU
 
04:06:33.530 --> 04:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
um does this apply it says Spirit
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
districts without an annual meeting does
 
04:06:39.229 --> 04:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
this also apply to sv2 tests
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to let the other person
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
speak to that because I I know there's
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
one part in here and I did read it and
 
04:06:47.689 --> 04:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
I'll have to read it over again that
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
specifically says something about that
 
04:06:51.410 --> 04:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
04:06:52.969 --> 04:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
and just
 
04:06:52.979 --> 04:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
and just
oh

04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.210 --> 04:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a separate card is that all
 
04:07:01.250 --> 04:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
um and you're essentially pulling this
 
04:07:08.750 --> 04:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
SAU portion out of each town this budget
 
04:07:12.410 --> 04:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
within the SAU and each and then it's
 
04:07:16.250 --> 04:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
going to be voted on separately for each
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
Town what happens if it's rejected so so
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's the pot on page two here where
 
04:07:26.210 --> 04:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
you have uh let's look at the lines 13
 
04:07:30.290 --> 04:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh 14 15 16 right in there you know it
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
talks about the adjusted budget all
 
04:07:34.189 --> 04:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
right at that point so you always have
 
04:07:36.650 --> 04:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
the proposed budget and then the you
 
04:07:39.229 --> 04:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
always have a backup budget which is
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
always the last year's budget no matter
 
04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
what they always get the same amount
 
04:07:45.410 --> 04:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
they actually worked with last year
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
bottom line plus or minus any
 
04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
adjustments like if a one administrator
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
they said well we'll not keep an
 
04:07:52.969 --> 04:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
administrator then that budget would be
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
down on the what I call the default
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
budget of these just a budget so there's
 
04:08:00.889 --> 04:08:00.899 align:start position:0%
very little adjustments that go on on
 
04:08:04.370 --> 04:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
that secondary budget at that point all
 
04:08:06.590 --> 04:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
right the proposed budget is saying you
 
04:08:09.170 --> 04:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
know it's the uh administrators saying
 
04:08:11.689 --> 04:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
our you know the SAU uh superintendency
 
04:08:13.790 --> 04:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
all right well we need a you know a
 
04:08:15.290 --> 04:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
raise for this person this person this
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
person this person and uh we're also
 
04:08:19.849 --> 04:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
hiring our new administrator to do XYZ
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
so this is our proposed budget at this
 
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
point say a million dollars but now the
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
old one could actually say the default
 
04:08:28.610 --> 04:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
budget could actually say hey you're at
 
04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
900 000 because that's what you well
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's what it took to run the
 
04:08:34.610 --> 04:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
administrative part of the school last
 
04:08:34.620 --> 04:08:35.570 align:start position:0%
administrative part of the school last
year

04:08:35.570 --> 04:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:08:37.370 --> 04:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
04:08:39.239 --> 04:08:40.910 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
representative

04:08:40.910 --> 04:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:42.349 --> 04:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:42.359 --> 04:08:43.370 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:08:43.370 --> 04:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:45.590 --> 04:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
I have two questions also the first one
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
is why do we need this bill
 
04:08:50.929 --> 04:08:50.939 align:start position:0%
it's it's really for clarity it's it's
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
really making allowing the voters to see
 
04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
how much the immediate administrative
 
04:09:00.110 --> 04:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
side of the school budgets costing and
 
04:09:01.729 --> 04:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
it's you know and like I said when you
 
04:09:05.090 --> 04:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
have only one administrative unit uh
 
04:09:09.290 --> 04:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
like a Nas yeah our district does it's
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's pretty easy to figure that out but
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
when you have three because you might
 
04:09:16.250 --> 04:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
have three sau's all combined as a co-op
 
04:09:18.469 --> 04:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
so it when you when you separate it out
 
04:09:20.330 --> 04:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
like that now they're able to vote on
 
04:09:22.610 --> 04:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
just the administrative side and just
 
04:09:24.410 --> 04:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
the school side but no matter what they
 
04:09:26.570 --> 04:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
both get an amount they they'll never be
 
04:09:26.580 --> 04:09:27.590 align:start position:0%
both get an amount they they'll never be
zero

04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
zero
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
my my second follow-up yeah my second
 
04:09:33.410 --> 04:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
question is uh also in those lines that
 
04:09:38.090 --> 04:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
you are uh on page one I guess it is
 
04:09:40.610 --> 04:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
um you know starting at 13.
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
um you have the apportionment at half
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
and half and a lot of the co-ops aren't
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
half and half on average daily
 
04:09:51.769 --> 04:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
enrollment and equalized values so why
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
why in this one does it go to half and
 
04:09:54.239 --> 04:09:56.090 align:start position:0%
why in this one does it go to half and
half

04:09:56.090 --> 04:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
half
 
04:09:59.530 --> 04:09:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:03.189 --> 04:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
shall be based on half the average daily
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh membership and half on the most
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
recently available equalized evaluation
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
okay so look instead of me answering
 
04:10:13.010 --> 04:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
that question I don't know the specifics
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
on that okay and I don't want to say
 
04:10:18.830 --> 04:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
I I would hope to believe that it could
 
04:10:22.429 --> 04:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
be all ADM or 50 50 or 100 you know at
 
04:10:24.650 --> 04:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
100 so I don't want to answer that I'm
 
04:10:25.610 --> 04:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
going to leave it to the next person
 
04:10:27.889 --> 04:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
here so if that's okay sure that's just
 
04:10:32.269 --> 04:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
not the way co-ops work okay
 
04:10:34.429 --> 04:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
04:10:36.290 --> 04:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
my question so on page two where you
 
04:10:41.450 --> 04:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
were referencing the proposed budget
 
04:10:44.929 --> 04:10:44.939 align:start position:0%
versus the default budget lines 13 to
 
04:10:44.939 --> 04:10:46.370 align:start position:0%
versus the default budget lines 13 to
18.

04:10:46.370 --> 04:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
18.
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
so what happens if communities don't all
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
vote the same way so one community may
 
04:10:56.689 --> 04:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
approve the new budget that's presumably
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
more than the default budget and another
 
04:11:01.130 --> 04:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
Community doesn't then
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
the funding of the SAU is compromised
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
yes I I see a point and uh instead of me
 
04:11:10.490 --> 04:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
answering that I'm going to leave it to
 
04:11:11.689 --> 04:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
the next person because he actually
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
deals with multiple scus within the
 
04:11:16.490 --> 04:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
co-op mine's only a single so it makes a
 
04:11:18.410 --> 04:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
little bit harder for me
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
I have representative woodcock thank you
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
chairman cordelli good afternoon thank
 
04:11:24.710 --> 04:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question
 
04:11:28.189 --> 04:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
um I need to be totally up front as a
 
04:11:29.929 --> 04:11:29.939 align:start position:0%
former School administrator this makes
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:34.370 --> 04:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
um because I see the isolation of
 
04:11:37.189 --> 04:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
Administrators out there and sometimes
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
that has a difficult term with people in
 
04:11:41.030 --> 04:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
the community and then but you didn't
 
04:11:43.250 --> 04:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
isolate Athletics it didn't isolate
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
Learning Community he didn't isolate
 
04:11:47.389 --> 04:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
Media Services he didn't isolate art and
 
04:11:50.090 --> 04:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
drama the isolated administrators and
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
everyone else
 
04:11:54.710 --> 04:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
and that makes me nervous for those
 
04:11:56.689 --> 04:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
folks that are in the administrative
 
04:11:59.150 --> 04:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
career track are working in the schools
 
04:12:01.010 --> 04:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
that every time it's been well just kind
 
04:12:02.269 --> 04:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
of ministry is kind of administrative
 
04:12:04.969 --> 04:12:04.979 align:start position:0%
prime minister is versus look at the
 
04:12:07.130 --> 04:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
budget and make a budget decision and am
 
04:12:08.929 --> 04:12:08.939 align:start position:0%
I reading this right am I just am I in
 
04:12:10.610 --> 04:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
the wrong Street altogether or is that
 
04:12:13.010 --> 04:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
the intent well no I don't think the
 
04:12:14.689 --> 04:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
intent are that way the intent is
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
realistically is to make sure there's
 
04:12:19.130 --> 04:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
Clarity so all the voters can see how
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
much the administrative part of the
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
school district is costing versus the
 
04:12:25.130 --> 04:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
school district you know the teaching
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
part and the operation of the school
 
04:12:28.849 --> 04:12:28.859 align:start position:0%
district and I follow chairman cardelli
 
04:12:31.010 --> 04:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
yes one thank you so why would you
 
04:12:32.929 --> 04:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
isolate Athletics the media services and
 
04:12:34.849 --> 04:12:34.859 align:start position:0%
have every every segment out there so
 
04:12:36.290 --> 04:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
they can see very clearly what the cost
 
04:12:36.300 --> 04:12:37.250 align:start position:0%
they can see very clearly what the cost
was

04:12:37.250 --> 04:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:12:39.290 --> 04:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
I would believe it I know as far as in
 
04:12:43.130 --> 04:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
our budget we have about 1700 lines and
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's that
 
04:12:47.570 --> 04:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
is a line item I can actually identify
 
04:12:49.849 --> 04:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
okay so when you have three when you
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
have a co-op and you have three
 
04:12:54.889 --> 04:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
different uh saus it's all together and
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
so you don't know as far as well this Au
 
04:12:59.330 --> 04:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
SAU is this and that one's this one okay
 
04:13:02.450 --> 04:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you Joe Kelly
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:13:06.050 --> 04:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
to see none thank you very much
 
04:13:08.330 --> 04:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I'd like to
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:11.520 --> 04:13:24.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:13:24.370 --> 04:13:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman cordelli good
 
04:13:28.130 --> 04:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the community bear
 
04:13:29.330 --> 04:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
Christina from the school boards
 
04:13:31.370 --> 04:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
Association we are opposed
 
04:13:37.070 --> 04:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:39.710 --> 04:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
um a couple Provisions in the bill that
 
04:13:42.530 --> 04:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
I think are convoluting two different
 
04:13:44.630 --> 04:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
areas of law
 
04:13:48.050 --> 04:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
um so for example I'm on page one of the
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill line 13.
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'll actually started at line
 
04:13:54.050 --> 04:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
three it says at a meeting held before
 
04:13:56.210 --> 04:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
January 1st this school administrative
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
unit board or board for school
 
04:14:02.570 --> 04:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
administrative units comprising only one
 
04:14:05.269 --> 04:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
district and then jumping down to pay
 
04:14:07.130 --> 04:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
and I'll wrap this up I'll get to the
 
04:14:09.889 --> 04:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
point and then pH third line 13 on page
 
04:14:12.110 --> 04:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
one the provisions of this paragraph
 
04:14:14.210 --> 04:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
apply to school administrative units
 
04:14:17.210 --> 04:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
comprising two or more districts single
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
District saus are considered
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
um just single districts there's there's
 
04:14:27.370 --> 04:14:27.380 align:start position:0%
no Provisions in in RSA 194c
 
04:14:30.830 --> 04:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
that fully apply to single District saus
 
04:14:32.689 --> 04:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think Berlin is a single
 
04:14:34.429 --> 04:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
District SAU Salem is a single District
 
04:14:37.250 --> 04:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
SAU Manchester is a single District SAU
 
04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton is a single District SAU just
 
04:14:41.809 --> 04:14:41.819 align:start position:0%
to Dairy is a single District SAU
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
Wakefield is a single District SAU

Hudson is a single District SAU Concord
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
is a single District SAU that's trying
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
to vote no no you're with Dunbarton
 
04:14:52.010 --> 04:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
these days so
 
04:14:55.250 --> 04:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I I so single District essay used the
 
04:14:57.889 --> 04:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
provisions of a the the SAU budget found
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
in RSA 194. C don't apply to single
 
04:15:05.650 --> 04:15:05.660 align:start position:0%
district saus and that is in
 
04:15:05.660 --> 04:15:07.330 align:start position:0%
district saus and that is in
194c3

04:15:07.330 --> 04:15:07.340 align:start position:0%
194c3
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%

04:15:16.729 --> 04:15:16.739 align:start position:0%
be considered the same as a single

school district and shall be exempt from
 
04:15:22.010 --> 04:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
the meeting requirements of this chapter

superintendent super services pursuant
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
to RSA 194 C4 so the language in the
 
04:15:30.769 --> 04:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
first parts of the bill we're talking
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
about this is what a single District SAU
 
04:15:34.729 --> 04:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
has to do single District SAU has a
 
04:15:36.650 --> 04:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
budget there's no SAU budget where
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're carving out the administrators
 
04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the SAU staff and your special ed
 
04:15:43.849 --> 04:15:43.859 align:start position:0%
director and things of that nature this
 
04:15:47.570 --> 04:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
is also reaffirmed at RSA 1941a
 
04:15:50.530 --> 04:15:50.540 align:start position:0%
this is the school district statute RSA
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
1941a single District school
 
04:15:55.250 --> 04:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
administrative units as provided in RSA
 
04:15:58.130 --> 04:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
194 C3 single District school
 
04:15:59.990 --> 04:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
administrative units shall be considered
 
04:16:03.769 --> 04:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
the same as single school districts so
 
04:16:06.650 --> 04:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
um and you know and I'm jumping over
 
04:16:10.570 --> 04:16:10.580 align:start position:0%
then to page two line eight paragraph 4A
 
04:16:13.309 --> 04:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me the provisions of this
 
04:16:15.410 --> 04:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
paragraph apply to districts with an
 
04:16:17.689 --> 04:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
annual meeting oh then that would sort
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
of loop it back around to districts that
 
04:16:22.849 --> 04:16:22.859 align:start position:0%
are a single District SAU that have an
 
04:16:24.830 --> 04:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
annual meeting like the districts I just
 
04:16:27.189 --> 04:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned save for Berlin and Manchester
 
04:16:30.110 --> 04:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
where they would be doing this they a
 
04:16:32.570 --> 04:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
single District essay you would I think
 
04:16:34.910 --> 04:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
be having two budgets then which doesn't
 
04:16:36.530 --> 04:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
make sense that's not what happens a
 
04:16:38.929 --> 04:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
single District SAU has a single has a
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
single budget it doesn't carve out the
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
administrative costs you can do that by
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the line items within within
 
04:16:47.450 --> 04:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
your budget that you'll have to pull
 
04:16:49.429 --> 04:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
Post online and make public before your
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
the other aspect why this bill nhsb
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
believes this is unnecessary I'm jumping
 
04:16:59.150 --> 04:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
to RSA 194 C9
 
04:17:01.729 --> 04:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
B and C
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
194 c9a has an alternative budget
 
04:17:07.370 --> 04:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
procedure and a method of adoption where
 
04:17:09.290 --> 04:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
if you don't want to just put it within
 
04:17:11.330 --> 04:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
the SAU budget within your regular
 
04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
District operating budget there's
 
04:17:18.110 --> 04:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions in B and C RSA 190 I'm sorry
 
04:17:18.120 --> 04:17:21.769 align:start position:0%
Provisions in B and C RSA 190 I'm sorry
194cb

04:17:21.769 --> 04:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start over with that I
 
04:17:27.769 --> 04:17:27.779 align:start position:0%
apologize 194 c9a alternative budget
 
04:17:30.550 --> 04:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
procedure and then Ultra and then 194
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
c9b alternative but also on alternative
 
04:17:35.570 --> 04:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
budget procedure
 
04:17:38.330 --> 04:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
um you the voters of the SAU can adopt a
 
04:17:41.929 --> 04:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
provision where the SAU budget already
 
04:17:43.570 --> 04:17:43.580 align:start position:0%
goes on to
 
04:17:46.969 --> 04:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
your local District warrant article is a
 
04:17:49.010 --> 04:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
separate as a separate article where
 
04:17:51.050 --> 04:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
instead of just combining the SAU budget
 
04:17:53.389 --> 04:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
in your operating budget it goes on as a
 
04:17:55.130 --> 04:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
separate warrant article and the towns
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
collectively have to approve it so to
 
04:17:59.330 --> 04:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
some degree that's what this bill is is
 
04:18:01.070 --> 04:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
doing by saying you have to put it on
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
you have to put the budget on as a
 
04:18:05.870 --> 04:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
separate warrant article for your essay
 
04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
you want to have to be approved by the
 
04:18:08.809 --> 04:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
majority of the voters within those
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
communities what the current law doesn't
 
04:18:13.250 --> 04:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
have is the sort of default budget
 
04:18:15.950 --> 04:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
provision but if the voters want to put
 
04:18:18.830 --> 04:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
the D put their SAU Budget on as a
 
04:18:19.849 --> 04:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
separate warrant article in their
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
communities they can already do that
 
04:18:22.490 --> 04:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
they don't need the statute to do that
 
04:18:25.370 --> 04:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
that's already allowed so those are
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
nhsbas I guess primary concerns with the
 
04:18:30.050 --> 04:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
bill the the language in the bill about
 
04:18:31.969 --> 04:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
a single district school district single
 
04:18:34.250 --> 04:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
single District SAU having to comply
 
04:18:35.809 --> 04:18:35.819 align:start position:0%
with these budget processes that's not
 
04:18:37.729 --> 04:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
that's not how this works I mean there's
 
04:18:39.170 --> 04:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
already a method in law that allows
 
04:18:41.210 --> 04:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
voters to do this to put it on as a
 
04:18:42.889 --> 04:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
separate warrant article and then vote
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
on it separately if they want so with
 
04:18:47.210 --> 04:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
that I'm conclude my testimony I'm happy
 
04:18:49.189 --> 04:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you
 
04:18:51.769 --> 04:18:51.779 align:start position:0%
representative Myler thank you Mr
 
04:18:53.090 --> 04:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:18:55.610 --> 04:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
question I have two questions
 
04:18:58.729 --> 04:18:58.739 align:start position:0%
one can you define for us what
 
04:19:01.610 --> 04:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
administrative costs would be that's one
 
04:19:05.210 --> 04:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
right and secondly can't currently if
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to know what the
 
04:19:08.570 --> 04:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are in the
 
04:19:10.490 --> 04:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
development of that once you define what
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
the administrative costs are can't the
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee at that point in time
 
04:19:18.530 --> 04:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
then say okay let's call out those and
 
04:19:19.969 --> 04:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
for those who want to know what the
 
04:19:22.130 --> 04:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are then they would
 
04:19:24.349 --> 04:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
be available I mean isn't that already
 
04:19:26.870 --> 04:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
available two questions thank you very
 
04:19:29.450 --> 04:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
much for the questions uh representative
 
04:19:29.460 --> 04:19:30.590 align:start position:0%
much for the questions uh representative
Miler

04:19:30.590 --> 04:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
Miler
 
04:19:32.150 --> 04:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
um to one degree what I think I might
 
04:19:34.130 --> 04:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
ask is I mean I'm not familiar with sort
 
04:19:35.750 --> 04:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the dra
 
04:19:37.610 --> 04:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
well I'm like in budget forms that
 
04:19:38.809 --> 04:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
school board members have to put
 
04:19:42.349 --> 04:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
together but so some of you might be
 
04:19:44.809 --> 04:19:44.819 align:start position:0%
familiar with it is there a line item
 
04:19:47.389 --> 04:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
for your SAU if it for your local budget
 
04:19:48.769 --> 04:19:48.779 align:start position:0%
is there a linebacker for your essay you
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
want the dra form there may be there may
 
04:19:52.610 --> 04:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know offhand you'd be able to
 
04:19:54.769 --> 04:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
access the information that way so you'd
 
04:19:56.750 --> 04:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
at least know aside from defining
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
administrative costs you would know this
 
04:20:00.889 --> 04:20:00.899 align:start position:0%
school district the Bose school district
 
04:20:02.809 --> 04:20:02.819 align:start position:0%
is paying this amount of money for SAU
 
04:20:04.370 --> 04:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
services and the Dunbarton school
 
04:20:05.929 --> 04:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
district is paying this amount of money
 
04:20:08.929 --> 04:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
for SAU Services I mean you know I
 
04:20:10.849 --> 04:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
presume an argument could be made that
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
all administrative Services would be
 
04:20:16.269 --> 04:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
everything that your SAU
 
04:20:19.490 --> 04:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
spends salaries paper clips Staples
 
04:20:23.090 --> 04:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
toner some sau's rent space it's almost
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
often nominal you know like a buck a
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
year that town will donate some space or
 
04:20:28.610 --> 04:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
whatnot so
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
um and I think I answered both your
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative Miler if I
 
04:20:34.849 --> 04:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
missed one I'm happy to be here thank

and educational excellence
 
04:21:34.490 --> 04:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to speak to you here a little
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
today about you know the bill the
 
04:21:36.239 --> 04:21:37.670 align:start position:0%
today about you know the bill the
motivation

04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
motivation
 
04:21:40.070 --> 04:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
um get background in the solution uh
 
04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
first of all the history is that
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
spending a public education is rapidly
 
04:21:47.150 --> 04:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
increasing Nationwide and in New
 
04:21:47.160 --> 04:21:48.170 align:start position:0%
increasing Nationwide and in New
Hampshire

04:21:48.170 --> 04:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the spending is on school
 
04:21:52.010 --> 04:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
administrators it's driving much of this
 
04:21:52.020 --> 04:21:53.050 align:start position:0%
administrators it's driving much of this
increase

04:21:53.050 --> 04:21:53.060 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hillsdale College president published an
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
article in November showing that the
 
04:22:00.110 --> 04:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
number of Public School District
 
04:22:03.050 --> 04:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
administrators from night from 2000 to
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
2019 grew 79 percent
 
04:22:08.090 --> 04:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
but we only added nine percent more
 
04:22:08.100 --> 04:22:09.349 align:start position:0%
but we only added nine percent more
teachers

04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
so 79 more administrators nine percent
 
04:22:14.570 --> 04:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
more teachers
 
04:22:16.490 --> 04:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
um our state board of education member
 
04:22:18.769 --> 04:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
Ryan Terrell did a union leading
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
editorial on January 2nd talked about
 
04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
how the cost per pupil is Up 77 percent
 
04:22:27.050 --> 04:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
adjusted for inflation but teachers
 
04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
salaries are only up one percent
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
adjusted for inflation
 
04:22:33.229 --> 04:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
the number of non-teaching staff
 
04:22:35.330 --> 04:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
typically administrators is up 80
 
04:22:37.250 --> 04:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
percent but the number of teachers in
 
04:22:39.710 --> 04:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is only up 23 percent
 
04:22:41.090 --> 04:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we're at a risk of
 
04:22:43.309 --> 04:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
having too few administrators the other
 
04:22:44.570 --> 04:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
the other challenge is that
 
04:22:46.010 --> 04:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
administrators are the highest paid
 
04:22:47.389 --> 04:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
Personnel that we have in our school
 
04:22:49.729 --> 04:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
district and many of them are in well
 
04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
into the six figures
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
so the challenge is is that in many many
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
school administrators not all are
 
04:22:59.929 --> 04:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
employed by the what we call the SAU or
 
04:23:02.750 --> 04:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
the school administrative unit
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
these highest paid employees
 
04:23:08.210 --> 04:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
um there's examples of how much they get
 
04:23:09.530 --> 04:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
paid you can go to the Department of
 
04:23:11.330 --> 04:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
Education site I gave you the link here
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
we have 10 superintendents in the state
 
04:23:16.189 --> 04:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
that are making over 170 000 there's
 
04:23:19.250 --> 04:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
actually one making almost 193 thousand
 
04:23:19.260 --> 04:23:20.150 align:start position:0%
actually one making almost 193 thousand
dollars

04:23:20.150 --> 04:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:23:22.969 --> 04:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
there's 51 assistant superintendents and
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
we have eight sau's that have two or
 
04:23:26.570 --> 04:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
more assistants
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
so SAU Personnel growth and SAU budget
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
growth is a significant challenge
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
and we've had this happening despite
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
following student enrollment as you're
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
aware of from Department of Education
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
so if you have a background at most
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
annual district meetings
 
04:23:47.570 --> 04:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
the SAU budget is part of the school
 
04:23:51.050 --> 04:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
operating budget so it's generally not
 
04:23:55.969 --> 04:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
talked about at a annual meeting the
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
SAU budget is actually uh you can find
 
04:24:01.610 --> 04:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
it if you dig for it sometimes you can't
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
find it
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
um but the the where it comes from is if
 
04:24:08.990 --> 04:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
you're not familiar with this process in
 
04:24:10.610 --> 04:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
December every year
 
04:24:14.330 --> 04:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
the the SAU board or the school board if
 
04:24:15.710 --> 04:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's the single District
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
they approve an SAU budget
 
04:24:21.170 --> 04:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
and that's what's being that's that that
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
becomes your SAU budget it's approved in
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
December besides those members that are
 
04:24:27.889 --> 04:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
on the school board it's not modified by
 
04:24:27.899 --> 04:24:28.910 align:start position:0%
on the school board it's not modified by
voters

04:24:28.910 --> 04:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
voters
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
there is a provision for an adjusted
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
budget I'll talk about that in a second
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
so in multi-district sau's the SAU
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
budget is a portion to the member school
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
districts and I know there was a
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
question that came up about that the
 
04:24:45.170 --> 04:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
current law is that it's 50 average
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
daily membership 50 equalized valuation
 
04:24:49.849 --> 04:24:49.859 align:start position:0%
that's current law that's not being
 
04:24:52.729 --> 04:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
changed by this bill that's the formula
 
04:24:54.530 --> 04:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
it's the default formula for co-ops
 
04:24:56.269 --> 04:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
that's what they use for SAU
 
04:24:58.010 --> 04:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
apportionment if you want to call it
 
04:24:58.020 --> 04:24:59.150 align:start position:0%
apportionment if you want to call it
that

04:24:59.150 --> 04:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:02.150 --> 04:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
in multi-destrict sau's
 
04:25:04.130 --> 04:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
so that the budget is then a portion to
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
the member School District so they're a
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
portioned part becomes part of each
 
04:25:10.370 --> 04:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
School District's operating budget as a
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
line item
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
but the problem is you typically cannot
 
04:25:17.830 --> 04:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
do anything about this uh as a voter
 
04:25:20.510 --> 04:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
after that governing board sets that
 
04:25:21.950 --> 04:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
budget in December it's pretty much
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
there you can't change it you can't zero
 
04:25:26.929 --> 04:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
out as SAU budget line item and if you
 
04:25:29.150 --> 04:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
do attempt to change that it can just be
 
04:25:30.530 --> 04:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
moved around because that's the way
 
04:25:32.990 --> 04:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal budgeting works
 
04:25:35.450 --> 04:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
there is a procedure that was talked
 
04:25:35.460 --> 04:25:36.410 align:start position:0%
there is a procedure that was talked
about

04:25:36.410 --> 04:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:25:39.969 --> 04:25:39.979 align:start position:0%
um that is adoptable it's RSA
 
04:25:42.410 --> 04:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
184c9b and a which is the adoption
 
04:25:42.420 --> 04:25:43.849 align:start position:0%
184c9b and a which is the adoption
procedure

04:25:43.849 --> 04:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
that is only available currently to
 
04:25:48.170 --> 04:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
multi-district SAU so you have to have
 
04:25:49.849 --> 04:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
let me use an example so there's a
 
04:25:52.130 --> 04:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion on sb2 towns and
 
04:25:52.140 --> 04:25:53.510 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion on sb2 towns and
co-ops

04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
co-ops
 
04:25:55.910 --> 04:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll use the example of where I'm
 
04:25:59.330 --> 04:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
from I'm in uh I live in Brookline we
 
04:26:01.849 --> 04:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
have a Hollis Brookline Cooperative
 
04:26:03.229 --> 04:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
School District I was on the school
 
04:26:04.670 --> 04:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
board there
 
04:26:07.969 --> 04:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
we have a k-6 Brookline Elementary
 
04:26:10.910 --> 04:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
District and we have a Hollis k-6
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
Elementary District so we actually have
 
04:26:16.370 --> 04:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
three school districts two of them are
 
04:26:18.469 --> 04:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
from the each town and actually one is a
 
04:26:20.389 --> 04:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
co-op seven through twelve together
 
04:26:23.689 --> 04:26:23.699 align:start position:0%
those three towns are a are under one
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
SAU SAU 41. so that's a multi-district
 
04:26:27.479 --> 04:26:29.210 align:start position:0%
SAU SAU 41. so that's a multi-district
SAU

04:26:29.210 --> 04:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
SAU
 
04:26:29.220 --> 04:26:29.990 align:start position:0%
SAU
um

04:26:29.990 --> 04:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
in each of these
 
04:26:34.670 --> 04:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
each school district is free to adopt
 
04:26:39.290 --> 04:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
sb2 or not and in our case the co-op and
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
the Hollis School District are still
 
04:26:44.210 --> 04:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
traditional and the Brookline School
 
04:26:45.649 --> 04:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
District is sb2
 
04:26:47.149 --> 04:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of hopefully that
 
04:26:48.349 --> 04:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
clarifies and we'll answer questions
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
more in that area so
 
04:26:53.750 --> 04:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
we actually have adopted this procedure
 
04:26:56.290 --> 04:26:56.300 align:start position:0%
and we use it so on every
 
04:26:56.300 --> 04:26:58.389 align:start position:0%
and we use it so on every
current

04:26:58.389 --> 04:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
warrant you will see an operating budget
 
04:27:04.429 --> 04:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
and you'll see a separate SAU budget
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
an SAU budget that's proposed and then
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
we have the because we passed this and
 
04:27:09.969 --> 04:27:09.979 align:start position:0%
it was not easy
 
04:27:13.130 --> 04:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
we have also a what they call an
 
04:27:14.929 --> 04:27:14.939 align:start position:0%
adjusted budget which is similar to the
 
04:27:18.349 --> 04:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
sb2 concept of an of a default budget
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
last year's expenditures minus
 
04:27:20.520 --> 04:27:22.969 align:start position:0%
last year's expenditures minus
adjustments

04:27:22.969 --> 04:27:22.979 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
however so I mentioned this alternative
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
budget procedure is only available for
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
multi-discrit SAU so if you're in a
 
04:27:31.070 --> 04:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
single District SAU you can't have the
 
04:27:33.410 --> 04:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
budget pulled out you can't vote on it
 
04:27:35.210 --> 04:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
you don't have the option of an adjusted
 
04:27:37.250 --> 04:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
budget which I think is unfair to those
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
so when you actually vote with the
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
alternative procedure at every district
 
04:27:45.600 --> 04:27:46.910 align:start position:0%
alternative procedure at every district
meeting

04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
you you it's a yes no question if it's a
 
04:27:51.889 --> 04:27:51.899 align:start position:0%
traditional meeting it's a yes no ballot
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
at the annual meeting and if it's sb2
 
04:27:56.929 --> 04:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
it's on the official ballot they just
 
04:27:59.149 --> 04:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
count up the count up the ballots and
 
04:28:01.130 --> 04:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
Hollis they count up the ballots in
 
04:28:02.570 --> 04:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
Brookline and they count up the ballots
 
04:28:04.670 --> 04:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
for the co-op they add them all up if
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
the yeses are greater than the no's you
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
have the proposed budget if the yeses
 
04:28:11.330 --> 04:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
are not then you have the adjusted
 
04:28:13.250 --> 04:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
budget that's how it works
 
04:28:16.010 --> 04:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
and that's the current procedure so the
 
04:28:17.570 --> 04:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
idea on this bill
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
going on to this is the SB 155 basically
 
04:28:24.649 --> 04:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
provides this procedure to all school
 
04:28:24.659 --> 04:28:26.090 align:start position:0%
provides this procedure to all school
districts

04:28:26.090 --> 04:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:28:27.950 --> 04:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
so that the essay budget's a separate
 
04:28:29.389 --> 04:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
worn article
 
04:28:32.330 --> 04:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
for all school districts it'll be on the
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
annual warrant so you'll have an
 
04:28:35.090 --> 04:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
operating budget and you have an SAU
 
04:28:37.610 --> 04:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
budget we have that now because we've
 
04:28:40.429 --> 04:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
altered we've adopted the procedure
 
04:28:42.170 --> 04:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm not doing it for my school
 
04:28:44.630 --> 04:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
district I'm doing it for you know the
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
rest of New Hampshire that doesn't have
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
this there are a few school districts
 
04:28:50.630 --> 04:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
so the uh the seu budget already exists
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
so there's not a lot of administrative
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
work there's not really much more effort
 
04:28:59.929 --> 04:28:59.939 align:start position:0%
the real only thing that would be extra
 
04:29:01.790 --> 04:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
is determining your adjusted budget
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's really the amount of
 
04:29:05.630 --> 04:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
administrative work that would be uh put
 
04:29:07.729 --> 04:29:07.739 align:start position:0%
on saus for doing this if you're a
 
04:29:09.469 --> 04:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
multi-discuit sdu you're already doing
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
the apportion because you have to so
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's there's nothing new there
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh let's see here
 
04:29:19.010 --> 04:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
so there is one oversight that needs to
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
be amended to this bill to deal with the
 
04:29:24.649 --> 04:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
case of the single District SAU and I
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
show it here down under solution
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
um it's 194c
 
04:29:32.689 --> 04:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
colon 3 where we have to add in some
 
04:29:35.090 --> 04:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
language that a single dish if we choose
 
04:29:37.610 --> 04:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
to if you choose to pass this bill and
 
04:29:39.649 --> 04:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
it becomes law it needs to have these
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
this statement here because it needs to
 
04:29:44.689 --> 04:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
say that a single District SAU will have
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
a public hearing on the SAU budget and
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
they will adopt a budget and they will
 
04:29:52.010 --> 04:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
conduct budget voting because right now
 
04:29:53.450 --> 04:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
without that language they would not
 
04:29:55.490 --> 04:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
require and I think you heard that that
 
04:29:58.370 --> 04:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
from the previous speaker
 
04:30:00.769 --> 04:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
so really the main reason we have this
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
is to really give voters a choice
 
04:30:05.809 --> 04:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
and give more visibility to the SAU
 
04:30:07.849 --> 04:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
budget because it's a challenge we have
 
04:30:10.729 --> 04:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
we have a education spending problem and
 
04:30:12.110 --> 04:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
you can see that a lot of it's being
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
driven by administrators they're not
 
04:30:16.149 --> 04:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
doing poorly at all
 
04:30:20.929 --> 04:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
so this gives the the voters in the town
 
04:30:23.630 --> 04:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
in each School District visibility as a
 
04:30:25.490 --> 04:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
separate worn article and also scrutiny
 
04:30:28.010 --> 04:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
and the ability to vote on it so that
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
whether you're in a single District SAU
 
04:30:31.849 --> 04:30:31.859 align:start position:0%
or a multi-district SAU
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
you can vote on your SAU budget and that
 
04:30:37.309 --> 04:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
you have that say and help keep
 
04:30:40.429 --> 04:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
administrative costs under control
 
04:30:43.790 --> 04:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
so I recommend uh Auto pass with the
 
04:30:43.800 --> 04:30:44.870 align:start position:0%
so I recommend uh Auto pass with the
amendment

04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:30:48.170 --> 04:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
otpa on 563 and I'll welcome any
 
04:30:48.180 --> 04:30:49.309 align:start position:0%
otpa on 563 and I'll welcome any
questions

04:30:49.309 --> 04:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions uh representative
 
04:30:52.560 --> 04:30:53.750 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions uh representative
luno

04:30:53.750 --> 04:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
luno
 
04:30:56.330 --> 04:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
um so and thanks for passing this around
 
04:31:01.370 --> 04:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
and I noticed uh in the in the first
 
04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
piece you talk about a report from
 
04:31:06.410 --> 04:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
Hillsdale College presented by presume
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
an administrator the president
 
04:31:10.729 --> 04:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
um there so you know maybe that's a
 
04:31:14.090 --> 04:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
Superfluous position at Hillsdale but
 
04:31:16.250 --> 04:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
but really wanted what I wanted to sort
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
of go after is some of the um the
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
rhetoric that that's been repeated from
 
04:31:26.450 --> 04:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
Ryan Terrell's op-ed piece which which
 
04:31:28.910 --> 04:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
is is was just blatantly incorrect but
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
but at worst misleading
 
04:31:34.490 --> 04:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
um and um and you're signing some
 
04:31:37.250 --> 04:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
statistics here and I just want to ask
 
04:31:39.889 --> 04:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
you when looking at teacher salaries of
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
just one percent over a over a 20-year
 
04:31:46.309 --> 04:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
period I I think that sort of blatantly
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
laughable because I think we've all been
 
04:31:50.330 --> 04:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
through district meetings where where
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreed agreements
 
04:31:55.370 --> 04:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
come up for vote every three four years
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and and so so you know that's
 
04:32:02.210 --> 04:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
that's even even one of those collective
 
04:32:05.090 --> 04:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements at least as far as
 
04:32:07.790 --> 04:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
the salary schedule is concerned would
 
04:32:09.769 --> 04:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
be uh would be more than just one
 
04:32:12.170 --> 04:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
percent let alone over a two decade
 
04:32:17.090 --> 04:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
period but um but the question to um to
 
04:32:20.030 --> 04:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
you would be do you realize that um that
 
04:32:22.429 --> 04:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
not all teachers make the same and that
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
when a teacher towards the end of their
 
04:32:27.889 --> 04:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
career May retire and maybe is replaced
 
04:32:29.689 --> 04:32:29.699 align:start position:0%
by a teacher earlier in their career
 
04:32:32.450 --> 04:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
that that newer teacher may be making
 
04:32:35.149 --> 04:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
less money and would you call that pay
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
be paying teachers
 
04:32:40.729 --> 04:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
more or paying teachers less
 
04:32:42.290 --> 04:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the relevancy of the
 
04:32:44.210 --> 04:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
question to this bill but you know
 
04:32:46.729 --> 04:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
teachers there's a pay scale I'm
 
04:32:48.110 --> 04:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with that I served on the
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
school board so I went through that
 
04:32:51.950 --> 04:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
whole process we have numbers of years
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
of experience and then educational track
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
and they make more money as they get
 
04:32:58.010 --> 04:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
more experience as they move up in
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
education so the years it's a pay table
 
04:33:02.330 --> 04:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
just like the military has Rank and
 
04:33:03.950 --> 04:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
years of service you got educational
 
04:33:07.551 --> 04:33:07.561 align:start position:0%
level and years of service so Public
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
School teachers I don't think are
 
04:33:12.650 --> 04:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
getting as much pay raise in general as
 
04:33:12.660 --> 04:33:14.410 align:start position:0%
getting as much pay raise in general as
administrators

04:33:14.410 --> 04:33:14.420 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
04:33:17.209 --> 04:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
and so you know the purpose of this bill
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
really getting back to what it's about
 
04:33:22.910 --> 04:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
is really to bring visibility to the SAU
 
04:33:22.920 --> 04:33:24.890 align:start position:0%
is really to bring visibility to the SAU
spending

04:33:24.890 --> 04:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
spending
 
04:33:26.929 --> 04:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
um and we we certainly have seen that
 
04:33:29.209 --> 04:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of money that's going on and
 
04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
each School District can determine
 
04:33:35.029 --> 04:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
um what uh is right for their Community
 
04:33:36.890 --> 04:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
to retain their superintendent their
 
04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
business administrator
 
04:33:41.449 --> 04:33:41.459 align:start position:0%
and to be competitive but the point
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
right now is right now it's just the
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
school board that decides that budget
 
04:33:47.090 --> 04:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
the voters don't have any input unless
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
you have adopted this alternative budget
 
04:33:51.709 --> 04:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
procedure and single District saus have
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
no choice so you're leaving it up to the
 
04:33:54.890 --> 04:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
five seven whoever in many school board
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
members are to determine what the
 
04:33:58.910 --> 04:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
administrators are being paid so
 
04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
follow up on that because I think the
 
04:34:02.510 --> 04:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
relevancy of the question was was
 
04:34:02.520 --> 04:34:03.890 align:start position:0%
relevancy of the question was was
challenged

04:34:03.890 --> 04:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
challenged
 
04:34:03.900 --> 04:34:04.609 align:start position:0%
challenged
um

04:34:04.609 --> 04:34:04.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
and uh and obviously you must realize
 
04:34:10.369 --> 04:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
that the uh that the relevant that the
 
04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
the questions relevant because you bring
 
04:34:15.890 --> 04:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
up the comparison of administrator costs
 
04:34:15.900 --> 04:34:16.849 align:start position:0%
up the comparison of administrator costs
versus

04:34:16.849 --> 04:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
versus
 
04:34:18.890 --> 04:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
um versus versus teachers because the
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
question is and so so the um so the the
 
04:34:24.051 --> 04:34:24.061 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:34:27.529 --> 04:34:27.539 align:start position:0%
oh where's the question on on this um
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
and when when looking at the um at at
 
04:34:34.670 --> 04:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
making that comparison uh where would
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
you put
 
04:34:39.949 --> 04:34:39.959 align:start position:0%
um staff such as
 
04:34:39.959 --> 04:34:40.869 align:start position:0%
um staff such as
um

04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:43.189 --> 04:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals school counselors
 
04:34:43.199 --> 04:34:45.349 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals school counselors
Librarians

04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
Librarians
 
04:34:49.131 --> 04:34:49.141 align:start position:0%
um uh as well as where would you where
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
would you categorize uh SAU expenses
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
that might include Debt Service or um or
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh or salary pool and things like that
 
04:35:03.529 --> 04:35:03.539 align:start position:0%
would that be uh on the um on the SAU
 
04:35:07.250 --> 04:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
side or on the school side
 
04:35:11.570 --> 04:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
so sau's cannot own property saus cannot
 
04:35:14.209 --> 04:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
buy property they have to get it by
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
another means so they don't really
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
what's in an SAU is primarily salaries
 
04:35:22.849 --> 04:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
and benefits and some uh so I would say
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure like I.T equipment and
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
such that's about all you're going to
 
04:35:29.929 --> 04:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
see there the Hillsdale College article
 
04:35:31.730 --> 04:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
is actually referencing Department of
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
Education data so that's where that came
 
04:35:34.439 --> 04:35:35.410 align:start position:0%
Education data so that's where that came
from

04:35:35.410 --> 04:35:35.420 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:35:38.810 --> 04:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
so the school districts will have
 
04:35:40.250 --> 04:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
administrators that are in the school
 
04:35:41.869 --> 04:35:41.879 align:start position:0%
districts we're not breaking that out
 
04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
we're just breaking out all of the
 
04:35:47.689 --> 04:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
administrators that are in the SAU
 
04:35:49.970 --> 04:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
and representative miler
 
04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for being here thank
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my questions I'll ask you
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
the same question I asked before how do
 
04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
you define administrative costs
 
04:36:02.029 --> 04:36:02.039 align:start position:0%
what what does administrative costs is
 
04:36:04.970 --> 04:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
what is in the SAU budget line item
 
04:36:04.980 --> 04:36:05.810 align:start position:0%
what is in the SAU budget line item
today

04:36:05.810 --> 04:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
that is that's defined in it's defined
 
04:36:09.650 --> 04:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
on what what the people that are in the
 
04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
SAU and their benefits and their pay
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
administrative costs there are
 
04:36:15.410 --> 04:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
administrative costs that are part of
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
the school districts that's not broken
 
04:36:18.289 --> 04:36:18.299 align:start position:0%
out this is just for the school
 
04:36:20.330 --> 04:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
administrative unit only
 
04:36:23.810 --> 04:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
so follow thank you so you're basically
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
dealing with whatever the administrative
 
04:36:28.250 --> 04:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
salaries are and benefits that's how you
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
define Administration
 
04:36:32.929 --> 04:36:32.939 align:start position:0%
that's the way dra defines anybody
 
04:36:35.209 --> 04:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
that's working for the SAU office that's
 
04:36:37.010 --> 04:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
not that's not a member of this not
 
04:36:38.510 --> 04:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
employed by the school district there is
 
04:36:39.949 --> 04:36:39.959 align:start position:0%
some Provisions for somebody who might
 
04:36:42.051 --> 04:36:42.061 align:start position:0%
be shared between an SAU they might say
 
04:36:44.990 --> 04:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
50 is SAU 50 the Brookline School
 
04:36:46.849 --> 04:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
District then they have to save it that
 
04:36:46.859 --> 04:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
District then they have to save it that
way

04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:36:50.209 --> 04:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony I think
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
you seem to be looking for
 
04:36:59.631 --> 04:36:59.641 align:start position:0%
um information that might guide you to
 
04:37:01.609 --> 04:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
inefficiency of some sort of the result
 
04:37:03.289 --> 04:37:03.299 align:start position:0%
of administrative growth but my question
 
04:37:04.490 --> 04:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:37:07.330 --> 04:37:07.340 align:start position:0%
is if if administrative
 
04:37:09.769 --> 04:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
positions and costs are growing over a
 
04:37:12.349 --> 04:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
period of time do we have any concept of
 
04:37:14.330 --> 04:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
what degree or percentage that might be
 
04:37:18.051 --> 04:37:18.061 align:start position:0%
linked to Federal requirements that are
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
things we have to have in order to
 
04:37:22.369 --> 04:37:22.379 align:start position:0%
receive federal funding
 
04:37:25.369 --> 04:37:25.379 align:start position:0%
that's a good question the uh I'm sure
 
04:37:26.810 --> 04:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
that some of the requirements from the
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
state and federal government is driving
 
04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
the size of the sau's but I think that
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
needs deserves to be scrutinized and
 
04:37:35.330 --> 04:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
I've certainly done that where I live
 
04:37:37.490 --> 04:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
you need to understand why are you
 
04:37:39.650 --> 04:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
adding another administrator you know
 
04:37:41.449 --> 04:37:41.459 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:37:43.970 --> 04:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
where I'm at our SAU
 
04:37:43.980 --> 04:37:45.410 align:start position:0%
where I'm at our SAU
had

04:37:45.410 --> 04:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:37:49.010 --> 04:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
um nine people in it in 2007 and now it
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
has 19. this last count I had now the
 
04:37:54.910 --> 04:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
and the population is down 15
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
so you know and we've we have the we've
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
had the alternative budget procedure for
 
04:38:00.890 --> 04:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
a little bit a little while so I don't
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
know if it might have slowed it down
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
some but at least we have visibility for
 
04:38:08.209 --> 04:38:08.219 align:start position:0%
example they they wanted to hire a
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
compliance specialist and that was part
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
of the the
 
04:38:14.269 --> 04:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
proposed budget and it wasn't in the
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
default budget so anytime they add a
 
04:38:18.289 --> 04:38:18.299 align:start position:0%
person they have to bring it in front of
 
04:38:20.449 --> 04:38:20.459 align:start position:0%
the voters and they have to justify that
 
04:38:22.910 --> 04:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
we need this person because we have some
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
federal program that we have to meet we
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
have some State program we have to meet
 
04:38:28.250 --> 04:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
but the voters get the weigh in on it in
 
04:38:29.869 --> 04:38:29.879 align:start position:0%
ark's case because we have that budget
 
04:38:31.369 --> 04:38:31.379 align:start position:0%
procedure if you're in a single District
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have that choice so that's
 
04:38:36.769 --> 04:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
that's that's the point there follow
 
04:38:38.449 --> 04:38:38.459 align:start position:0%
real quick follow-up if we were to move
 
04:38:39.769 --> 04:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
forward with something like this looking
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
to pull this information out do you
 
04:38:42.650 --> 04:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
think it would be useful for us to also
 
04:38:45.170 --> 04:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
know what percentage of these
 
04:38:47.150 --> 04:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
requirements are being driven by federal
 
04:38:47.160 --> 04:38:48.470 align:start position:0%
requirements are being driven by federal
requirements

04:38:48.470 --> 04:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:38:53.390 --> 04:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.250 --> 04:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just kidding back to the different
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
ways it it seems as though it's already
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
in the statute that multi-town districts
 
04:39:05.209 --> 04:39:05.219 align:start position:0%
can do exactly what your District did so
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
why do we need this if it's already
 
04:39:09.170 --> 04:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
available is this just pertaining to
 
04:39:11.689 --> 04:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
single District
 
04:39:14.631 --> 04:39:14.641 align:start position:0%
good question so adopting this
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
alternative budget procedure is not a
 
04:39:19.369 --> 04:39:19.379 align:start position:0%
trivial matter
 
04:39:19.379 --> 04:39:20.150 align:start position:0%
trivial matter
um

04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:21.890 --> 04:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
citizens had we had to put it on
 
04:39:24.170 --> 04:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
petition in the three school districts
 
04:39:25.609 --> 04:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
and then had to get it approved
 
04:39:27.470 --> 04:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
separately in the in the three school
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
districts and then it became the same
 
04:39:31.131 --> 04:39:31.141 align:start position:0%
year and then it became alternative
 
04:39:32.990 --> 04:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
budget procedure
 
04:39:33.000 --> 04:39:33.830 align:start position:0%
budget procedure
um

04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:35.689 --> 04:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
the school typically the schools
 
04:39:37.970 --> 04:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
typically Administration don't like it
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
because it puts more scrutiny on so they
 
04:39:41.810 --> 04:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
can actually put a warrant article in to
 
04:39:43.630 --> 04:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
rescind it and that's happened
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately unlike some of the other
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
things that we have available with
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
school districts and municipalities like
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
a adopting sb2 or adopting a tax cap
 
04:39:55.970 --> 04:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
which we also have in Brookline
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's a 60 super majority to adopt and
 
04:40:01.970 --> 04:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's a 60 super majority to rescind on
 
04:40:03.770 --> 04:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
both of those unfortunately for this
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
alternative budget procedure it's 50 50
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
so it can go back and forth
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
very easily and it's not really an
 
04:40:12.110 --> 04:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
advantage to the voters and it's
 
04:40:13.788 --> 04:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
happened in Timberlane they had that
 
04:40:15.050 --> 04:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
problem where they had it for one year
 
04:40:17.510 --> 04:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the school administration had the
 
04:40:18.650 --> 04:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
school board put it on and it was
 
04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
rescinded the next year and if you don't
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a singles District SAU has no has
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:29.570 --> 04:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
just follow uh just a quick follow-up um
 
04:40:31.550 --> 04:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
but you keep referencing that the
 
04:40:33.170 --> 04:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
illustrators are making the decisions
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
when it's actually the four might you
 
04:40:36.240 --> 04:40:37.190 align:start position:0%
when it's actually the four might you
know

04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:40:40.190 --> 04:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
um SAU there's four towns with four
 
04:40:42.170 --> 04:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
different school boards that make those
 
04:40:44.208 --> 04:40:44.218 align:start position:0%
decisions correct
 
04:40:46.368 --> 04:40:46.378 align:start position:0%
that's correct so they're influencing
 
04:40:48.050 --> 04:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
the school board but it's it's a matter
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
of semantics so you know rsau governing
 
04:40:52.730 --> 04:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
board has five from Brookline five for
 
04:40:54.288 --> 04:40:54.298 align:start position:0%
Hall of seven from the co-op it's 17
 
04:40:54.298 --> 04:40:56.930 align:start position:0%
Hall of seven from the co-op it's 17
members

04:40:56.930 --> 04:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:58.850 --> 04:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
represent there thank you do you have a
 
04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
commute um citizen budget committee okay
 
04:41:09.230 --> 04:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
we so for the SAU it's a complicated
 
04:41:12.530 --> 04:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
question so uh the co-op has a budget
 
04:41:12.540 --> 04:41:13.610 align:start position:0%
question so uh the co-op has a budget
committee

04:41:13.610 --> 04:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:41:16.490 --> 04:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
the Hollis School District Hollis town
 
04:41:18.050 --> 04:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
has a budget committee Brookline does
 
04:41:20.208 --> 04:41:20.218 align:start position:0%
not we have a finance advisory committee
 
04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
so there's no budget committee that
 
04:41:25.490 --> 04:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
oversees the SAU budget if you're asking
 
04:41:27.948 --> 04:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
that question that it's just a they try
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
to take a couple people they take
 
04:41:31.310 --> 04:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Brookline Finance they
 
04:41:33.170 --> 04:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
take somebody from the co-op budget
 
04:41:34.250 --> 04:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
committee and they take somebody from
 
04:41:37.128 --> 04:41:37.138 align:start position:0%
the hot the the Hollis budget committee
 
04:41:39.708 --> 04:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
and they become an advisor but there's
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
no they just advise on the on the on the
 
04:41:43.970 --> 04:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
SAU budget
 
04:41:46.368 --> 04:41:46.378 align:start position:0%
does it follow yes um I thought you said
 
04:41:49.010 --> 04:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
before one of your intents of this bill
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
was to make
 
04:41:54.890 --> 04:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
the SAU administrative budget more
 
04:41:58.430 --> 04:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
um available to the public and to the
 
04:42:00.650 --> 04:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
voters and
 
04:42:02.470 --> 04:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
um aren't they getting
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
with with the school board and the
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
advisory budget committee so that you do
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
have they could actually
 
04:42:13.730 --> 04:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
decide about the weed it out and see
 
04:42:16.190 --> 04:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
what the administrative budget is and
 
04:42:18.410 --> 04:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
make some recommendations on that I mean
 
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
it isn't like
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
um it's all hidden in the budget nobody
 
04:42:23.390 --> 04:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
ever sees it
 
04:42:25.970 --> 04:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
um it it seems like there's citizens
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
that actually have the ability to see it
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
and and work with it I know on my budget
 
04:42:34.430 --> 04:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
committee we're we're with it for two or
 
04:42:36.948 --> 04:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
three months before it's put before the
 
04:42:39.170 --> 04:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
community so I guess that's my question
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't you think that there's there's uh
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
people that do oversee the budget and
 
04:42:47.330 --> 04:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
the administrative budget as part of the
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
voting public on these budget committees
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
yes so I served on a study committee I
 
04:42:55.970 --> 04:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
was a chair of a study committee look at
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
adopting a budget committee on our in
 
04:42:58.730 --> 04:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
Brookline so I'm very familiar with
 
04:43:00.650 --> 04:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
budget committees we did not ultimately
 
04:43:02.448 --> 04:43:02.458 align:start position:0%
adopt it unfortunately and I still think
 
04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
we need to but the the point is is that
 
04:43:07.490 --> 04:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
there's no real Authority there's
 
04:43:09.530 --> 04:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
advisory Authority for people to look at
 
04:43:11.330 --> 04:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
it and the other challenge is as I
 
04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned the SAU budget is set in
 
04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
December which means they're doing this
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
kind of ahead of everything else and
 
04:43:21.708 --> 04:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
it's decided on I mean I literally it's
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
usually right before Christmas there was
 
04:43:25.190 --> 04:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
two years be two years ago it was
 
04:43:27.650 --> 04:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
between Christmas and New Year's so
 
04:43:30.410 --> 04:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
there isn't the highest uh
 
04:43:33.288 --> 04:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
availability of Voters they're not in
 
04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
the mode of looking at budgets there's
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
just a few people on the budget
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee and it's an ad hoc thing so
 
04:43:41.030 --> 04:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's not doesn't have the same scrutiny
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
but I you know in ours I've had the
 
04:43:45.650 --> 04:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
benefit of having this budget procedure
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
so I've seen others that I've talked to
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
that they have to go dig for the SAU
 
04:43:52.250 --> 04:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
budget it gets apportioned and then it
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
becomes a line item and they have no say
 
04:43:57.708 --> 04:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
they do not have any ability to have an
 
04:44:00.650 --> 04:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
adjusted budget and single District su's
 
04:44:02.090 --> 04:44:02.100 align:start position:0%
have no choice at all they just leave it
 
04:44:05.330 --> 04:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the school board and the
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
budget committee can weigh in on it but
 
04:44:10.510 --> 04:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay and and don't they have a public
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on this where all those
 
04:44:19.010 --> 04:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
information comes out in spreadsheets
 
04:44:20.810 --> 04:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
I don't believe a single District SCU
 
04:44:22.128 --> 04:44:22.138 align:start position:0%
has to have a hearing they're exempt
 
04:44:24.410 --> 04:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
from it for the RSA right now the
 
04:44:26.208 --> 04:44:26.218 align:start position:0%
multi-district sau's do have to have a
 
04:44:29.208 --> 04:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
hearing even if they're an sb2 town
 
04:44:31.128 --> 04:44:31.138 align:start position:0%
even if they're an sb2 town because this
 
04:44:32.930 --> 04:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
is this is regardless whether you have
 
04:44:35.090 --> 04:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
an SB well sb2
 
04:44:36.770 --> 04:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
is really the wrong term because you
 
04:44:38.750 --> 04:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
have multi-districts so there may be a
 
04:44:41.330 --> 04:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
mix of sb2 and traditional it doesn't
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
matter whether it's SP2 or traditional
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
and some seus have a mix like we do it's
 
04:44:47.040 --> 04:44:47.930 align:start position:0%
and some seus have a mix like we do it's
really

04:44:47.930 --> 04:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:44:50.390 --> 04:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
um it's just a hearing and then that
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
governing board makes the decision on a
 
04:44:55.550 --> 04:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
proposed budget and an adjusted budget
 
04:44:56.930 --> 04:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
if they have the alternative budget
 
04:44:58.730 --> 04:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
procedure if you don't have that
 
04:45:00.288 --> 04:45:00.298 align:start position:0%
current state of affairs is they just
 
04:45:01.788 --> 04:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
set a budget and it is what it is and no
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
one can change it after that but just as
 
04:45:06.890 --> 04:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
a problem but you can still you can
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
still get that information any any voter
 
04:45:11.628 --> 04:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
could get that information
 
04:45:13.730 --> 04:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
if the voters diligent enough they can
 
04:45:15.530 --> 04:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
look for it and they can find it it's
 
04:45:17.208 --> 04:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
not easy though I just looked in the
 
04:45:18.770 --> 04:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
Nashua website trying to find the SAU
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
budget and I couldn't find it
 
04:45:23.448 --> 04:45:23.458 align:start position:0%
single District SAU representative
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
Ellison uh thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
taking Mike two quick questions I'm
 
04:45:29.868 --> 04:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify I think I heard you
 
04:45:33.170 --> 04:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
say that voters have no say in setting
 
04:45:35.930 --> 04:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
the SAU administrative budget is that in
 
04:45:38.208 --> 04:45:38.218 align:start position:0%
my am I quoting you correctly they have
 
04:45:40.670 --> 04:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
no direct say in that they don't vote on
 
04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
it unless they have the alternative
 
04:45:44.990 --> 04:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
budget procedure okay second question uh
 
04:45:46.610 --> 04:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
how do people get on the school board
 
04:45:51.410 --> 04:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:55.128 --> 04:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:57.650 --> 04:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
perhaps and leckis
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:46:03.050 --> 04:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
um I know when that report first came
 
04:46:05.570 --> 04:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
out and I was wondering what all does
 
04:46:09.530 --> 04:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
who all is an administrator and I ask
 
04:46:11.750 --> 04:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
um that question and I said well and I
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
what I was told was well depends upon
 
04:46:17.150 --> 04:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
how that school district qualifies them
 
04:46:19.010 --> 04:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
for instance we have a community
 
04:46:21.530 --> 04:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
outreach person it's that Administration
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
you know and so how it says some things
 
04:46:28.610 --> 04:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
and it says teacher Consultants
 
04:46:30.830 --> 04:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
what would be teacher Consultants with
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
the Dei person be a teacher consultant
 
04:46:35.448 --> 04:46:35.458 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering how that's determined
 
04:46:38.270 --> 04:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
or if it's just these specific things
 
04:46:40.730 --> 04:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
that you have written down here
 
04:46:42.650 --> 04:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
so the question is you know what
 
04:46:45.170 --> 04:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
qualifies as an SAU
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
um expense and that's not really
 
04:46:49.430 --> 04:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
changing in this bill because that word
 
04:46:52.090 --> 04:46:52.100 align:start position:0%
is addressing how it gets voted on
 
04:46:52.100 --> 04:46:53.930 align:start position:0%
is addressing how it gets voted on
but

04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:46:56.690 --> 04:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
some areas are very distinct it's clear
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
a business administrator a special ed
 
04:47:00.230 --> 04:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
director superintendent assistant
 
04:47:02.930 --> 04:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
superintendent those are all
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the SAU office
 
04:47:06.890 --> 04:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
then you get to some other things that
 
04:47:09.890 --> 04:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
are in the gray area we had uh two years
 
04:47:12.530 --> 04:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
ago we voted on a Communications and
 
04:47:14.570 --> 04:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
compliance specialist that was going to
 
04:47:16.250 --> 04:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
monitor social media
 
04:47:18.850 --> 04:47:18.860 align:start position:0%
was going to help with right to knows
 
04:47:21.410 --> 04:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
and it was a close vote but the the
 
04:47:23.330 --> 04:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
voters between the three towns approved
 
04:47:25.128 --> 04:47:25.138 align:start position:0%
it and that but they decided to put that
 
04:47:28.490 --> 04:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
in the SAU that's really a a board
 
04:47:30.288 --> 04:47:30.298 align:start position:0%
decision on each of the boards that make
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
up the SAU if it's a multi-district
 
04:47:35.628 --> 04:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
where you put them and I believe the
 
04:47:37.730 --> 04:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
subject of this particular bill this is
 
04:47:39.470 --> 04:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
just voting really how you vote on it
 
04:47:43.070 --> 04:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:45.708 --> 04:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
04:47:47.330 --> 04:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:47:49.128 --> 04:47:49.138 align:start position:0%
my question it's the same one I asked
 
04:47:51.530 --> 04:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
earlier about the speaker uh didn't know
 
04:47:53.930 --> 04:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
the answer so
 
04:47:58.430 --> 04:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
multiple towns vote differently some
 
04:48:00.288 --> 04:48:00.298 align:start position:0%
If This Were to go through
 
04:48:02.510 --> 04:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
some say yes to the new budget some say
 
04:48:04.730 --> 04:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
yes to the default budget then how is
 
04:48:06.410 --> 04:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
the SAU funded
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
so that's a good question so
 
04:48:11.770 --> 04:48:11.780 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before every
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
say in my example we have Hollis
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
Brookline and the co-op
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
and yes no vote is conducted in the
 
04:48:20.570 --> 04:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
co-op they count the ballots they report
 
04:48:22.490 --> 04:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
them to the next meeting
 
04:48:24.770 --> 04:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
Brookline votes sb2 we count those
 
04:48:27.050 --> 04:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
ballots that they get added in Hollis
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
has their district meeting if they're
 
04:48:30.830 --> 04:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
the last one for example they count the
 
04:48:33.288 --> 04:48:33.298 align:start position:0%
yeses and the no's who's ever at the
 
04:48:35.150 --> 04:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
meeting and the yes if the yeses are
 
04:48:38.270 --> 04:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
more it's not if Brookline passes it and
 
04:48:41.090 --> 04:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
the co-op doesn't and Hollis does it's
 
04:48:42.530 --> 04:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
just the total that's the way it is
 
04:48:43.610 --> 04:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
today in the alternative budget
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
procedure the the alternative budget
 
04:48:47.570 --> 04:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
procedure is not changed that's as part
 
04:48:49.250 --> 04:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
as part of this bill that's what exists
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
today it's just a tally of the S's and
 
04:48:54.288 --> 04:48:54.298 align:start position:0%
the no's and that's how it works thank
 
04:48:57.230 --> 04:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
you are there further questions
 
04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:49:02.270 --> 04:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh is there any technical support we can
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
get uh Barrett
 
04:49:08.090 --> 04:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
on some of this discussion so that we're
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
 
04:49:13.910 --> 04:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:18.730 --> 04:49:18.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:21.890 --> 04:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
those can be one of the same
 
04:49:21.900 --> 04:49:24.730 align:start position:0%
those can be one of the same
um

04:49:24.730 --> 04:49:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.770 --> 04:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
the statement that that
 
04:49:30.050 --> 04:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
okay let's put
 
04:49:33.470 --> 04:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
a single District saus do not they have
 
04:49:35.810 --> 04:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
an SAU number that's assigned by the
 
04:49:37.368 --> 04:49:37.378 align:start position:0%
Department of Education there is no
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
separate SAU office an SAU in a single
 
04:49:43.970 --> 04:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
District SAU what would otherwise be
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
your SAU staff your superintendent your
 
04:49:48.970 --> 04:49:48.980 align:start position:0%
special ed director assistant
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
superintendent B.A
 
04:49:55.070 --> 04:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
admin assistance those are School
 
04:49:57.650 --> 04:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
District employees all right those are
 
04:49:59.570 --> 04:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
School District employees I'm going to
 
04:50:01.010 --> 04:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
use SAE I'm going to use representative
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
halls I say you because it's the
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
simplest form SAU 67 bow and Dunbarton
 
04:50:09.050 --> 04:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
two school districts sharing
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
administrative services that
 
04:50:13.490 --> 04:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
superintendent is not an employee of the
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
boat School District that student
 
04:50:16.730 --> 04:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
superintendent is not an employee of the
 
04:50:19.490 --> 04:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
donbats Don Barton School District that
 
04:50:23.510 --> 04:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent is an employee of of SAU
 
04:50:27.050 --> 04:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
67 I believe the number is right two
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
school districts forming together to
 
04:50:31.670 --> 04:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
create another political entity at least
 
04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
her right to know law purposes budgeting
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
purposes things of that nature there was
 
04:50:37.970 --> 04:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
also a comment that a single District
 
04:50:41.090 --> 04:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
SAU that you you you can't pull out the
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
administrative services that or there's
 
04:50:45.288 --> 04:50:45.298 align:start position:0%
no opportunity for the public to to
 
04:50:48.070 --> 04:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
participate or something a lot or
 
04:50:50.330 --> 04:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
every school district whether or not
 
04:50:52.310 --> 04:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
you're a co-op a single School School
 
04:50:54.890 --> 04:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
District a single School District SAU
 
04:50:57.970 --> 04:50:57.980 align:start position:0%
and a co-op multiple uh
 
04:51:00.890 --> 04:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
SAU town you have to have a budget
 
04:51:03.530 --> 04:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
hearing under RSA 32.
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the public has a right to comment on
 
04:51:07.368 --> 04:51:07.378 align:start position:0%
that budget I'm looking at the
 
04:51:08.930 --> 04:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I'm sorry the
 
04:51:11.390 --> 04:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration the
 
04:51:13.690 --> 04:51:13.700 align:start position:0%

04:51:53.810 --> 04:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
if you want to know how much
 
04:51:56.690 --> 04:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
superintendent is making you call the
 
04:51:59.930 --> 04:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
SAU and ask the other aspect too is
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
we've got to be be clear that if we're
 
04:52:04.128 --> 04:52:04.138 align:start position:0%
talking about a single District SAU we
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
need to Define what administration is
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
because your principles are
 
04:52:11.628 --> 04:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
administrators they are not part of your
 
04:52:13.610 --> 04:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
SAU though they are not part of your
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
central office with your superintendent
 
04:52:17.330 --> 04:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
and your business manager and your
 
04:52:19.310 --> 04:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
special ed director they're employees of
 
04:52:21.530 --> 04:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
the district Beau High School has a
 
04:52:24.770 --> 04:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
principal not an SAU employee Don Barton
 
04:52:25.970 --> 04:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
Elementary School or whatever it's
 
04:52:27.230 --> 04:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
called has an elementary school
 
04:52:30.288 --> 04:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
principal not an SAU employee
 
04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
and one other aside if we're worried
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
about having too many administrators
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lakers has a bill that's
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
going to require districts hire five
 
04:52:41.810 --> 04:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
more administrators to implement those
 
04:52:43.070 --> 04:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
Improvement plans we're going to need
 
04:52:44.690 --> 04:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
curriculum coordinators and other
 
04:52:46.070 --> 04:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent and two more
 
04:52:48.650 --> 04:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
principals just to get through it so I
 
04:52:51.890 --> 04:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
don't the the notion that I mean first
 
04:52:53.330 --> 04:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
of all the whole single District SAU
 
04:52:55.490 --> 04:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
multi-district SAU I talked about that
 
04:52:57.288 --> 04:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
but just because you're in a single
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
District SAU doesn't mean the voters
 
04:53:00.170 --> 04:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
don't have the opportunity to look at
 
04:53:01.250 --> 04:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
the money
 
04:53:03.230 --> 04:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's all public life that you file a
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
right to know law requests look at the
 
04:53:07.128 --> 04:53:07.138 align:start position:0%
dra forms go to the budget hearing ask
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
your business manager ask your school
 
04:53:10.550 --> 04:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
board chair for this data and
 
04:53:10.560 --> 04:53:13.930 align:start position:0%
board chair for this data and
information

04:53:13.930 --> 04:53:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:16.490 --> 04:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:53:19.010 --> 04:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for my tone I apologize but it
 
04:53:23.448 --> 04:53:23.458 align:start position:0%
just it it you know I apologize for my
 
04:53:26.090 --> 04:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
tone but thank you for indulging me
 
04:53:28.128 --> 04:53:28.138 align:start position:0%
well we appreciate the information
 
04:53:30.650 --> 04:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli thank you but I
 
04:53:32.930 --> 04:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
think the sponsors
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
um uh intent was to make it a separate

Tanner this may be a comment that having
 
04:55:46.670 --> 04:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
been on the budget committee if we asked

04:56:01.430 --> 04:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
budget Committee Member or as a school
 
04:56:04.730 --> 04:56:04.740 align:start position:0%

Town Hall and this is under RSA 32. uh
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
are you are you are you sb2 or two you
 
04:56:23.868 --> 04:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
must be traditional no we're traditional
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay traditional so it's the it's yeah
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
right and I'm looking at the um at the
 
04:56:31.190 --> 04:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
the budget packet
 
04:56:35.150 --> 04:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
that that the superintendent puts out
 
04:56:38.150 --> 04:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it's about 50 pages long
 
04:56:40.730 --> 04:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
and everybody Picks Them Up I know on
 
04:56:42.288 --> 04:56:42.298 align:start position:0%
the board for a thousand years so I know
 
04:56:44.690 --> 04:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
that everybody picks picks them up in
 
04:56:45.948 --> 04:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
the and the meeting's pretty well
 
04:56:49.250 --> 04:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
intended and towards the you know it
 
04:56:51.410 --> 04:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
sort of starts with the big departments
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
and goes down to the smaller groups and
 
04:56:55.970 --> 04:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
um sort of getting towards the end
 
04:56:58.010 --> 04:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
administrative Services office of the
 
04:56:58.020 --> 04:56:59.690 align:start position:0%
administrative Services office of the
superintendent

04:56:59.690 --> 04:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
04:57:05.690 --> 04:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
um uh 23 20 23 32 25 10 25 11 25 15 I
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
think right account numbers that are
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
common in all district breaks it breaks
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
it right well I guess this is a would
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
you believe
 
04:57:15.770 --> 04:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
um breaks it breaks it right out so
 
04:57:18.288 --> 04:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
voters can see so in harmony
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
um you wouldn't need to do a 91a request
 
04:57:22.970 --> 04:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
that's right it's
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
excuse me it's right there that's the
 
04:57:26.090 --> 04:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
proper way to do it so that's what we
 
04:57:27.470 --> 04:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
would advise our school boards to do
 
04:57:29.810 --> 04:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
right that was the question do you
 
04:57:32.690 --> 04:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
advise school boards to do that we do
 
04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%

from Haverhill which is a single Town
 
04:59:20.810 --> 04:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
Co-op in a multiple SAU and
 
04:59:24.230 --> 04:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's really different
 
04:59:27.110 --> 04:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
um 452 is a bill relative to the
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Education procedures for
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
school building Aid applications we
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
previously had this year a bill that
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
dealt with the dollar amount allocated
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
for new construction as you remember our
 
04:59:41.690 --> 04:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
renovation projects you recall that was
 
04:59:44.690 --> 04:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars on top of the debt
 
04:59:47.448 --> 04:59:47.458 align:start position:0%
then we had a bill come in which dealt
 
04:59:50.330 --> 04:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
with the 10-year plan and encouraging
 
04:59:53.090 --> 04:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
districts to put forward their where
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
they're going with building construction
 
04:59:58.030 --> 04:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
or requests for building a renovation
 
05:00:01.730 --> 05:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
projects so that we as a legislature can
 
05:00:03.890 --> 05:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
better prioritize and plan for our
 
05:00:06.770 --> 05:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
future in terms of appropriating dollars
 
05:00:10.368 --> 05:00:10.378 align:start position:0%
this portion right here is really the I
 
05:00:13.010 --> 05:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
would say the guts of school building
 
05:00:16.610 --> 05:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
Aid and if you have your um
 
05:00:19.610 --> 05:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh bill in front of you let's take a
 
05:00:22.850 --> 05:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
walk through it so that rather than uh
 
05:00:24.650 --> 05:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
trying to read something I'd like to
 
05:00:27.230 --> 05:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
just walk through and and take you
 
05:00:29.330 --> 05:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
through it the way we work with school
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
building Aid is that the state provides
 
05:00:37.550 --> 05:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
support and depending upon the the
 
05:00:40.128 --> 05:00:40.138 align:start position:0%
various conditions within that
 
05:00:42.050 --> 05:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
particular town you might get 30 percent
 
05:00:46.128 --> 05:00:46.138 align:start position:0%
State support you may get 60 percent but
 
05:00:48.410 --> 05:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
when you receive your money the grant
 
05:00:50.510 --> 05:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's awarded to your town you will
 
05:00:53.330 --> 05:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
receive 80 percent of that dollar and
 
05:00:55.368 --> 05:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
that's right there on line 10 on page
 
05:00:58.910 --> 05:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
one you'll receive 80 percent right out
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
of the shoot and upon you're getting
 
05:01:06.350 --> 05:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
towards our upon completion of the
 
05:01:09.650 --> 05:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
construction and verification that it's
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's done the way it's supposed to
 
05:01:14.090 --> 05:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
been done by the department then you get
 
05:01:16.490 --> 05:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
your other 20 of the Grant from the
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
state state
 
05:01:19.850 --> 05:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
and we know right now there's been what
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
three grants approved tentatively until
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
dollars are available and all that we
 
05:01:26.990 --> 05:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
were looking at Rochester we're looking
 
05:01:28.250 --> 05:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
at Colebrook and looking at the
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
Monadnock area
 
05:01:34.490 --> 05:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
going down on line 16 you can see in the
 
05:01:37.368 --> 05:01:37.378 align:start position:0%
application process that if you have
 
05:01:40.190 --> 05:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
received other other dollars for this
 
05:01:43.970 --> 05:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
outside of uh the grant or outside of
 
05:01:45.708 --> 05:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
what you're appropriating locally like a
 
05:01:47.510 --> 05:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
charitable trust a bequest I guess
 
05:01:49.910 --> 05:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
insurance policies and I I did receive
 
05:01:51.530 --> 05:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
that when I was a school principal over
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
in in Maine where I received a
 
05:01:58.070 --> 05:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous gift a petroleum company a
 
05:01:59.770 --> 05:01:59.780 align:start position:0%
person died and gave us all the stock
 
05:02:03.350 --> 05:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
and and that was a real benefit for a
 
05:02:06.590 --> 05:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
small town like Belgrade Maine
 
05:02:10.310 --> 05:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
um going on down to uh line 19 you can
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
see where it says eligible construction
 
05:02:14.090 --> 05:02:14.100 align:start position:0%
projects shall mean project designed to
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
be energy efficient that's a a critical
 
05:02:20.868 --> 05:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
need that we uh have not always had in
 
05:02:22.610 --> 05:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
our legislation looking at Energy
 
05:02:24.830 --> 05:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
Efficiency so that we really are
 
05:02:28.128 --> 05:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
encouraging the the the savings of
 
05:02:30.110 --> 05:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
dollars as you operate your building
 
05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
05:02:35.448 --> 05:02:35.458 align:start position:0%
um going down uh eligible areas that
 
05:02:37.610 --> 05:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
your money may be used for are there on
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
lines 22 down through lines 30 on that
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
first page it's for the acquisition of
 
05:02:45.890 --> 05:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
property and I I know that Amy Clark's
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
here and she can describe that a little
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
bit more for you when we get in there
 
05:02:51.550 --> 05:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
but the acquisition of property the the
 
05:02:53.930 --> 05:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
existing building is whether you're
 
05:02:56.208 --> 05:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
going to renovate it or if you're going
 
05:02:58.010 --> 05:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
to do substantial renovations to a
 
05:02:58.020 --> 05:02:59.270 align:start position:0%
to do substantial renovations to a
project

05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:02:59.280 --> 05:03:00.470 align:start position:0%
project
um

05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:02.330 --> 05:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
Etc it's all right there it also gets
 
05:03:05.090 --> 05:03:05.100 align:start position:0%
into a lease purchase of materials
 
05:03:06.650 --> 05:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
whether you're getting into mechanical
 
05:03:10.550 --> 05:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
structural things HVAC and if you don't
 
05:03:12.830 --> 05:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
cough up the dollars or support that as
 
05:03:14.330 --> 05:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
you're getting the project on page two
 
05:03:16.368 --> 05:03:16.378 align:start position:0%
you can see that the vendor can take
 
05:03:18.650 --> 05:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
that back
 
05:03:22.010 --> 05:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
um on line seven we're talking about
 
05:03:24.350 --> 05:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
um the department shell issue annually
 
05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
maximum eligible cost standards some
 
05:03:28.610 --> 05:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
people have asked me what are the
 
05:03:31.788 --> 05:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
standards that go behind uh this the the
 
05:03:34.368 --> 05:03:34.378 align:start position:0%
size of the building this size the
 
05:03:38.448 --> 05:03:38.458 align:start position:0%
property the location all that yes these
 
05:03:41.208 --> 05:03:41.218 align:start position:0%
are standards and Amy will talk about
 
05:03:43.550 --> 05:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
that she's the engineer she knows how
 
05:03:46.070 --> 05:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
the update this information on an annual
 
05:03:48.890 --> 05:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
basis is based on I believe national
 
05:03:48.900 --> 05:03:50.570 align:start position:0%
basis is based on I believe national
standards

05:03:50.570 --> 05:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
going on down further here you can see
 
05:03:57.708 --> 05:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
let's see um when you're looking at the
 
05:03:59.330 --> 05:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
size of standards and construction of
 
05:04:02.150 --> 05:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
buildings we take into account when we
 
05:04:05.208 --> 05:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
talk about the the area uh the maximum
 
05:04:07.788 --> 05:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
growth square footage per pupil that is
 
05:04:09.650 --> 05:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
specified in the standard
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
and there are some school districts want
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
to come and build the Taj Mahal and
 
05:04:17.690 --> 05:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get you know that
 
05:04:19.730 --> 05:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
money for their their huge building
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to get it according to the
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
standards up to that certain point then
 
05:04:25.128 --> 05:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
they want to go beyond and that they
 
05:04:28.190 --> 05:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
want to have a a 600 seat theater with
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
Orchestra pit and all that in
 
05:04:33.730 --> 05:04:33.740 align:start position:0%
which I had in Alaska brand new building
 
05:04:37.250 --> 05:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
and and uh but uh they're gonna have to
 
05:04:39.650 --> 05:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
pay for that themselves we have 52 drops
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
on stage as well so it was a huge huge
 
05:04:44.750 --> 05:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
Community Building
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
um going down the the commissioner of
 
05:04:49.550 --> 05:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education can waive
 
05:04:50.990 --> 05:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
some of these based upon certain
 
05:04:55.970 --> 05:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
conditions uh that's on lines 3132
 
05:04:55.980 --> 05:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
conditions uh that's on lines 3132
um

05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:00.530 --> 05:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
going on yes the approval of plans
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
specifications and cost construction
 
05:05:02.160 --> 05:05:04.010 align:start position:0%
specifications and cost construction
purchase

05:05:04.010 --> 05:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
05:05:04.020 --> 05:05:04.990 align:start position:0%
purchase
um

05:05:04.990 --> 05:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:08.628 --> 05:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
the the district will definitely look at
 
05:05:11.288 --> 05:05:11.298 align:start position:0%
your your uh site plan in terms of
 
05:05:14.810 --> 05:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
schematic design the the department I
 
05:05:17.690 --> 05:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
mean the cost estimates and other items
 
05:05:20.030 --> 05:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
that are maybe it needs to know in this
 
05:05:21.470 --> 05:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
application maybe like what's your
 
05:05:23.208 --> 05:05:23.218 align:start position:0%
demographic population looking like it's
 
05:05:24.770 --> 05:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
going up is it down you're projecting
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
where that's going to be
 
05:05:28.970 --> 05:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
um those are the challenges that you
 
05:05:30.410 --> 05:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
have to be prepared to answer in your
 
05:05:33.890 --> 05:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
application going on a page three
 
05:05:37.070 --> 05:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh there's a timeline which the timeline
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
which we've had right now has been very
 
05:05:42.050 --> 05:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
very difficult for for the Department to
 
05:05:45.288 --> 05:05:45.298 align:start position:0%
really scrutinize these applications in
 
05:05:47.628 --> 05:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
a way that it's it gives them the time
 
05:05:50.930 --> 05:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
to uh do what's necessary to get out in
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
the field to ask the questions see the
 
05:05:53.280 --> 05:05:54.830 align:start position:0%
the field to ask the questions see the
facility

05:05:54.830 --> 05:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:05:56.990 --> 05:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
um and then go from where they get the
 
05:05:59.208 --> 05:05:59.218 align:start position:0%
they receive this application they are
 
05:06:00.770 --> 05:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
expected to rank order these
 
05:06:03.890 --> 05:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
applications in terms of the criteria
 
05:06:05.750 --> 05:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the standards which we have the
 
05:06:05.760 --> 05:06:07.070 align:start position:0%
and the standards which we have the
criteria

05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
05:06:09.948 --> 05:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
and once they've done that and they've
 
05:06:11.570 --> 05:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
looked at things like the mechanical
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
electrical Plumbing structural
 
05:06:14.930 --> 05:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
components of the building proof of
 
05:06:17.208 --> 05:06:17.218 align:start position:0%
annual school budget to support good
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
maintenance and
 
05:06:21.050 --> 05:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
it would go on the rank order sheet
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
would go on to the school building
 
05:06:24.948 --> 05:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
authority now School building authority
 
05:06:29.448 --> 05:06:29.458 align:start position:0%
is a an organ we've had that in statute
 
05:06:31.550 --> 05:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
for a long time it was not initially set
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
up to do this particular task of
 
05:06:36.650 --> 05:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
checking out and looking at these ranked
 
05:06:39.470 --> 05:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
order applications that come to them it
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
was initially set up to see if the
 
05:06:42.350 --> 05:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
bonding power of the state was there
 
05:06:44.390 --> 05:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
whether the finances of the school
 
05:06:46.250 --> 05:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
district are there to support what
 
05:06:47.690 --> 05:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
they're obligating themselves to get
 
05:06:50.208 --> 05:06:50.218 align:start position:0%
into the school building authority in
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
the case of reviews is there's three
 
05:06:54.948 --> 05:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
people on this this Authority appointed
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
by the governor one is uh you has to be
 
05:07:00.830 --> 05:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
somebody that deals with engineering and
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
knows buildings Architects Etc another
 
05:07:06.890 --> 05:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
person has to be an education oriented
 
05:07:08.990 --> 05:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
person has understanding of policy needs
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
curricular instructional needs within
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
the schools the other person has to be a
 
05:07:15.708 --> 05:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
understanding of Finance you might get
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
somebody that's a really an account or
 
05:07:20.690 --> 05:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
somebody that knows uh dollars the other
 
05:07:22.970 --> 05:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
three people on the uh the the school
 
05:07:24.170 --> 05:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
building authority are the state
 
05:07:24.180 --> 05:07:25.310 align:start position:0%
building authority are the state
treasurer

05:07:25.310 --> 05:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
05:07:29.030 --> 05:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education and the
 
05:07:30.830 --> 05:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
fire marshal or the Fire Marshal's
 
05:07:30.840 --> 05:07:33.368 align:start position:0%
fire marshal or the Fire Marshal's
designee

05:07:33.368 --> 05:07:33.378 align:start position:0%
designee
 
05:07:36.890 --> 05:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
uh so the timeline I'm going to let Amy
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
get in the timeline a little bit because
 
05:07:40.368 --> 05:07:40.378 align:start position:0%
we used to have the applications come in
 
05:07:43.850 --> 05:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
on one July and we had to have them out
 
05:07:46.010 --> 05:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
through this through the rank order
 
05:07:49.310 --> 05:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
process by the department to the school
 
05:07:50.930 --> 05:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
of building authority which would look
 
05:07:52.970 --> 05:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
at that they had the they had the
 
05:07:55.610 --> 05:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
ability to re-re-rank the applications
 
05:07:58.430 --> 05:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
came from the doe if they use the same
 
05:08:01.970 --> 05:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
criteria as the doe had used
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
and that's an area that has been an area
 
05:08:06.410 --> 05:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
of discussion here for the last couple
 
05:08:09.288 --> 05:08:09.298 align:start position:0%
years is that they come all ranked
 
05:08:10.730 --> 05:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
ordered from the Department the
 
05:08:14.090 --> 05:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
application there and then the other
 
05:08:16.250 --> 05:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
group sometimes wants to rank or based
 
05:08:18.288 --> 05:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
on different criteria
 
05:08:21.708 --> 05:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
um so that's an area where where we are
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
looking at I would say we have to have
 
05:08:26.448 --> 05:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
the same criteria these the school
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
building authority can should look at
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
the bonding ability and the finances yes
 
05:08:33.650 --> 05:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
once it comes back from the school
 
05:08:34.970 --> 05:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
building authority and if everything
 
05:08:36.650 --> 05:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
checks out it goes to the State Board of
 
05:08:40.610 --> 05:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
Education for approval so July 1 had to
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
be out in the hands of people are
 
05:08:43.910 --> 05:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
receiving notice that they had an
 
05:08:45.170 --> 05:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
application that's going to be approved
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
by January 15th you can see that's a
 
05:08:49.368 --> 05:08:49.378 align:start position:0%
very short time frame in there
 
05:08:51.350 --> 05:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
especially when Christmas vacations in
 
05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
there it's just impossible to do this
 
05:08:56.930 --> 05:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
properly so Amy has suggested and the
 
05:08:59.330 --> 05:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
department start to put this timeline
 
05:09:01.250 --> 05:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
further out I'll let her get into the
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
explanation of that
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh you can see on page four there the
 
05:09:07.730 --> 05:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the Department of
 
05:09:09.230 --> 05:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
Education shall accept School building
 
05:09:10.970 --> 05:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
construction proposals based upon
 
05:09:13.490 --> 05:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
completeness when that application comes
 
05:09:15.470 --> 05:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
in and these are some of the the
 
05:09:18.170 --> 05:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
conditions which are looked at from one
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
through nine there so on page four those
 
05:09:22.510 --> 05:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
are the conditions we're looking for
 
05:09:25.730 --> 05:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
notice that there are some uh like
 
05:09:28.250 --> 05:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
condition seven we put that in most
 
05:09:29.990 --> 05:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
recently looking at the project
 
05:09:31.670 --> 05:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
contributes to operational cost
 
05:09:31.680 --> 05:09:33.128 align:start position:0%
contributes to operational cost
efficiencies

05:09:33.128 --> 05:09:33.138 align:start position:0%
efficiencies
 
05:09:37.850 --> 05:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
consolidation and reduced property taxes
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
we used to have years ago a five percent
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
increase for skill building Aid if you
 
05:09:46.190 --> 05:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
got high performance
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
um uh projects in your building high
 
05:09:51.050 --> 05:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
performance in terms of saving energy
 
05:09:53.448 --> 05:09:53.458 align:start position:0%
um and and saving the dollar that came
 
05:09:55.730 --> 05:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
out but this this report right here this
 
05:09:57.830 --> 05:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill right here still is looking at high
 
05:09:59.628 --> 05:09:59.638 align:start position:0%
performance and seeing that as a vital
 
05:10:02.030 --> 05:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
area when we rank order these each one
 
05:10:04.250 --> 05:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
of these areas has a number of points
 
05:10:06.410 --> 05:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
and the point systems added up and
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's so it's not very it's not a
 
05:10:11.330 --> 05:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
subjective process of which well I think
 
05:10:13.550 --> 05:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
that this school a is a little bit
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
better than D down here selling them
 
05:10:18.288 --> 05:10:18.298 align:start position:0%
it's not based on that it's based on
 
05:10:20.690 --> 05:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
this understanding of where they are in
 
05:10:22.610 --> 05:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
terms of these and some of these get
 
05:10:24.170 --> 05:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
more points for example health and
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
safety Fire Marshal issues would rise to
 
05:10:28.850 --> 05:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
the top security issues help raise the
 
05:10:31.010 --> 05:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
top although we have been able to help
 
05:10:32.868 --> 05:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
with the public school infrastructure
 
05:10:36.230 --> 05:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
fun money funny funding to to address
 
05:10:37.788 --> 05:10:37.798 align:start position:0%
some of those issues in a separate
 
05:10:40.730 --> 05:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
imaginary area
 
05:10:40.740 --> 05:10:41.390 align:start position:0%
imaginary area
um

05:10:41.390 --> 05:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:44.390 --> 05:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
going down to the bottom part on this
 
05:10:46.330 --> 05:10:46.340 align:start position:0%
page four here
 
05:10:48.410 --> 05:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
applications with substantial
 
05:10:50.208 --> 05:10:50.218 align:start position:0%
deficiencies as defined by the
 
05:10:51.470 --> 05:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education School
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
construction rules may be ranked ahead
 
05:10:55.310 --> 05:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
of applications received at the prior
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
05:10:58.970 --> 05:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
that has happened we've had some come in
 
05:11:00.530 --> 05:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
here that haven't been ranked but have
 
05:11:02.690 --> 05:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
real substantial issues that need to
 
05:11:05.090 --> 05:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
jump ahead of
 
05:11:08.090 --> 05:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
this whole process right here is that so
 
05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
we award these grants out in year one of
 
05:11:12.050 --> 05:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
the biennium the second year
 
05:11:15.050 --> 05:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
or the do we let projects in the second
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
year jump ahead of those which were on
 
05:11:18.890 --> 05:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
the list for the first year
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
and there is a question which we asked
 
05:11:24.110 --> 05:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:11:26.930 --> 05:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
um or just the order that was on that
 
05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
first let's stay like that and you can't
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
jump unless you have this real
 
05:11:33.410 --> 05:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
substantial issue to jump ahead of
 
05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
05:11:37.430 --> 05:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
um there again this is a topic which
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
we've had to really look at and I let
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
the department answer some of the things
 
05:11:44.030 --> 05:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
right there the last part I'd like to
 
05:11:47.270 --> 05:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
address in page 34 of page four
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
we used to have
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
um the project start and we had the
 
05:11:54.650 --> 05:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
person who was the clerk of the work so
 
05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with the terminology
 
05:11:58.610 --> 05:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
so Clark is the one is supposed to be
 
05:12:00.650 --> 05:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
there supporting the district
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we've seen some projects the
 
05:12:05.090 --> 05:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
clerk of the works been owned by the
 
05:12:08.090 --> 05:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
contractor or the subcontractors
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
and we've had a lot of change orders the
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
change orders of course change the value
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the cost of that building and then it
 
05:12:19.250 --> 05:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
results in somebody else having to Fork
 
05:12:22.970 --> 05:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
over this these additional costs and and
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
I I've been in a number of projects
 
05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
where I've seen change orders come up
 
05:12:30.170 --> 05:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
and the amount is extends well into the
 
05:12:32.330 --> 05:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars and we could avoided
 
05:12:33.948 --> 05:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
some of that if we had a positive Clerk
 
05:12:35.690 --> 05:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
of the works a person trained as an
 
05:12:38.208 --> 05:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
engineer overseeing this and it was also
 
05:12:40.850 --> 05:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
bonded so that they are this is their
 
05:12:42.770 --> 05:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
job you don't have somebody that's been
 
05:12:44.330 --> 05:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
on your staff that's the chief
 
05:12:46.490 --> 05:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
maintenance person come and say you're
 
05:12:47.570 --> 05:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
going to be in charge of this building
 
05:12:49.490 --> 05:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
project a lot of districts have done
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
that in the past and they've gotten in
 
05:12:53.270 --> 05:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
trouble like they did in the middle
 
05:12:56.448 --> 05:12:56.458 align:start position:0%
school I was in up in Haverhill where we
 
05:12:58.070 --> 05:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
had no Clerk of the works at the time
 
05:13:00.110 --> 05:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
and of course they've invented the art
 
05:13:02.570 --> 05:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
room out the lower level up and into the
 
05:13:04.610 --> 05:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
attic and we lost the roof not more than
 
05:13:07.850 --> 05:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
20 years 15 years later through rot
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
um that should have been changed and it
 
05:13:12.170 --> 05:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
noticed it wasn't
 
05:13:14.750 --> 05:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that walks us through what we're
 
05:13:17.330 --> 05:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
proposing here we're looking at a real
 
05:13:20.330 --> 05:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
overview and and a rewrite of the whole
 
05:13:24.070 --> 05:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
building School building uh aid program
 
05:13:29.208 --> 05:13:29.218 align:start position:0%
uh which it it drastically needs we we
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
have this thing we call the tail right
 
05:13:34.610 --> 05:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
now and the tail is absorbing half of
 
05:13:36.948 --> 05:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
what we have for school building a and
 
05:13:38.690 --> 05:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
when you look at the list which we just
 
05:13:41.448 --> 05:13:41.458 align:start position:0%
received the 17 projects on that list do
 
05:13:43.070 --> 05:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
look at the fourth one which is
 
05:13:45.590 --> 05:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
conquered and the state share would have
 
05:13:47.690 --> 05:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
been 70 million dollars that's more than
 
05:13:49.610 --> 05:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
we're allocating for the whole biennium
 
05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing buildings coming at us
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see how many
 
05:13:56.030 --> 05:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
buildings may be built in the period of
 
05:13:57.770 --> 05:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
two years it could be one
 
05:13:59.810 --> 05:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
depending upon you know the the building
 
05:14:01.970 --> 05:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
and the nature which it might be if it's
 
05:14:04.368 --> 05:14:04.378 align:start position:0%
a 30 percenter it's going to be a huge
 
05:14:06.530 --> 05:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars these new high schools
 
05:14:08.930 --> 05:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
are up close to what 100 million dollars
 
05:14:08.940 --> 05:14:10.190 align:start position:0%
are up close to what 100 million dollars
more

05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
uh much more and and so uh we've got to
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
look at this whole process and we have
 
05:14:17.930 --> 05:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we are really rank
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
ordering and recognizing those projects
 
05:14:22.970 --> 05:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
which really need to be there
 
05:14:24.890 --> 05:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more I believe we have to
 
05:14:26.690 --> 05:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
do this on terms of other types of
 
05:14:28.368 --> 05:14:28.378 align:start position:0%
facilities leasing buildings we need to
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
look at that the pot of money where
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
these pot do we break pots out for
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
renovation do we bake pots out for
 
05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
Capital new construction
 
05:14:38.448 --> 05:14:38.458 align:start position:0%
those are all questions
 
05:14:40.550 --> 05:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions and don't forget
 
05:14:42.410 --> 05:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
we got the technical people behind me
 
05:14:45.770 --> 05:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative miler
 
05:14:47.990 --> 05:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you've indicated
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh Rick in your testimony that we've got
 
05:14:56.330 --> 05:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
three grants that have been granted
 
05:15:00.050 --> 05:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
for 2023 correct that's correct and
 
05:15:02.448 --> 05:15:02.458 align:start position:0%
you've got well there they they're
 
05:15:04.490 --> 05:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
depending upon the money you're right
 
05:15:07.850 --> 05:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm gonna get to that uh this is a
 
05:15:09.770 --> 05:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
series of questions if you don't mind Mr
 
05:15:12.288 --> 05:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
chair uh and you'd indicated that there
 
05:15:16.970 --> 05:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
are were 17 requests for Grants correct
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's what I understand okay and how
 
05:15:21.650 --> 05:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
much money I mean we've been around this
 
05:15:23.270 --> 05:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
since you and I've been on this
 
05:15:26.150 --> 05:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
committee for 11 years has a major
 
05:15:29.208 --> 05:15:29.218 align:start position:0%
problem how much money do we have right
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
now that or as this is being proposed to
 
05:15:35.690 --> 05:15:35.700 align:start position:0%
be budgeted for these three Grant three
 
05:15:37.550 --> 05:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
grants that are going to be out there as
 
05:15:40.190 --> 05:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
well as the tail
 
05:15:42.288 --> 05:15:42.298 align:start position:0%
okay if you're if you're talking about
 
05:15:44.208 --> 05:15:44.218 align:start position:0%
the 10 I'll just use Brown figures here
 
05:15:46.250 --> 05:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
I don't have that the finance sheets in
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
front of me but the debt for each one of
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
those years if you total over to it for
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
the the two years of this biennium is 50
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars approximately and we're
 
05:15:58.550 --> 05:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to appropriate 50 million
 
05:16:01.788 --> 05:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
dollars each year of the biennium
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
so when you take half of that that's 100
 
05:16:06.530 --> 05:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the biennium but you
 
05:16:08.208 --> 05:16:08.218 align:start position:0%
know that half of that's already being
 
05:16:10.610 --> 05:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
used to pay debt off that leaves you
 
05:16:12.948 --> 05:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
just left the 50 million bucks
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
for new construction or renovation
 
05:16:17.390 --> 05:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
projects thank you very much for the
 
05:16:19.368 --> 05:16:19.378 align:start position:0%
questions representative Tanner
 
05:16:21.530 --> 05:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
do we ever get federal funds
 
05:16:23.448 --> 05:16:23.458 align:start position:0%
particularly with the new infrastructure
 
05:16:26.030 --> 05:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
Bill for school building Aid
 
05:16:29.208 --> 05:16:29.218 align:start position:0%
not for school but we have had monies
 
05:16:30.970 --> 05:16:30.980 align:start position:0%
that came down through these Federal
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
stabilization I like to call them
 
05:16:32.878 --> 05:16:34.010 align:start position:0%
stabilization I like to call them
dollars

05:16:34.010 --> 05:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:16:37.368 --> 05:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
um astronomies and all that you can use
 
05:16:40.250 --> 05:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
it for HVAC and we know that's occurred
 
05:16:42.530 --> 05:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
we know that's occurred for things maybe
 
05:16:45.770 --> 05:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
like Windows uh but it's not for the
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar
 
05:16:50.510 --> 05:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
um so that is the school constructions
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
basically and you you have to recall
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
that we've gone through a little it's
 
05:16:57.170 --> 05:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
about a 10 year more time it's a little
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
longer than that since the moratorium I
 
05:17:01.730 --> 05:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
I Amy maybe it's only about six projects
 
05:17:03.310 --> 05:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
which we have approved
 
05:17:06.770 --> 05:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
so during that time there was no
 
05:17:08.810 --> 05:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
construction going on other than what
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
the local school districts were doing on
 
05:17:14.330 --> 05:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
their own and we've had a number of
 
05:17:16.430 --> 05:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
bills that come to us where the those
 
05:17:18.770 --> 05:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
that did it during the moratorium are
 
05:17:20.628 --> 05:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
trying to get reimbursed what would be
 
05:17:25.128 --> 05:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
their estate share uh Unfortunately they
 
05:17:27.170 --> 05:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
did not you know they haven't complied
 
05:17:28.910 --> 05:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the timelines and the
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
conditions within the school building a
 
05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
program so at this point in time we just
 
05:17:34.750 --> 05:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
need to move forward
 
05:17:38.628 --> 05:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
and try to make the program work the
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
best way we can and hopefully we can
 
05:17:43.730 --> 05:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
make some changes here which are going
 
05:17:46.910 --> 05:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
to streamline it so that we can have
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
more time in which the the district
 
05:17:51.288 --> 05:17:51.298 align:start position:0%
itself has times to get things time
 
05:17:52.610 --> 05:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
enough to get it on a warrant article
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
find out if the talent's going to
 
05:17:56.570 --> 05:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
support that Grant we've unfortunately
 
05:17:59.448 --> 05:17:59.458 align:start position:0%
had some towns that on the Career Tech
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
side that have refused to take their
 
05:18:03.170 --> 05:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
money for the capital cost for the new
 
05:18:05.930 --> 05:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
CTE program and they've it went down the
 
05:18:10.430 --> 05:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
tube uh so uh there's much to this I
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
hope we can do something here
 
05:18:14.208 --> 05:18:14.218 align:start position:0%
um this is what I call the fourth leg of
 
05:18:16.850 --> 05:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
the stool School uh Construction and
 
05:18:18.530 --> 05:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
building is it does matches right up
 
05:18:20.090 --> 05:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
with correct curriculum instruction and
 
05:18:21.708 --> 05:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
labor costs we have to have the
 
05:18:24.770 --> 05:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
buildings yep
 
05:18:27.948 --> 05:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you thank
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
you Rick last year do I recall or in the
 
05:18:34.070 --> 05:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
last session that we did deal with the
 
05:18:35.810 --> 05:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
clerk of the clerk of the works bill
 
05:18:37.910 --> 05:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's almost like two years
 
05:18:40.550 --> 05:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
ago it was a while back was that and I'm
 
05:18:42.530 --> 05:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
looking at 34 specifically is that
 
05:18:44.750 --> 05:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
already in that's that's already in law
 
05:18:47.090 --> 05:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
and we're requiring that we have that
 
05:18:49.730 --> 05:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable person on board that's
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay so that's not a change no we're
 
05:18:56.270 --> 05:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:57.890 --> 05:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
um I had a question
 
05:18:57.900 --> 05:18:58.490 align:start position:0%
um I had a question
um

05:18:58.490 --> 05:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused between Roman 2A
 
05:19:07.628 --> 05:19:07.638 align:start position:0%
on page three and uh to be on page four
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
um 2A on lines 19 through 23
 
05:19:16.010 --> 05:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
approximately it talks about
 
05:19:18.288 --> 05:19:18.298 align:start position:0%
um uh the commissioner accepting the
 
05:19:20.810 --> 05:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
applications based on completeness and
 
05:19:23.650 --> 05:19:23.660 align:start position:0%
building a preliminary list
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
and then submitting the ranked list to
 
05:19:28.128 --> 05:19:28.138 align:start position:0%
the school building authority
 
05:19:32.628 --> 05:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
but then on B over on page four it talks
 
05:19:36.410 --> 05:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
about the commissioner accepting the
 
05:19:40.430 --> 05:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
proposals based on completeness okay Amy
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
yeah so I don't go around the bar the
 
05:19:44.090 --> 05:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
the school building authority has to
 
05:19:46.010 --> 05:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
have that out earlier now in this one
 
05:19:49.430 --> 05:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
you can see the date is October 15th
 
05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
before it was the end of this or in
 
05:19:57.230 --> 05:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
December and so we're trying to backing
 
05:19:58.850 --> 05:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
everything out so far you're looking at
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
the those some of those criteria for
 
05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
ranking first the the areas which were
 
05:20:07.128 --> 05:20:07.138 align:start position:0%
you know doing on on the next page on
 
05:20:10.070 --> 05:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
page four which we use a lot of that
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
information for that signing the numbers
 
05:20:16.010 --> 05:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
like that it used to be 275 points I
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it's the same Amy now
 
05:20:18.830 --> 05:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:20:21.590 --> 05:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and each one's had different amount
 
05:20:24.530 --> 05:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
of points okay to rank order based on
 
05:20:26.628 --> 05:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
that criteria one through nine okay
 
05:20:28.368 --> 05:20:28.378 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll follow up with Miss Clark
 
05:20:31.368 --> 05:20:31.378 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah any further questions thank
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:38.208 --> 05:20:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:41.330 --> 05:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
I don't see him
 
05:21:02.890 --> 05:21:02.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:04.990 --> 05:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Amy Clark and
 
05:21:09.650 --> 05:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
I'm at the Department of Education I
 
05:21:11.930 --> 05:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
work for the school facilities Bureau
 
05:21:13.250 --> 05:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator for the school
 
05:21:14.990 --> 05:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
facilities Bureau and the school
 
05:21:16.970 --> 05:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
building aid program falls under my
 
05:21:20.810 --> 05:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
Bureau so mostly I'm here for technical
 
05:21:23.090 --> 05:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
assistance but I did want to walk you
 
05:21:25.250 --> 05:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
through I do have a handout that walks
 
05:21:26.650 --> 05:21:26.660 align:start position:0%
through the timeline
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
and just I want to point out some
 
05:21:32.930 --> 05:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
important pieces to this language that I
 
05:21:36.050 --> 05:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure is clear
 
05:21:36.060 --> 05:21:37.730 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure is clear
okay

05:21:37.730 --> 05:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:21:40.670 --> 05:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
and so if I think you all probably have
 
05:21:40.680 --> 05:21:41.628 align:start position:0%
and so if I think you all probably have
it

05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:21:45.230 --> 05:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
um on the first page is I tried to mimic
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
what the current law currently does for
 
05:21:50.330 --> 05:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
a timeline and the second page is what
 
05:21:55.550 --> 05:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
house bill uh 452 does to that timeline
 
05:21:58.610 --> 05:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
for the most part to me anyway for the
 
05:22:00.410 --> 05:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
most part this bill is about the
 
05:22:02.810 --> 05:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
timeline I think representative Ladd did
 
05:22:04.868 --> 05:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
a good job of walking through the bill
 
05:22:07.610 --> 05:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
but for the most part A lot of those
 
05:22:09.650 --> 05:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
pieces as representative Woodcock
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out a lot of those pieces are
 
05:22:13.610 --> 05:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
there they're just kind of reorganized
 
05:22:18.050 --> 05:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh in a uh easier fashion to process but
 
05:22:20.208 --> 05:22:20.218 align:start position:0%
the real meat of this bill the big
 
05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
changes in this bill is really the
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
timeline in which schools apply for
 
05:22:25.610 --> 05:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
building Aid
 
05:22:27.890 --> 05:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
well I think it's probably best
 
05:22:29.868 --> 05:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
um if you'll allow for me just to go
 
05:22:31.490 --> 05:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
through that timeline the existing
 
05:22:31.500 --> 05:22:33.170 align:start position:0%
through that timeline the existing
timeline

05:22:33.170 --> 05:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
05:22:36.230 --> 05:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
so I'll do that so on the current law so
 
05:22:38.270 --> 05:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
this is currently how a building aid
 
05:22:40.550 --> 05:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
application is processed and again just
 
05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
for reminders building Aid is just a
 
05:22:45.470 --> 05:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
state aid for the construction of large
 
05:22:46.970 --> 05:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
construction projects we're not talking
 
05:22:49.310 --> 05:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
about a room renovation and new
 
05:22:51.708 --> 05:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
carpeting and a new roof uh and changing
 
05:22:53.448 --> 05:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
out windows we're talking about a
 
05:22:56.810 --> 05:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
rebuild of a new school maybe you're
 
05:22:58.730 --> 05:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
consolidating to schools and building a
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
new school perhaps you're putting on an
 
05:23:02.690 --> 05:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
addition or perhaps you're gutting the
 
05:23:04.430 --> 05:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
building and bringing it back up to new
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
condition and that's what we call a
 
05:23:08.690 --> 05:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
substantial renovation project
 
05:23:10.730 --> 05:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
so what happens
 
05:23:10.740 --> 05:23:11.628 align:start position:0%
so what happens
um

05:23:11.628 --> 05:23:11.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:14.330 --> 05:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that this is all before the
 
05:23:16.850 --> 05:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
state budget is approved so the dollar
 
05:23:20.270 --> 05:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
amount is unknown to school districts
 
05:23:22.850 --> 05:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
first they spend a couple years figuring
 
05:23:24.050 --> 05:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
out whether a school construction
 
05:23:25.850 --> 05:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
project is something that they want to
 
05:23:27.708 --> 05:23:27.718 align:start position:0%
do I think that's really important to
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
understand that people school districts
 
05:23:31.970 --> 05:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
are not talking about this over lunch
 
05:23:34.190 --> 05:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
one day and just decided that they're
 
05:23:36.110 --> 05:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
going to build a new school these are
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
many years of planning before they even
 
05:23:39.910 --> 05:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
come to my office
 
05:23:43.070 --> 05:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
so when they're ready they apply for
 
05:23:46.190 --> 05:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
billing Aid by January 1st every two
 
05:23:48.830 --> 05:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
years the state has a biennium budget so
 
05:23:52.010 --> 05:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
they come in January 1st they submit a
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
letter that they intend on applying and
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
that comes in 18 months prior to the
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
state budget being approved
 
05:24:01.320 --> 05:24:02.448 align:start position:0%
state budget being approved
um

05:24:02.448 --> 05:24:02.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:05.330 --> 05:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
from there they then actually fill out
 
05:24:07.250 --> 05:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
their full application
 
05:24:09.890 --> 05:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
um by July 1st which is 12 months before
 
05:24:12.890 --> 05:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
the state budget is approved
 
05:24:14.750 --> 05:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
so in this particular case if you think
 
05:24:17.090 --> 05:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
of the state budget hopefully being
 
05:24:19.730 --> 05:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
approved July 1st of this year the
 
05:24:21.770 --> 05:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
application applicants that you may have
 
05:24:24.170 --> 05:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
seen on that application that list of 17
 
05:24:26.990 --> 05:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
they actually applied last summer in
 
05:24:28.670 --> 05:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
July so that's how that timeline worked
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
out for them
 
05:24:31.910 --> 05:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
so July 1st we get a bunch of
 
05:24:33.770 --> 05:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
applications on our desk we review them
 
05:24:35.810 --> 05:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
as the Department of Education we spend
 
05:24:37.850 --> 05:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
about four months July to October
 
05:24:40.368 --> 05:24:40.378 align:start position:0%
reviewing those applications we do site
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
visits it's a it's a very thorough
 
05:24:44.690 --> 05:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
review the applications are hundreds of
 
05:24:47.150 --> 05:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
pages they include lots of documentation
 
05:24:49.550 --> 05:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
important documentation engineering
 
05:24:51.948 --> 05:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
reports Mechanical plumbing structural
 
05:24:54.590 --> 05:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
reports things like that
 
05:24:57.890 --> 05:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
um by December 1st the law requires that
 
05:25:00.470 --> 05:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
the school building authority
 
05:25:01.788 --> 05:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
um well the department of education
 
05:25:04.070 --> 05:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
education then ranks those projects
 
05:25:05.930 --> 05:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
based on the criteria that are really
 
05:25:08.448 --> 05:25:08.458 align:start position:0%
that are in the law right now and the
 
05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
proposed bill for the most part fairly
 
05:25:14.270 --> 05:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
the same uh and then by December 1st the
 
05:25:16.010 --> 05:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
school building authority reviews the
 
05:25:17.448 --> 05:25:17.458 align:start position:0%
department of education's ranking
 
05:25:19.490 --> 05:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
verifies it and submits it to the State
 
05:25:21.830 --> 05:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
Board of Education for approval and
 
05:25:24.350 --> 05:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education by law is
 
05:25:26.510 --> 05:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
required to review and approve that
 
05:25:29.930 --> 05:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
ranked list by January 15th January 15th
 
05:25:33.410 --> 05:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
is now about six months before the state
 
05:25:35.570 --> 05:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
budget is approved
 
05:25:37.670 --> 05:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
by March
 
05:25:39.350 --> 05:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
um schools still don't know whether the
 
05:25:41.270 --> 05:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
state budget is approved but then if
 
05:25:43.310 --> 05:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
they want to construct they have to then
 
05:25:45.410 --> 05:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
go to their Town voters without knowing
 
05:25:47.090 --> 05:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
if the state has any money for school
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
construction so then they get a warrant
 
05:25:51.890 --> 05:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
article ready and they don't really know
 
05:25:53.208 --> 05:25:53.218 align:start position:0%
whether State funds are going to be
 
05:25:55.250 --> 05:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
there but they put a warrant article
 
05:25:57.530 --> 05:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
together for March which is about four
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
months prior to the state budget being
 
05:26:00.718 --> 05:26:01.788 align:start position:0%
months prior to the state budget being
approved

05:26:01.788 --> 05:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
approved
 
05:26:04.490 --> 05:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
okay now of course you have February
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
Town meetings April summer cities and
 
05:26:08.570 --> 05:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
some operate differently but for the
 
05:26:10.430 --> 05:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
most part that's what a lot of
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
communities are doing
 
05:26:15.410 --> 05:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
by July 1st we have a state budget that
 
05:26:17.690 --> 05:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
could be currently there's not a minimum
 
05:26:19.250 --> 05:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
amount of building Aid so that could be
 
05:26:21.170 --> 05:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
no money or that could be 50 million
 
05:26:24.230 --> 05:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
dollars somewhere in between
 
05:26:24.240 --> 05:26:26.090 align:start position:0%
dollars somewhere in between
um

05:26:26.090 --> 05:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:29.570 --> 05:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
now interestingly construction projects
 
05:26:33.590 --> 05:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't work on fiscal years so by July
 
05:26:36.110 --> 05:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
1st a school district has found out that
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to get building Aid
 
05:26:40.850 --> 05:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
they don't have a contractor sitting
 
05:26:42.350 --> 05:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
there waiting for the governor to sign
 
05:26:44.208 --> 05:26:44.218 align:start position:0%
the budget on site and it's and they're
 
05:26:45.708 --> 05:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
going to be able to put a shovel in the
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
ground in July so they really lose that
 
05:26:51.410 --> 05:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
whole summer and most of the projects
 
05:26:53.448 --> 05:26:53.458 align:start position:0%
that unless they're building on a brand
 
05:26:55.490 --> 05:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
new site it might be easier for them but
 
05:26:58.128 --> 05:26:58.138 align:start position:0%
keep in mind most of these projects will
 
05:27:01.330 --> 05:27:01.340 align:start position:0%
be substantial Renovations or additions
 
05:27:03.708 --> 05:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
and they have to move kids around so
 
05:27:05.448 --> 05:27:05.458 align:start position:0%
summer is a really important time for
 
05:27:07.550 --> 05:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
schools to be in construction so they
 
05:27:09.470 --> 05:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
for the most part have lost that whole
 
05:27:12.410 --> 05:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
summer and will probably start that
 
05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and sometime maybe March
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
April May I'm starting to do some
 
05:27:18.770 --> 05:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
preliminary work
 
05:27:21.530 --> 05:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
so that is the current process and it is
 
05:27:23.570 --> 05:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
repeated every two years
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
so what house bill
 
05:27:30.170 --> 05:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
um 542 does
 
05:27:32.030 --> 05:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
um is this is the different this is the
 
05:27:35.030 --> 05:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
new timeline same planning goes on
 
05:27:37.490 --> 05:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
but instead
 
05:27:40.250 --> 05:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
um the the bill requires that schools
 
05:27:43.010 --> 05:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
apply by April 1st
 
05:27:46.010 --> 05:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
three months prior to the state budget
 
05:27:48.770 --> 05:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
being approved so this is jumping way
 
05:27:51.948 --> 05:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
ahead of the existing timeline then the
 
05:27:54.890 --> 05:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Education reviews uh those
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
applications just like normal all of the
 
05:27:58.610 --> 05:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
stuff is the same process
 
05:28:01.310 --> 05:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh by July 1st then the budget is
 
05:28:01.320 --> 05:28:02.390 align:start position:0%
uh by July 1st then the budget is
approved

05:28:02.390 --> 05:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
approved
 
05:28:04.850 --> 05:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
by August 1st so we're not giving out
 
05:28:06.230 --> 05:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
that money right away we're kind of
 
05:28:08.090 --> 05:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
holding it we're holding it waiting for
 
05:28:09.770 --> 05:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
those projects to be finished ranked
 
05:28:12.050 --> 05:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
they then go to the school building
 
05:28:14.810 --> 05:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
authority by August 1st then they go to
 
05:28:17.090 --> 05:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education by November
 
05:28:21.288 --> 05:28:21.298 align:start position:0%
15th then towns go to uh vote in March
 
05:28:23.410 --> 05:28:23.420 align:start position:0%
and then they can begin construction
 
05:28:26.090 --> 05:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
that spring summer whenever they are
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
ready so the big and the other big
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
difference is then we repeat this every
 
05:28:33.230 --> 05:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
year so that schools aren't having to
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
wait every two years
 
05:28:39.708 --> 05:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
so the key differences if you're going
 
05:28:42.110 --> 05:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
to sum all of that up the key difference
 
05:28:44.030 --> 05:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
is this house bill does
 
05:28:46.368 --> 05:28:46.378 align:start position:0%
is it first it creates an annual
 
05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
application process instead of every two
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
years now it's every year
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
um which interestingly
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
means a lot to school districts if you
 
05:28:57.530 --> 05:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
tell them they have to wait two years
 
05:29:00.288 --> 05:29:00.298 align:start position:0%
it's like forever but they can
 
05:29:02.690 --> 05:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
understand next year that's okay just
 
05:29:04.970 --> 05:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
seems I'm that way too one more year
 
05:29:06.770 --> 05:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
comes and goes but two years is a long
 
05:29:08.090 --> 05:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
time to wait
 
05:29:12.288 --> 05:29:12.298 align:start position:0%
um then um House Bill 5502 also ranks
 
05:29:15.650 --> 05:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
those projects after the appropriation
 
05:29:19.090 --> 05:29:19.100 align:start position:0%
is known and the current building Aid
 
05:29:22.190 --> 05:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
ranks the projects in schools are
 
05:29:24.170 --> 05:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
essentially waiting their Community is
 
05:29:25.670 --> 05:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
waiting to figure out what they're going
 
05:29:26.810 --> 05:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:29:30.650 --> 05:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill uh 542 also publishes the
 
05:29:32.570 --> 05:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
list the school the State Board of
 
05:29:34.788 --> 05:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
Education publishes the list in November
 
05:29:38.150 --> 05:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
instead of January and anybody writing a
 
05:29:39.650 --> 05:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
warrant article for a school district
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
knows that having an understanding of
 
05:29:44.208 --> 05:29:44.218 align:start position:0%
what funds are going to potentially be
 
05:29:46.670 --> 05:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
available by November versus January
 
05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
15th is a lot more difficult
 
05:29:53.330 --> 05:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
and then lastly I just want to point out
 
05:29:55.490 --> 05:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
that I already kind of mentioned it but
 
05:29:58.368 --> 05:29:58.378 align:start position:0%
houseboat 552 also allows for a more
 
05:30:00.410 --> 05:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
efficient construction schedule again
 
05:30:02.270 --> 05:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
you're not losing that whole summer
 
05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
which costs increase a lot of um that's
 
05:30:08.150 --> 05:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of frustration too because the
 
05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
town voted on it yet you're not even
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
able to put a shovel in the ground until
 
05:30:13.910 --> 05:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
much later waiting to see if the state
 
05:30:19.070 --> 05:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
can award any funds so with that I guess
 
05:30:21.590 --> 05:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
I only I the only other thing I'm hoping
 
05:30:24.170 --> 05:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
I can spare your time on is just
 
05:30:25.730 --> 05:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
pointing out a couple of the things that
 
05:30:30.350 --> 05:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
um I think may need some attention
 
05:30:35.330 --> 05:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
and and it's probably my fault but I'm
 
05:30:37.730 --> 05:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
gonna say for something for you to
 
05:30:40.490 --> 05:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
consider uh would be for process wise
 
05:30:42.948 --> 05:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
looking through the bill
 
05:30:46.250 --> 05:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
um would be that you may want to define
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
a school district if you look on page
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll pass these comments along too
 
05:30:55.610 --> 05:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
but um on page two uh school district is
 
05:30:57.890 --> 05:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
defined in the current law and there's
 
05:31:00.470 --> 05:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
existing language and it hasn't carried
 
05:31:02.330 --> 05:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
over into this bill and again I know
 
05:31:03.470 --> 05:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
that I've reviewed this bill and that's
 
05:31:05.390 --> 05:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
probably my fault for not catching that
 
05:31:07.310 --> 05:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
earlier but number one you may want to
 
05:31:09.070 --> 05:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
Define school district
 
05:31:13.910 --> 05:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
and number two on the top of Page Three
 
05:31:13.920 --> 05:31:14.990 align:start position:0%
and number two on the top of Page Three
foreign

05:31:14.990 --> 05:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:31:18.288 --> 05:31:18.298 align:start position:0%
S one and two it talks about projects
 
05:31:20.390 --> 05:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
with approval from the local school
 
05:31:22.368 --> 05:31:22.378 align:start position:0%
district's legislative body to construct
 
05:31:24.288 --> 05:31:24.298 align:start position:0%
not subject to receiving building Aid
 
05:31:26.150 --> 05:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
this is essentially telling people who
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
can apply and I don't think that's the
 
05:31:32.208 --> 05:31:32.218 align:start position:0%
intent there so again it says
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
um that essentially a school can apply
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
for school building Aid I don't think
 
05:31:40.128 --> 05:31:40.138 align:start position:0%
that the intent is for schools to see
 
05:31:42.410 --> 05:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
receive legislative approval prior to
 
05:31:42.420 --> 05:31:43.670 align:start position:0%
receive legislative approval prior to
applying

05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
applying
 
05:31:45.470 --> 05:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
um but I may be wrong
 
05:31:49.070 --> 05:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh and then lastly that same comment
 
05:31:50.750 --> 05:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
something you may want to consider is on
 
05:31:52.250 --> 05:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
page four
 
05:31:53.930 --> 05:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
um it talks about
 
05:31:57.470 --> 05:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
um when you stay on the list and line
 
05:32:01.128 --> 05:32:01.138 align:start position:0%
line 27 and 28 on page four talks about
 
05:32:03.050 --> 05:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
also schools would get bumped off that
 
05:32:05.330 --> 05:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
list if they didn't receive District's
 
05:32:07.490 --> 05:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
legislative body approval so essentially
 
05:32:10.128 --> 05:32:10.138 align:start position:0%
if the town says no you get booted off
 
05:32:13.310 --> 05:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
the list I would I would say on my end
 
05:32:15.590 --> 05:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
process wise they're just going to apply
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
the next year and we're just gonna have
 
05:32:19.970 --> 05:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
to redo their application so I would
 
05:32:21.590 --> 05:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
probably prefer that they stay on that
 
05:32:23.448 --> 05:32:23.458 align:start position:0%
list if you wanted them to only stand
 
05:32:25.550 --> 05:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
that list so many years that might make
 
05:32:27.170 --> 05:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
sense although the Department of
 
05:32:28.788 --> 05:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
Education has the authority to make
 
05:32:30.890 --> 05:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
those rules um and we could
 
05:32:32.330 --> 05:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
um we'll be doing rule making if this
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
passes anyway to meet all these
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
timelines and we would include it in
 
05:32:38.930 --> 05:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
that area so that'd be another thing to
 
05:32:38.940 --> 05:32:39.948 align:start position:0%
that area so that'd be another thing to
consider

05:32:39.948 --> 05:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:32:43.850 --> 05:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
and then I think that's it unless you
 
05:32:46.850 --> 05:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:49.670 --> 05:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes reps
 
05:32:51.650 --> 05:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:32:54.170 --> 05:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you for answering my question
 
05:32:56.750 --> 05:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand the whole
 
05:32:56.760 --> 05:32:58.250 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand the whole
process

05:32:58.250 --> 05:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:32:58.260 --> 05:33:01.128 align:start position:0%
process
so

05:33:01.128 --> 05:33:01.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:01.138 --> 05:33:03.890 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:33:03.890 --> 05:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:06.288 --> 05:33:06.298 align:start position:0%
the town knows whether or not they're on
 
05:33:07.610 --> 05:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
the list
 
05:33:10.368 --> 05:33:10.378 align:start position:0%
before they go
 
05:33:10.378 --> 05:33:12.350 align:start position:0%
before they go
to vote

05:33:12.350 --> 05:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
05:33:15.530 --> 05:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
but if they vote down and the next
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
number two on the list votes down and
 
05:33:19.368 --> 05:33:19.378 align:start position:0%
number three
 
05:33:23.090 --> 05:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
so you keep being bummed up so do you
 
05:33:26.208 --> 05:33:26.218 align:start position:0%
put then to make sure that you're let's
 
05:33:28.128 --> 05:33:28.138 align:start position:0%
say You're Number Four
 
05:33:29.930 --> 05:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
and you figure we haven't got a chance
 
05:33:32.090 --> 05:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
because we're number four but the top
 
05:33:35.330 --> 05:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
three don't go now you're on so are you
 
05:33:39.948 --> 05:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
putting on your ballot the question just
 
05:33:43.730 --> 05:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
in case you get it and can you write in
 
05:33:47.470 --> 05:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
on your ballot on your warrant
 
05:33:50.150 --> 05:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
provided the town the provided the state
 
05:33:53.150 --> 05:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
gives this money we approve this that's
 
05:33:55.190 --> 05:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
very good question so under the current
 
05:33:57.288 --> 05:33:57.298 align:start position:0%
process that's one of the complications
 
05:33:59.628 --> 05:33:59.638 align:start position:0%
that school districts have to face is
 
05:34:02.150 --> 05:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
they don't know whether other schools
 
05:34:04.250 --> 05:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
have passed or not because that's not
 
05:34:06.890 --> 05:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
done until after the budget has been uh
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
approved uh and they don't know what
 
05:34:10.850 --> 05:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
other towns have done so
 
05:34:13.010 --> 05:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
um there are towns that are further down
 
05:34:15.410 --> 05:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
on the list that don't know how much
 
05:34:17.570 --> 05:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
money is going to be available uh and
 
05:34:20.030 --> 05:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
don't know the the fate of the other
 
05:34:22.128 --> 05:34:22.138 align:start position:0%
Town votes so they are putting they are
 
05:34:24.590 --> 05:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
at least considering putting on two
 
05:34:27.708 --> 05:34:27.718 align:start position:0%
Warren articles and that also presents
 
05:34:29.330 --> 05:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
challenges but just like you said they
 
05:34:31.730 --> 05:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
some schools are looking to go with
 
05:34:33.530 --> 05:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
contingent warrant articles and other
 
05:34:35.690 --> 05:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
schools are just going to hold off and
 
05:34:38.030 --> 05:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
wait to see what happens that's legal
 
05:34:40.250 --> 05:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
for them to do that I believe so only
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
because that seems to be what some
 
05:34:43.670 --> 05:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
school districts are doing thank you
 
05:34:45.530 --> 05:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:34:45.540 --> 05:34:49.270 align:start position:0%
very much
foreign

05:34:49.270 --> 05:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:52.490 --> 05:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I will
 
05:34:54.350 --> 05:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
represent Miley
 
05:34:56.390 --> 05:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank Amy for
 
05:34:58.850 --> 05:34:58.860 align:start position:0%
being here sure uh so if I have this
 
05:34:58.860 --> 05:34:59.930 align:start position:0%
being here sure uh so if I have this
right

05:34:59.930 --> 05:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
we've had 17 projects that were
 
05:35:02.520 --> 05:35:03.948 align:start position:0%
we've had 17 projects that were
requested

05:35:03.948 --> 05:35:03.958 align:start position:0%
requested
 
05:35:05.930 --> 05:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
three were funded
 
05:35:08.570 --> 05:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
and that basically took up the 15
 
05:35:10.690 --> 05:35:10.700 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was available
 
05:35:14.030 --> 05:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh not including the tail expense that's
 
05:35:15.650 --> 05:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
there is that correct
 
05:35:17.628 --> 05:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
um not not technically
 
05:35:20.868 --> 05:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
um so the ranked list is a ranked list
 
05:35:22.850 --> 05:35:22.860 align:start position:0%
and it sits there ranked one two and
 
05:35:25.368 --> 05:35:25.378 align:start position:0%
three right but what we don't know we
 
05:35:27.230 --> 05:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
don't know how much money is going to be
 
05:35:29.810 --> 05:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate for building Aid so assuming
 
05:35:33.650 --> 05:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
you're right in the assumption that the
 
05:35:36.470 --> 05:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
um that building is fully funded which
 
05:35:38.270 --> 05:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
means a maximum of 50 million dollars in
 
05:35:40.490 --> 05:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
Aid is given each year there would be
 
05:35:42.890 --> 05:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
enough money to fund those top three
 
05:35:45.470 --> 05:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
projects however those top three
 
05:35:48.410 --> 05:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
projects have not voted yet so we're
 
05:35:50.330 --> 05:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
waiting to see so to say that they've
 
05:35:53.448 --> 05:35:53.458 align:start position:0%
been awarded money is definitely not we
 
05:35:55.010 --> 05:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would never say
 
05:35:57.288 --> 05:35:57.298 align:start position:0%
that because one no money has been
 
05:35:59.930 --> 05:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
appropriated for new projects uh a
 
05:36:02.990 --> 05:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
budget is in not been signed and then
 
05:36:05.868 --> 05:36:05.878 align:start position:0%
also the towns have not had their votes
 
05:36:08.570 --> 05:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
at so all three could fail and it would
 
05:36:10.128 --> 05:36:10.138 align:start position:0%
go down to others kind of similar
 
05:36:11.868 --> 05:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
presenting some other problems not
 
05:36:14.510 --> 05:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
problem good problems but some surprises
 
05:36:17.868 --> 05:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
so if if one of the three they don't
 
05:36:19.788 --> 05:36:19.798 align:start position:0%
pass in their town meeting or whatever
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
then it does then go down to the fourth
 
05:36:23.810 --> 05:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
one that's on the list correct correct
 
05:36:26.330 --> 05:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
that money is appropriated the way I
 
05:36:28.070 --> 05:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
would look at it is it just happens to
 
05:36:31.010 --> 05:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
be 50 million uh minus the tail gives
 
05:36:32.628 --> 05:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
enough for the for the top three
 
05:36:34.730 --> 05:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
projects but really money is offered to
 
05:36:37.250 --> 05:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
that first ranked project if they pass
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
their local funding piece and if they
 
05:36:43.250 --> 05:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
can they take whatever award their their
 
05:36:45.470 --> 05:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
application is for and then it keeps
 
05:36:47.448 --> 05:36:47.458 align:start position:0%
moving down until we run out of money do
 
05:36:49.970 --> 05:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
we know what the as you monitor this do
 
05:36:52.730 --> 05:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
we know what the budget proposal is for
 
05:36:55.430 --> 05:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
building Aid and the pending budget
 
05:36:56.810 --> 05:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
um well not for the pending budget
 
05:36:58.610 --> 05:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
because I've not seen it yet but what I
 
05:37:02.448 --> 05:37:02.458 align:start position:0%
can say is if building Aid were fully
 
05:37:04.850 --> 05:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
funded which when we use that term we
 
05:37:07.368 --> 05:37:07.378 align:start position:0%
mean the law allows a maximum of 50
 
05:37:09.590 --> 05:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
million in Aid so 50 million was
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
appropriated in year one of the budget
 
05:37:13.788 --> 05:37:13.798 align:start position:0%
in year two of the budget and that
 
05:37:16.128 --> 05:37:16.138 align:start position:0%
passes and signing a law on July 1st
 
05:37:19.070 --> 05:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
then after we pay all our debt for old
 
05:37:21.230 --> 05:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
projects and then our state Bond debt we
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
would have 49 million dollars left for
 
05:37:26.690 --> 05:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
the biennium for new projects and that
 
05:37:28.430 --> 05:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
would allow us to offer the first ranked
 
05:37:30.470 --> 05:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
project money and if they accept would
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
be enough we'd have left over to offer
 
05:37:34.368 --> 05:37:34.378 align:start position:0%
number two if they were able to accept
 
05:37:36.350 --> 05:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
we'd have enough to offer number three
 
05:37:38.510 --> 05:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
and we would then run out of money and
 
05:37:41.390 --> 05:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
finally if I heard you correctly
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is an annual request so in other
 
05:37:48.890 --> 05:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
words those 17 we don't fund all of them
 
05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
obviously do they then if they are still
 
05:37:54.730 --> 05:37:54.740 align:start position:0%
in the queue for
 
05:37:57.350 --> 05:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
requesting again they have to do that on
 
05:37:59.448 --> 05:37:59.458 align:start position:0%
an annual basis that doesn't hold over
 
05:38:01.070 --> 05:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
for the biennium
 
05:38:03.410 --> 05:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
um they have to do it in a our list is
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the biennium and the current law
 
05:38:08.690 --> 05:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
would require that they apply again in
 
05:38:12.110 --> 05:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
the next biennium unless they have their
 
05:38:14.270 --> 05:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
District's legislative body approval and
 
05:38:16.368 --> 05:38:16.378 align:start position:0%
they did not construct okay so so it's
 
05:38:18.230 --> 05:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
for the biennium that the that the
 
05:38:19.910 --> 05:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
grants go through there correct the
 
05:38:21.708 --> 05:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
request correct thank you very much yeah
 
05:38:24.830 --> 05:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
you're welcome Carson represent cordelli
 
05:38:25.970 --> 05:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:38:27.830 --> 05:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
um could you speak to the letter of
 
05:38:30.650 --> 05:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
intent and where that fits into the
 
05:38:30.660 --> 05:38:31.788 align:start position:0%
intent and where that fits into the
process

05:38:31.788 --> 05:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:38:33.350 --> 05:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
um with the proposal
 
05:38:36.350 --> 05:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
um correct it's missing um on purpose I
 
05:38:38.628 --> 05:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
mean you you could so what the letter of
 
05:38:41.150 --> 05:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
intent the current letter of intent is
 
05:38:43.550 --> 05:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
one sheet of paper that school districts
 
05:38:45.410 --> 05:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
fill out the superintendent signs it it
 
05:38:47.208 --> 05:38:47.218 align:start position:0%
says we intend on applying for building
 
05:38:50.628 --> 05:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
Aid and what we have done is we've
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
um used we my office of one has use that
 
05:38:59.208 --> 05:38:59.218 align:start position:0%
to plan for what's going to happen in
 
05:39:01.850 --> 05:39:01.860 align:start position:0%
July and it kind of like oh how many
 
05:39:04.128 --> 05:39:04.138 align:start position:0%
applications am I going to get we were
 
05:39:06.770 --> 05:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
coming into this as a fairly new process
 
05:39:08.930 --> 05:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
this is the third time we've ranked
 
05:39:11.448 --> 05:39:11.458 align:start position:0%
projects the first time you have to
 
05:39:14.270 --> 05:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
apply 18 months ahead of time so those
 
05:39:16.910 --> 05:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
first round were applying during the
 
05:39:19.970 --> 05:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
moratorium which you know they were
 
05:39:21.650 --> 05:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
crossing their fingers really tight and
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
they got really lucky but most schools
 
05:39:25.788 --> 05:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
didn't put resources into applying the
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
second biennium that they were to apply
 
05:39:30.350 --> 05:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
their deadline for application was July
 
05:39:35.230 --> 05:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
of 2020. so obviously pandemic brand new
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that list might have been a little
 
05:39:39.650 --> 05:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
short too and then this last time is
 
05:39:41.208 --> 05:39:41.218 align:start position:0%
really probably when we got the first
 
05:39:43.430 --> 05:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
round of applications I guess the reason
 
05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
saying that is the letter of intent
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
really helps me planning it really I
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
think I spent more time talking to
 
05:39:52.610 --> 05:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
schools about all they needed to do it
 
05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
for me it's just not worth it to have
 
05:39:56.690 --> 05:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
the letter of intent but if it was added
 
05:39:58.490 --> 05:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
in there schools could certainly give me
 
05:40:00.110 --> 05:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
a heads up that they're intending on
 
05:40:01.310 --> 05:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
applying I just don't know if it would
 
05:40:03.890 --> 05:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
do anything it didn't add value
 
05:40:06.708 --> 05:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
further further questions you have a
 
05:40:08.690 --> 05:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes please
 
05:40:11.690 --> 05:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
um uh if you have
 
05:40:14.990 --> 05:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
um let's say four or five projects and
 
05:40:18.530 --> 05:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
the available money is used up
 
05:40:20.510 --> 05:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
um for the most part by the top three
 
05:40:24.170 --> 05:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
but then there is some money left over
 
05:40:28.670 --> 05:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
for uh project number four but not what
 
05:40:31.788 --> 05:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
they need really are they better off
 
05:40:34.910 --> 05:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
taking what's available then or are now
 
05:40:37.610 --> 05:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
waiting until the next year to resubmit
 
05:40:40.030 --> 05:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
maybe being high on higher on the list
 
05:40:43.670 --> 05:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
so currently the process is we obviously
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
we can't promise money we don't have so
 
05:40:47.570 --> 05:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
when we run out of money let's say we
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
had a million dollars left and we can
 
05:40:51.230 --> 05:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
offer it to that school and they can
 
05:40:52.970 --> 05:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
take it and run and that's all they're
 
05:40:54.410 --> 05:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
ever going to get is that million
 
05:40:58.250 --> 05:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
dollars or they can apply the following
 
05:40:58.260 --> 05:40:59.570 align:start position:0%
dollars or they can apply the following
biennium

05:40:59.570 --> 05:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
05:41:02.990 --> 05:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
um that's if depending you know that's a
 
05:41:05.208 --> 05:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
it's an individual little decision I can
 
05:41:06.770 --> 05:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
see why schools would say yes and no
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
depends on how much money it is
 
05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
construction costs Rising every year and
 
05:41:13.030 --> 05:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
whether building Aid would be funded
 
05:41:15.470 --> 05:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
it's quite a gamble to pass up on a
 
05:41:17.570 --> 05:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
million bucks I imagine but then again
 
05:41:18.650 --> 05:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
some schools wouldn't be able to
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
construct with a million dollar Grant
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
when they're seeking a 30 million dollar
 
05:41:21.600 --> 05:41:22.610 align:start position:0%
when they're seeking a 30 million dollar
Grant

05:41:22.610 --> 05:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
05:41:24.650 --> 05:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions represent
 
05:41:27.410 --> 05:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
Myler do you have your no no okay you
 
05:41:29.650 --> 05:41:29.660 align:start position:0%
got your mic
 
05:41:33.288 --> 05:41:33.298 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair and I'm not sure
 
05:41:36.530 --> 05:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
if if um if if the question's really
 
05:41:39.288 --> 05:41:39.298 align:start position:0%
directed to 452 or maybe the next bill
 
05:41:41.868 --> 05:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
which I think uses
 
05:41:44.150 --> 05:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
um the exist is based on top of the
 
05:41:45.890 --> 05:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
existing language as opposed to the
 
05:41:48.410 --> 05:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
language that could be amended by 452.
 
05:41:48.420 --> 05:41:49.550 align:start position:0%
language that could be amended by 452.
but

05:41:49.550 --> 05:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:41:52.550 --> 05:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
um but 452 does
 
05:41:52.560 --> 05:41:53.930 align:start position:0%
um but 452 does
um

05:41:53.930 --> 05:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:57.230 --> 05:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
does contain uh language on page one
 
05:41:59.810 --> 05:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
lines 14 15 which which are from current
 
05:42:03.410 --> 05:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
law with respect to uh building aid for
 
05:42:07.490 --> 05:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
um uh for a chartered public school and
 
05:42:07.500 --> 05:42:08.030 align:start position:0%
um uh for a chartered public school and
um

05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:11.150 --> 05:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
and I guess the way the way 452 is
 
05:42:13.910 --> 05:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
drafted how would it work
 
05:42:17.750 --> 05:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
um if a chartered public school was to
 
05:42:20.390 --> 05:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
submit an application for building Aid
 
05:42:21.948 --> 05:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
according to the schedule and I think
 
05:42:24.288 --> 05:42:24.298 align:start position:0%
this is a really good improvement over
 
05:42:28.430 --> 05:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
over the um over the existing lot which
 
05:42:30.948 --> 05:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
is sort of tough to read right but how
 
05:42:32.628 --> 05:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
would it work for a chartered school
 
05:42:36.288 --> 05:42:36.298 align:start position:0%
application and then you know as as it
 
05:42:38.750 --> 05:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
sort of enables it online it's 14 15 on
 
05:42:42.170 --> 05:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
the first page and then how it would go
 
05:42:44.990 --> 05:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
through the application process and the
 
05:42:45.000 --> 05:42:46.550 align:start position:0%
through the application process and the
ranking

05:42:46.550 --> 05:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
ranking
 
05:42:50.810 --> 05:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
um as as defined on page four and in
 
05:42:54.890 --> 05:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
particularly lines 12 and 21 where in
 
05:42:56.868 --> 05:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
factors in a school district's fiscal
 
05:42:56.878 --> 05:42:58.550 align:start position:0%
factors in a school district's fiscal
capacity

05:42:58.550 --> 05:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
05:43:01.730 --> 05:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
um based on measurable criteria how that
 
05:43:04.430 --> 05:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
would apply and then line 21 any other
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
criteria that the State Board of
 
05:43:08.510 --> 05:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
Education made May determine is
 
05:43:11.390 --> 05:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
necessary how would all that work for
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
Charter application I guess in view also
 
05:43:18.590 --> 05:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
of the um the federal grants that um
 
05:43:21.230 --> 05:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal committee has accepted
 
05:43:24.350 --> 05:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
for um for Charter Schools over the last
 
05:43:26.990 --> 05:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
biennium and um
 
05:43:30.530 --> 05:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
and uh and as we've seen some Charter
 
05:43:34.850 --> 05:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
Schools dissolve what would become of um
 
05:43:39.470 --> 05:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
of a um of a capital asset that was was
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
funded at least at 30 percent with uh
 
05:43:44.208 --> 05:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
with State funds I know there's some
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
some uh Charter dissolution bills not to
 
05:43:49.910 --> 05:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
force Charters into dissolution but to
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
clarify what would happen
 
05:43:53.930 --> 05:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
um you know in those events what would
 
05:43:53.940 --> 05:43:55.010 align:start position:0%
um you know in those events what would
happen

05:43:55.010 --> 05:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:43:57.530 --> 05:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
well those are lots of questions
 
05:44:00.650 --> 05:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
um so so how how does it work for a
 
05:44:03.650 --> 05:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
charter to navigate right so currently
 
05:44:05.448 --> 05:44:05.458 align:start position:0%
charter schools are not eligible for
 
05:44:07.310 --> 05:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
building Aid not because of the building
 
05:44:09.650 --> 05:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
Aid law but because of a charter school
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
law that prevents them from applying to
 
05:44:13.850 --> 05:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
building Aid and I'll be up here again
 
05:44:15.770 --> 05:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
for your next bill as well
 
05:44:16.730 --> 05:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:44:16.740 --> 05:44:17.448 align:start position:0%
um but
um

05:44:17.448 --> 05:44:17.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:19.670 --> 05:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
so this really just targets the the
 
05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
timeline but when I actually started my
 
05:44:22.558 --> 05:44:23.810 align:start position:0%
timeline but when I actually started my
position

05:44:23.810 --> 05:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:44:26.150 --> 05:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
um which was in 2015
 
05:44:28.310 --> 05:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
um it clearly says in the building Aid
 
05:44:30.288 --> 05:44:30.298 align:start position:0%
law that charter schools are eligible
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
for building Aid because it gives grants
 
05:44:35.990 --> 05:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
them 30 eligible funds so for this bill
 
05:44:37.970 --> 05:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
that wasn't changed it's in the existing
 
05:44:37.980 --> 05:44:39.230 align:start position:0%
that wasn't changed it's in the existing
law

05:44:39.230 --> 05:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:44:41.390 --> 05:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
um should the charter school law ever
 
05:44:43.368 --> 05:44:43.378 align:start position:0%
change they would be eligible for
 
05:44:47.330 --> 05:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
building Aid uh and uh but as for the
 
05:44:49.430 --> 05:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
ranking criteria
 
05:44:49.440 --> 05:44:50.090 align:start position:0%
ranking criteria
um

05:44:50.090 --> 05:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:52.730 --> 05:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
are I'd have to review our laws our laws
 
05:44:55.788 --> 05:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
are no I'm not sorry not our laws are
 
05:44:57.890 --> 05:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
um construction rules to see the
 
05:44:59.868 --> 05:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
construction rules more defined more
 
05:45:02.030 --> 05:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
clearly about the ranking but that is
 
05:45:03.288 --> 05:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
actually something we should probably
 
05:45:05.510 --> 05:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
take a look at because we haven't been
 
05:45:07.610 --> 05:45:07.620 align:start position:0%
looking at it at the eyes of charter
 
05:45:09.110 --> 05:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
schools because we know that they're not
 
05:45:11.448 --> 05:45:11.458 align:start position:0%
eligible for building Aid
 
05:45:14.448 --> 05:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
um but certainly it's an easy fix on our
 
05:45:16.490 --> 05:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
um on our Regulatory and not in the
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
state law
 
05:45:20.330 --> 05:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
and then I'll follow up on that does
 
05:45:23.628 --> 05:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
does dissolution factor into either um
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
either you know recovery of assets as
 
05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
far as as far as the the building aid
 
05:45:33.770 --> 05:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
program or the charter
 
05:45:33.780 --> 05:45:34.610 align:start position:0%
program or the charter
um

05:45:34.610 --> 05:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:37.010 --> 05:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question so
 
05:45:40.610 --> 05:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
um the the building Aid
 
05:45:44.030 --> 05:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
um law has a penalty in it it's in a
 
05:45:45.288 --> 05:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
different section but it essentially
 
05:45:47.690 --> 05:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
requires that school district charter
 
05:45:49.010 --> 05:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
school would have to use the facility
 
05:45:51.110 --> 05:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
for 20 years
 
05:45:52.850 --> 05:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
um uh or more or pay the whole thing
 
05:45:56.868 --> 05:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
back now that's a pretty hard ask when a
 
05:45:59.330 --> 05:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
school is closing down
 
05:46:01.788 --> 05:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
um usually for lots of
 
05:46:03.948 --> 05:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
um economic reasons and so forth
 
05:46:03.958 --> 05:46:05.330 align:start position:0%
um economic reasons and so forth
typically

05:46:05.330 --> 05:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
typically
 
05:46:07.010 --> 05:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:46:09.110 --> 05:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
um what the Department of Education has
 
05:46:14.090 --> 05:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
withheld funds for those projects but in
 
05:46:16.190 --> 05:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
our current
 
05:46:16.200 --> 05:46:17.030 align:start position:0%
our current
um

05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:20.868 --> 05:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
tale we in our old program prior to 2013
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
when we were building all but five
 
05:46:25.970 --> 05:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
schools now are under this other side of
 
05:46:28.128 --> 05:46:28.138 align:start position:0%
things where we were paying uh on the
 
05:46:29.990 --> 05:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
bond for 20 years a portion of their
 
05:46:33.530 --> 05:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
payment so what we have done is on those
 
05:46:35.390 --> 05:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
projects that have closed for the public
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
schools that have closed we've just
 
05:46:39.470 --> 05:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
stopped paying them the building Aid so
 
05:46:42.230 --> 05:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
if they remained open 18 years we would
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
have just not paid them year 19 and
 
05:46:46.610 --> 05:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
you're 20 on their 20-year Bond
 
05:46:49.270 --> 05:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
um it certainly was easier to do that
 
05:46:53.390 --> 05:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
than this model of paying 80 up front 20
 
05:46:56.868 --> 05:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
upon completion then at year 15 asking
 
05:46:59.810 --> 05:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
for you know a quarter of it back
 
05:47:03.530 --> 05:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
um it it is um I acknowledge that would
 
05:47:05.570 --> 05:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
be a difficult conversation the law does
 
05:47:06.948 --> 05:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
say that those school districts are
 
05:47:09.288 --> 05:47:09.298 align:start position:0%
required to pay pay it back
 
05:47:12.230 --> 05:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
um and I know last year's that Charter
 
05:47:13.610 --> 05:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
School bill again maybe I could talk
 
05:47:15.110 --> 05:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
about this more in the next bill but the
 
05:47:16.910 --> 05:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
that Charter School bill that's being
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
heard after this there was certainly
 
05:47:21.350 --> 05:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
some concerns about dissolution like for
 
05:47:23.090 --> 05:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
charter schools because they might be
 
05:47:24.830 --> 05:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
closing more frequently than public
 
05:47:24.840 --> 05:47:25.910 align:start position:0%
closing more frequently than public
schools

05:47:25.910 --> 05:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:47:28.430 --> 05:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
um and I I actually think the bill does
 
05:47:30.948 --> 05:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
a good job of addressing that okay great
 
05:47:32.390 --> 05:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much but this bill does
 
05:47:35.208 --> 05:47:35.218 align:start position:0%
not it's really
 
05:47:36.830 --> 05:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
um if both of those bills were to pass
 
05:47:38.390 --> 05:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
then these two would obviously have to
 
05:47:39.770 --> 05:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
merge together
 
05:47:41.990 --> 05:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
because they're both 198.15 right
 
05:47:44.208 --> 05:47:44.218 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli you recognize for a
 
05:47:46.610 --> 05:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
05:47:48.410 --> 05:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
with the 80 percent
 
05:47:51.230 --> 05:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
being paid up front and 20 upon
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
completion at this point
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
um is that a better process for the
 
05:47:58.390 --> 05:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
state and for the district than
 
05:48:00.830 --> 05:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
spreading it out over
 
05:48:04.310 --> 05:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
a period of time 20 years let's say
 
05:48:06.410 --> 05:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
well I guess I can just give me you my
 
05:48:08.690 --> 05:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
opinion on that ultimately
 
05:48:10.970 --> 05:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
um we can work with whatever process
 
05:48:14.810 --> 05:48:14.820 align:start position:0%
that you all uh decide on I have heard
 
05:48:17.448 --> 05:48:17.458 align:start position:0%
back from school districts that you know
 
05:48:19.070 --> 05:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
you have to work through the tail and
 
05:48:20.628 --> 05:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of pain working through
 
05:48:22.190 --> 05:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
the tail because nobody feels like
 
05:48:23.690 --> 05:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
there's enough money because we're
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
giving it away to past projects but I
 
05:48:28.128 --> 05:48:28.138 align:start position:0%
think for the most part
 
05:48:29.690 --> 05:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
um a lot of savings comes to the
 
05:48:32.448 --> 05:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
taxpayer comes to the school district if
 
05:48:34.670 --> 05:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
they are getting 80 percent of their
 
05:48:37.970 --> 05:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
Grant up front uh and the only time it
 
05:48:41.390 --> 05:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
seems beneficial is when you're further
 
05:48:43.010 --> 05:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
down on the list and you really wish the
 
05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
money was spread out
 
05:48:47.690 --> 05:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
um I I think most school districts if
 
05:48:49.070 --> 05:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
not all the school districts that I've
 
05:48:51.110 --> 05:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
talked to that have received Aid I mean
 
05:48:53.170 --> 05:48:53.180 align:start position:0%
there's a big savings in getting
 
05:48:55.128 --> 05:48:55.138 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollars and not having to
 
05:48:56.570 --> 05:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
bond that amount and not have to pay
 
05:48:58.390 --> 05:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
interest on it for 20 years
 
05:49:00.670 --> 05:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:49:03.048 --> 05:49:03.058 align:start position:0%
receiversary representative yeah thank
 
05:49:04.010 --> 05:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
05:49:06.170 --> 05:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair right along that that same
 
05:49:07.788 --> 05:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
line of questioning that representative
 
05:49:11.750 --> 05:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli um just asked you know that's
 
05:49:15.850 --> 05:49:15.860 align:start position:0%
we've we've gone from a uh a 20-year
 
05:49:19.010 --> 05:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
amortization or 20-year payment uh plan
 
05:49:21.170 --> 05:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
which I think was consistent with a lot
 
05:49:24.770 --> 05:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
of the um uh the bonds that that school
 
05:49:26.750 --> 05:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
just would use to finance their portion
 
05:49:28.850 --> 05:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
of the or to finance the construction
 
05:49:34.128 --> 05:49:34.138 align:start position:0%
costs uh to uh 80 uh you know 80 20 all
 
05:49:37.070 --> 05:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
of it you know essentially up front and
 
05:49:40.250 --> 05:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and and obviously um there would be
 
05:49:42.770 --> 05:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
some savings you know in terms of um you
 
05:49:44.868 --> 05:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
know interest costs that that you know
 
05:49:47.390 --> 05:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
you know would accumulate over over over
 
05:49:50.330 --> 05:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
a 20-year uh period
 
05:49:52.548 --> 05:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
um but you know then again a lot a lot
 
05:49:55.128 --> 05:49:55.138 align:start position:0%
rests on interest rates uh you know too
 
05:49:58.190 --> 05:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
and um and and
 
05:50:01.788 --> 05:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
and and so when we when we went to that
 
05:50:04.010 --> 05:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
like you as you've said
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
um it now limits the number of projects
 
05:50:10.490 --> 05:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
we're able to go after in a year you've
 
05:50:12.170 --> 05:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about how many
 
05:50:14.990 --> 05:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
projects are in the um you know how many
 
05:50:18.110 --> 05:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
applications have have been um have been
 
05:50:21.048 --> 05:50:21.058 align:start position:0%
submitted but uh but let's sort of you
 
05:50:23.208 --> 05:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
know looking down the road you know over
 
05:50:25.490 --> 05:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
the horizon a little bit further
 
05:50:28.850 --> 05:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
um how many how many school buildings do
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have across the state and what's
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
their average you know and it may be
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
sort of like an engineer you know a
 
05:50:38.570 --> 05:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
little bit of back in the napkin what's
 
05:50:41.330 --> 05:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
their average age and how many do you
 
05:50:44.690 --> 05:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
think we we may need to um to how many
 
05:50:46.610 --> 05:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
projects do you think may come up over
 
05:50:48.110 --> 05:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
the next decade
 
05:50:50.330 --> 05:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh that's a great question
 
05:50:51.830 --> 05:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
05:50:54.650 --> 05:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
um we have looked at like what I
 
05:50:56.810 --> 05:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
consider a sustainability snapshot and
 
05:50:59.030 --> 05:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
trying to think of like what is the big
 
05:51:01.190 --> 05:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
picture and if you look at the life of
 
05:51:02.810 --> 05:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
the a building
 
05:51:06.890 --> 05:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
um being 40 to 50 years we have 450 or
 
05:51:06.900 --> 05:51:08.030 align:start position:0%
um being 40 to 50 years we have 450 or
more

05:51:08.030 --> 05:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
um schools and
 
05:51:13.190 --> 05:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
um if you just base I mean I can kind of
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
take you through those numbers because I
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
have my cheat sheet here
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
um but if you just look we have 450
 
05:51:21.410 --> 05:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
school buildings roughly we have about
 
05:51:24.530 --> 05:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
165 000 students so we're already
 
05:51:26.090 --> 05:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
talking about decline the enrollment so
 
05:51:27.530 --> 05:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
this is the number of students we
 
05:51:30.530 --> 05:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
actually have you can place a cost per
 
05:51:33.530 --> 05:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
square foot and a a space amount per
 
05:51:36.890 --> 05:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
student and you come up with
 
05:51:41.570 --> 05:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
um 23 million square feet on average 550
 
05:51:44.150 --> 05:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
dollars a square foot you come up with
 
05:51:47.708 --> 05:51:47.718 align:start position:0%
about 12.7 billion dollars to
 
05:51:52.910 --> 05:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
to construct all our public schools at
 
05:51:54.830 --> 05:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
once right obviously that's not
 
05:51:57.410 --> 05:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
happening they are lasting up to 50
 
05:52:00.230 --> 05:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
years 40 to 50 years so if you take that
 
05:52:03.410 --> 05:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
number and divide it by 4 40 years you
 
05:52:06.470 --> 05:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
come up with about 318 million dollars a
 
05:52:08.270 --> 05:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
year so I guess that's probably the
 
05:52:10.430 --> 05:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
number you're looking at 318 million
 
05:52:12.110 --> 05:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
dollars a year now that's not the state
 
05:52:14.810 --> 05:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
share if you apply the state share of
 
05:52:18.708 --> 05:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
our average share is 38 so that is let
 
05:52:20.208 --> 05:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
me do that math real quickly and I had
 
05:52:23.628 --> 05:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
the 30 A's a hundred and uh let's see 21
 
05:52:26.150 --> 05:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
million a year for the state share
 
05:52:28.190 --> 05:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
um so you know
 
05:52:31.850 --> 05:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
um again that's a very rough number uh
 
05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
and that would be spread out over over
 
05:52:35.810 --> 05:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
over 40 years you could do that
 
05:52:38.750 --> 05:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
calculation with 30 you could do it over
 
05:52:42.288 --> 05:52:42.298 align:start position:0%
50 years or so forth but regardless of
 
05:52:44.810 --> 05:52:44.820 align:start position:0%
all of that if you just took only
 
05:52:46.368 --> 05:52:46.378 align:start position:0%
because I can do this math in my head a
 
05:52:48.548 --> 05:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
lot better if you took
 
05:52:51.708 --> 05:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
450 schools and said they need to be
 
05:52:54.650 --> 05:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
rebuilt every 50 years that's nine
 
05:52:57.830 --> 05:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
schools a year right 450 divided by nine
 
05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's nine schools a year so a biennium
 
05:53:02.810 --> 05:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
that's about 18 schools a year so our
 
05:53:05.270 --> 05:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
previous list of 17 is probably what
 
05:53:07.788 --> 05:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
we'll see over time I wouldn't be
 
05:53:10.670 --> 05:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
surprised if we see a little more in the
 
05:53:13.548 --> 05:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
next 10 years because we had a 10-year
 
05:53:16.490 --> 05:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
moratorium I'd say if you were to look I
 
05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire should be really
 
05:53:19.368 --> 05:53:19.378 align:start position:0%
proud of this personally I think if you
 
05:53:23.208 --> 05:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
look prior to 2009 from the 1940s all
 
05:53:25.368 --> 05:53:25.378 align:start position:0%
the way up to 2009 before the moratorium
 
05:53:29.330 --> 05:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
the legislature funded based on need and
 
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
so our schools are in really good
 
05:53:31.440 --> 05:53:32.810 align:start position:0%
so our schools are in really good
condition

05:53:32.810 --> 05:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
condition
 
05:53:34.730 --> 05:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
um up until 2009 but you know that there
 
05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
were schools that were getting ready to
 
05:53:39.770 --> 05:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
apply because they had older buildings
 
05:53:41.570 --> 05:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
and those are probably the schools but
 
05:53:43.548 --> 05:53:43.558 align:start position:0%
they didn't because of the moratorium so
 
05:53:44.990 --> 05:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
most likely there'll be a little bit of
 
05:53:46.910 --> 05:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
a blip but
 
05:53:48.948 --> 05:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
um big picture when not talking about
 
05:53:50.810 --> 05:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
always brand new schools we're talking
 
05:53:52.970 --> 05:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
about substantial Renovations sometimes
 
05:53:54.410 --> 05:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
too so so
 
05:53:57.288 --> 05:53:57.298 align:start position:0%
follow up on that so so you said 17 over
 
05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
biennium about nine a year would would
 
05:54:05.690 --> 05:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
make sense and um and and I think
 
05:54:08.208 --> 05:54:08.218 align:start position:0%
um it was either your earlier uh
 
05:54:11.448 --> 05:54:11.458 align:start position:0%
testimony or or maybe uh maybe
 
05:54:14.750 --> 05:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd's uh testimony that
 
05:54:17.030 --> 05:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
that suggested under the current budget
 
05:54:18.890 --> 05:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
we might be able to
 
05:54:21.288 --> 05:54:21.298 align:start position:0%
I mean Concord Scout is one of the one
 
05:54:23.270 --> 05:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the applications and that could use
 
05:54:26.810 --> 05:54:26.820 align:start position:0%
up the entire you know the the you know
 
05:54:30.410 --> 05:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
the entire bucket here and um and so in
 
05:54:33.650 --> 05:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
one biennium that would be that would be
 
05:54:36.770 --> 05:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
one project leaving 16
 
05:54:38.750 --> 05:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
not funded
 
05:54:41.448 --> 05:54:41.458 align:start position:0%
and two two years from now we'll have
 
05:54:44.690 --> 05:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
another batch of 17.
 
05:54:49.850 --> 05:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
coming coming in and so so is is this a
 
05:54:53.350 --> 05:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
a situation that that that that that
 
05:54:56.990 --> 05:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
develops and compounds because of the 80
 
05:55:00.650 --> 05:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
20 the the the the paying all of it up
 
05:55:03.230 --> 05:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
front as opposed to something where
 
05:55:05.150 --> 05:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're able to chip away at more of these
 
05:55:07.730 --> 05:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
projects over a 20-year
 
05:55:07.740 --> 05:55:08.628 align:start position:0%
projects over a 20-year
um

05:55:08.628 --> 05:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:10.610 --> 05:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's a good question for
 
05:55:12.288 --> 05:55:12.298 align:start position:0%
you all I guess I would just point out
 
05:55:13.910 --> 05:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
two things they'll always be more coming
 
05:55:16.010 --> 05:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
there'll be some you get like what
 
05:55:17.628 --> 05:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
you're saying is true if there's not
 
05:55:19.368 --> 05:55:19.378 align:start position:0%
enough money they'll create a backlog
 
05:55:21.410 --> 05:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
but some school districts are going to
 
05:55:22.910 --> 05:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
move forward with their projects without
 
05:55:25.730 --> 05:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
stating they have to
 
05:55:28.070 --> 05:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
um somebody asked earlier about jumping
 
05:55:29.510 --> 05:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
the list the department of education's
 
05:55:31.910 --> 05:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
rules do allow uh projects with higher
 
05:55:35.628 --> 05:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
Life Safety uh points to to jump on the
 
05:55:35.638 --> 05:55:36.830 align:start position:0%
Life Safety uh points to to jump on the
list

05:55:36.830 --> 05:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
list
 
05:55:41.090 --> 05:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
um so sure there'll be a backlog I'm I I
 
05:55:43.910 --> 05:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
don't know as if funding them
 
05:55:45.850 --> 05:55:45.860 align:start position:0%
um over a 20-year
 
05:55:48.770 --> 05:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
or I'm not sure it really matters the
 
05:55:51.288 --> 05:55:51.298 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism they'll always
 
05:55:53.628 --> 05:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
you're either going to create a tale or
 
05:55:56.150 --> 05:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to create a backlog
 
05:55:56.160 --> 05:55:57.170 align:start position:0%
you're going to create a backlog
um

05:55:57.170 --> 05:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:00.670 --> 05:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right so thank you very much
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay further question well reps and like
 
05:56:05.208 --> 05:56:05.218 align:start position:0%
us had her hand up for several times
 
05:56:08.628 --> 05:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
here thank you chairman
 
05:56:11.810 --> 05:56:11.820 align:start position:0%
um back to a couple conversations ago
 
05:56:14.208 --> 05:56:14.218 align:start position:0%
when you were talking about
 
05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
let's say we did those schools and there
 
05:56:17.830 --> 05:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
was a million left
 
05:56:20.990 --> 05:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering what happens to the
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
million if the school's coming after
 
05:56:27.110 --> 05:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
that are all like no we really need the
 
05:56:28.730 --> 05:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
30 million
 
05:56:31.850 --> 05:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
um does that can that can we apply that
 
05:56:34.850 --> 05:56:34.860 align:start position:0%
million then to the tail do we just lose
 
05:56:37.970 --> 05:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
that million we don't appropriate it
 
05:56:40.490 --> 05:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
what happens yeah it's decided during
 
05:56:43.070 --> 05:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
the next biennium budget so what you
 
05:56:44.628 --> 05:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
can't do is you can't take that and
 
05:56:46.610 --> 05:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
apply it to the tail because school
 
05:56:48.230 --> 05:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
school districts don't have the ability
 
05:56:49.910 --> 05:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
to pay those bonds off early because
 
05:56:53.090 --> 05:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
it's gone but that money so this last
 
05:56:54.890 --> 05:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
biennium that extra money was about
 
05:56:57.230 --> 05:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
seven hundred thousand dollars and that
 
05:56:59.690 --> 05:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
rolled into the next but the next budget
 
05:57:02.150 --> 05:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
cycle so it added to the building Aid
 
05:57:03.708 --> 05:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
appropriation is what they decided to do
 
05:57:06.590 --> 05:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
that biennium what we can't do
 
05:57:07.610 --> 05:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
um because some people would say well
 
05:57:08.930 --> 05:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you just have given it to
 
05:57:10.610 --> 05:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
the school to so they could have started
 
05:57:12.350 --> 05:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
it but what we don't know is if we'll
 
05:57:14.208 --> 05:57:14.218 align:start position:0%
get any more and obviously the school
 
05:57:16.548 --> 05:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
district needs a guarantee that the full
 
05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
30 is coming right right thank you yeah
 
05:57:22.670 --> 05:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
good question and I um sorry I have to
 
05:57:25.128 --> 05:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
um just bring up a point and I don't
 
05:57:26.510 --> 05:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
mean to pick on the Concord School
 
05:57:26.520 --> 05:57:27.650 align:start position:0%
mean to pick on the Concord School
District

05:57:27.650 --> 05:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:57:27.660 --> 05:57:28.910 align:start position:0%
District
um but

05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:57:31.610 --> 05:57:31.620 align:start position:0%
um the list just keep in mind that the
 
05:57:34.610 --> 05:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
list the amount of Aid that is being
 
05:57:37.610 --> 05:57:37.620 align:start position:0%
asked for on that list is simply the
 
05:57:41.030 --> 05:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
building Aid percentage times what their
 
05:57:44.030 --> 05:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
project cost is the Department of
 
05:57:47.330 --> 05:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
Education has yet to apply maximum
 
05:57:49.850 --> 05:57:49.860 align:start position:0%
square footage per pupil maximum
 
05:57:53.208 --> 05:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
construction cost per square foot so
 
05:57:55.730 --> 05:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
um I guess I wish that I had those
 
05:57:57.890 --> 05:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
numbers for you at this time but we
 
05:57:59.930 --> 05:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
review applications from the top and
 
05:58:01.788 --> 05:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
work through and we're I'm through like
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
three applications now so that detailed
 
05:58:06.830 --> 05:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
review will eventually come for them
 
05:58:09.770 --> 05:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
they're aware of what that number might
 
05:58:11.930 --> 05:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
be as well as other applicants on there
 
05:58:14.390 --> 05:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
but just keep in mind you know if a
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
school were to build a larger Auditorium
 
05:58:18.410 --> 05:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
that the state wouldn't pay for that's
 
05:58:19.910 --> 05:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
not going to show up on the list until
 
05:58:22.250 --> 05:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
we fully review the project and say oh
 
05:58:24.170 --> 05:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
this piece is not eligible for building
 
05:58:26.208 --> 05:58:26.218 align:start position:0%
Aid I guess I'd just like to point that
 
05:58:28.610 --> 05:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
out because it is a big ask I think we
 
05:58:30.788 --> 05:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
understand that okay
 
05:58:33.708 --> 05:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um just one
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
clarification with the uh the 80 20 any
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
split now does that mean in the new
 
05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
money that's going out there will not be
 
05:58:45.170 --> 05:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
a new tail
 
05:58:48.350 --> 05:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
rex that means once this tail is gone
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be when 2041 2041
 
05:58:55.910 --> 05:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
however keep in mind 2041 10 years
 
05:58:58.850 --> 05:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
before 2041 2041 when's that ever going
 
05:58:59.750 --> 05:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
05:59:01.490 --> 05:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
um uh they'll Replay that in 10 years
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sure or how many every years
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
um but keep in mind that's because of
 
05:59:09.170 --> 05:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
just a few schools had 30-year bonds a
 
05:59:12.350 --> 05:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
bulk of the tail really gets paid off by
 
05:59:15.770 --> 05:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
2029 2030 and then it gets really small
 
05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
it looks you know according to my
 
05:59:20.208 --> 05:59:20.218 align:start position:0%
numbers it's probably below
 
05:59:24.470 --> 05:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
um two it looks like it's below uh 5
 
05:59:29.110 --> 05:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
million in 2030. so so but no new tail
 
05:59:32.810 --> 05:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you so that's a new slogan there
 
05:59:34.570 --> 05:59:34.580 align:start position:0%
no New Deal
 
05:59:36.350 --> 05:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
05:59:38.150 --> 05:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you
 
05:59:40.368 --> 05:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
chairman good afternoon everything a
 
05:59:41.868 --> 05:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
little while ago a couple hours ago now
 
05:59:43.548 --> 05:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
but a little while ago you you were
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
talking about the 80 20 and the default
 
05:59:48.890 --> 05:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
um and the payback on the default how
 
05:59:51.770 --> 05:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
how often does that happen in uh in the
 
05:59:53.570 --> 05:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
last 10 years the school system has
 
05:59:55.368 --> 05:59:55.378 align:start position:0%
actually defaulted on their lawn and
 
06:00:06.048 --> 06:00:06.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:09.470 --> 06:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
well uh Berlin just closed Brown
 
06:00:11.750 --> 06:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
Elementary School I can't remember if
 
06:00:13.610 --> 06:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
they had building Aid
 
06:00:15.470 --> 06:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
um Hallsville School of Manchester just
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
closed they were receiving Bill the aid
 
06:00:18.718 --> 06:00:20.990 align:start position:0%
closed they were receiving Bill the aid
um

06:00:20.990 --> 06:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:22.128 --> 06:00:22.138 align:start position:0%
um those are the two that I remember
 
06:00:24.770 --> 06:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
most recently so it happens but it's not
 
06:00:26.690 --> 06:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's not frequent and a lot one of those
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
schools I can't remember which one was
 
06:00:30.770 --> 06:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
at like 18 years since they received
 
06:00:33.410 --> 06:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
building Aid thank you thank you and if
 
06:00:36.048 --> 06:00:36.058 align:start position:0%
your default in that 20-year time since
 
06:00:37.730 --> 06:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
you got that money guess who pays it
 
06:00:37.740 --> 06:00:39.530 align:start position:0%
you got that money guess who pays it
back

06:00:39.530 --> 06:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
back
 
06:00:40.970 --> 06:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
the district
 
06:00:42.590 --> 06:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
06:00:46.730 --> 06:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
so Rick yes just a quick comment I think
 
06:00:49.250 --> 06:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
addressed to representative miler's um
 
06:00:52.250 --> 06:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
no new tell uh type of thing
 
06:00:52.260 --> 06:00:53.170 align:start position:0%
no new tell uh type of thing
um

06:00:53.170 --> 06:00:53.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:56.390 --> 06:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
bonds aren't necessarily bad and tail
 
06:00:59.448 --> 06:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily bad in this um in this
 
06:01:01.250 --> 06:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
type of case because these assets are
 
06:01:04.190 --> 06:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
durable and and last as you said over a
 
06:01:07.430 --> 06:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
period of 40 years so in this case all
 
06:01:10.128 --> 06:01:10.138 align:start position:0%
the assets are actually going to have a
 
06:01:13.850 --> 06:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
have a lifespan of of 20 years in excess
 
06:01:16.670 --> 06:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
of the um the the
 
06:01:19.310 --> 06:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
um the last payment if there were a
 
06:01:22.788 --> 06:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
20-year sort of amortization of this I'm
 
06:01:25.010 --> 06:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
not a financial analyst so I'm you know
 
06:01:26.690 --> 06:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
and neither am I not gonna whatever you
 
06:01:26.700 --> 06:01:27.548 align:start position:0%
and neither am I not gonna whatever you
decide

06:01:27.548 --> 06:01:27.558 align:start position:0%
decide
 
06:01:30.890 --> 06:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
but I think I'm good but but I just I
 
06:01:32.330 --> 06:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
just want to sort of put it out there
 
06:01:35.810 --> 06:01:35.820 align:start position:0%
that I think it is worthy of a debate
 
06:01:38.030 --> 06:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
um uh you know taking a look at the
 
06:01:40.850 --> 06:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
number of projects and the impact on
 
06:01:43.010 --> 06:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and the fact that you you're
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
basically funding the creation of an
 
06:01:47.930 --> 06:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
asset that has a lifespan that's or
 
06:01:51.708 --> 06:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
usable design life you know double the
 
06:01:56.570 --> 06:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
the payment term and um and you know as
 
06:01:58.490 --> 06:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
as I think you've made really clear Amy
 
06:02:00.948 --> 06:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of need that's
 
06:02:03.110 --> 06:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
going to be that has built up and will
 
06:02:06.110 --> 06:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
continue to build up and uh and it might
 
06:02:08.750 --> 06:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
be it might be valuable to see like how
 
06:02:12.170 --> 06:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
this would model out over over the next
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
40 years let's say if we were doing an
 
06:02:18.470 --> 06:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
80 20 versus a 20-year type thing how
 
06:02:20.570 --> 06:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
many projects would we would we be able
 
06:02:22.670 --> 06:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
to go after what would the cost to the
 
06:02:25.190 --> 06:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
state be what would the cost to local
 
06:02:27.110 --> 06:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers
 
06:02:29.330 --> 06:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
um be because I think local taxpayers do
 
06:02:33.170 --> 06:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
receive a benefit when um when when they
 
06:02:36.110 --> 06:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
when they receive a building Grant from
 
06:02:38.750 --> 06:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
the state whether that's 80 20 or you
 
06:02:38.760 --> 06:02:39.410 align:start position:0%
the state whether that's 80 20 or you
know

06:02:39.410 --> 06:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:02:42.170 --> 06:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
um uh a um you know four percent a year
 
06:02:44.448 --> 06:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
over or five percent a year over 20
 
06:02:46.670 --> 06:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
years and
 
06:02:51.048 --> 06:02:51.058 align:start position:0%
uh you know especially if if it means
 
06:02:55.610 --> 06:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
that in some instances a lot of projects
 
06:02:57.230 --> 06:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
are not going to receive a state Grant
 
06:03:00.230 --> 06:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
so so I I'm just requesting that just
 
06:03:03.250 --> 06:03:03.260 align:start position:0%
remember what our debt was back in 2019
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
540 million dollars but that was a
 
06:03:09.288 --> 06:03:09.298 align:start position:0%
different tale that was when the state
 
06:03:12.230 --> 06:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
took out its own we are borrowing from
 
06:03:16.970 --> 06:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
yes so so there's really two tails two
 
06:03:20.868 --> 06:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
tails yes here yeah and and so I'm just
 
06:03:22.970 --> 06:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
sort of saying that it's not that I
 
06:03:25.010 --> 06:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
think we are we are on the Department of
 
06:03:27.288 --> 06:03:27.298 align:start position:0%
Education we'll process you know the the
 
06:03:29.628 --> 06:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
time this bill focuses on the timeline
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
for us just to process it whether it's
 
06:03:35.270 --> 06:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
80 20 or their tail mechanism really it
 
06:03:37.070 --> 06:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't really impact the Department of
 
06:03:37.080 --> 06:03:38.270 align:start position:0%
doesn't really impact the Department of
Education

06:03:38.270 --> 06:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
Education
 
06:03:41.150 --> 06:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
um in the sense of we will review these
 
06:03:43.730 --> 06:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
applications as sure but from a policy
 
06:03:46.730 --> 06:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
perspective that you know in this room
 
06:03:50.230 --> 06:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's two very different policies
 
06:03:54.650 --> 06:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
one more card in this too so I want to
 
06:03:56.930 --> 06:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Amy very much for working with
 
06:03:59.090 --> 06:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
us on this uh your help is always
 
06:03:59.100 --> 06:04:00.890 align:start position:0%
us on this uh your help is always
appreciated

06:04:00.890 --> 06:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
06:04:02.930 --> 06:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure you'll be part of our
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
discussion here when we have further
 
06:04:08.810 --> 06:04:08.820 align:start position:0%
discussions on like somewhat 30 for
 
06:04:08.820 --> 06:04:11.030 align:start position:0%
discussions on like somewhat 30 for
everybody

06:04:11.030 --> 06:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
06:04:12.770 --> 06:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
you know that's another discussion so
 
06:04:20.570 --> 06:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:30.110 --> 06:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon education committee I'm
 
06:04:31.970 --> 06:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
going to be brief
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
I support this bill money again for the
 
06:04:37.150 --> 06:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
record I'm Eric power I'm from Brookline
 
06:04:39.590 --> 06:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
I was a civil engineer in the military
 
06:04:42.350 --> 06:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
so I construction is near and dear to me
 
06:04:44.890 --> 06:04:44.900 align:start position:0%
so in the 17
 
06:04:47.810 --> 06:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
applications that were put in
 
06:04:50.690 --> 06:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
four of them came from my our schools
 
06:04:53.330 --> 06:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
two from the Hollis Brookline Co-op and
 
06:04:55.670 --> 06:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
two from Brookline for all our schools
 
06:04:57.708 --> 06:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
that need the help and they were ranked
 
06:05:00.770 --> 06:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
14 15 16 and 17. so we were the bottom
 
06:05:04.548 --> 06:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
four so the reason I bring that up is I
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
think that you know having this
 
06:05:07.850 --> 06:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity every year instead of every
 
06:05:10.788 --> 06:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
two years is a good thing
 
06:05:14.270 --> 06:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
um so I also think you need to look at
 
06:05:15.770 --> 06:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
the I think it was mentioned by the
 
06:05:18.048 --> 06:05:18.058 align:start position:0%
previous speaker on page three about the
 
06:05:20.030 --> 06:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
contingency Warren articles I think you
 
06:05:22.970 --> 06:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
need to allow a school district to be
 
06:05:26.090 --> 06:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
able to do that to be able to approve a
 
06:05:28.310 --> 06:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
warrant article contingent on state aid
 
06:05:29.990 --> 06:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
being available
 
06:05:31.368 --> 06:05:31.378 align:start position:0%
um because that so you probably caught
 
06:05:32.990 --> 06:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
that one already the other thing I
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention on this is you know
 
06:05:38.270 --> 06:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
from a taxpayer perspective this is
 
06:05:40.610 --> 06:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
different than a a bond that you get the
 
06:05:42.650 --> 06:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
state aid over 20 years
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
so there needs to be transparency to
 
06:05:47.690 --> 06:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
taxpayers when they're voting for a bond
 
06:05:49.310 --> 06:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
saying yeah this is only going to cost
 
06:05:52.070 --> 06:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
you a nickel per thousand using the 80
 
06:05:55.250 --> 06:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
and then the 20 that you're getting
 
06:05:57.230 --> 06:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
kind of like you know you're only going
 
06:05:58.910 --> 06:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
to pay a little bit the first couple of
 
06:06:00.650 --> 06:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
years but when the full amount kicks in
 
06:06:03.350 --> 06:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
after the the whole 80 20 is kicked in
 
06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
however long it takes one two three
 
06:06:07.070 --> 06:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
years here's what you're going to pay
 
06:06:09.830 --> 06:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
and so I think we need to have caution
 
06:06:11.750 --> 06:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
or you know some explanation from the
 
06:06:14.090 --> 06:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Education or dra to make
 
06:06:16.190 --> 06:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
it clear this is different than the past
 
06:06:18.470 --> 06:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
this is new that when there's a bond
 
06:06:20.510 --> 06:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
proposed and they say well the tax if
 
06:06:22.250 --> 06:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
there's a tax impact notation and it
 
06:06:23.570 --> 06:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
just says yeah it's only a nickel per
 
06:06:26.330 --> 06:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
thousand but it turns into being 40
 
06:06:28.128 --> 06:06:28.138 align:start position:0%
cents per thousand when it fully kicks
 
06:06:29.810 --> 06:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
in people need to be aware of that so I
 
06:06:31.548 --> 06:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring that uh that point
 
06:06:32.750 --> 06:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
up I don't know if it needs to go in the
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
legislation or it's somewhere else
 
06:06:37.730 --> 06:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
and lastly I think the Improvement is
 
06:06:39.288 --> 06:06:39.298 align:start position:0%
good for this because having it every
 
06:06:40.548 --> 06:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
two years
 
06:06:44.690 --> 06:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
is a long time in construction and with
 
06:06:46.730 --> 06:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
school needs so having it having this
 
06:06:48.350 --> 06:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
bill go to every year I think is a
 
06:06:49.850 --> 06:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
really good thing
 
06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
um and I and I like the improvements
 
06:06:53.390 --> 06:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
that I've seen in the criteria in this
 
06:06:55.128 --> 06:06:55.138 align:start position:0%
bill and this bipartisan bill so I would
 
06:06:58.070 --> 06:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
recommend Auto pass with Amendment on
 
06:06:59.930 --> 06:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you very much thank you
 
06:07:04.070 --> 06:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
very much other questions uh Miss power
 
06:07:08.628 --> 06:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:10.310 --> 06:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
are there any other pink cards out on
 
06:07:10.320 --> 06:07:11.930 align:start position:0%
are there any other pink cards out on
452

06:07:11.930 --> 06:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
452
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
with that we're going to close this
 
06:07:13.200 --> 06:07:16.190 align:start position:0%
with that we're going to close this
hearing

06:07:16.190 --> 06:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:16.200 --> 06:07:37.730 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:07:37.730 --> 06:07:37.740 align:start position:0%

record my name is representative Maureen
 
06:08:26.270 --> 06:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
Mooney I'm from the town of Merrimack
 
06:08:28.670 --> 06:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
that Hillsborough County District number
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
12. I'm here as the prime sponsor and
 
06:08:35.208 --> 06:08:35.218 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of House Bill 354
 
06:08:37.910 --> 06:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
and act relative to chartered Public
 
06:08:41.270 --> 06:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
School eligibility for school building
 
06:08:45.530 --> 06:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
Aid I'm going to do this in three points
 
06:08:48.948 --> 06:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
three points to summarize this bill
 
06:08:53.350 --> 06:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
first and foremost this bill simply
 
06:08:57.590 --> 06:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
allows public chartered schools the
 
06:09:00.190 --> 06:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
ability to apply
 
06:09:03.948 --> 06:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
apply for school building Aid like all
 
06:09:05.690 --> 06:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
the traditional public schools in New
 
06:09:07.128 --> 06:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can
 
06:09:09.890 --> 06:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
just recently as I was sitting on my own
 
06:09:11.570 --> 06:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
committee house finance we had the
 
06:09:13.368 --> 06:09:13.378 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in front of us
 
06:09:16.490 --> 06:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
and I asked them Direct
 
06:09:19.128 --> 06:09:19.138 align:start position:0%
our public charter schools the only
 
06:09:22.128 --> 06:09:22.138 align:start position:0%
Public Schools excluded from applying
 
06:09:24.470 --> 06:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
for school building Aid
 
06:09:26.990 --> 06:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
the answer was yes
 
06:09:27.000 --> 06:09:28.730 align:start position:0%
the answer was yes
0.2

06:09:28.730 --> 06:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
0.2
 
06:09:32.890 --> 06:09:32.900 align:start position:0%
House Bill 354 is applicable to only
 
06:09:37.070 --> 06:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
only those public chartered schools that
 
06:09:40.070 --> 06:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
own their own buildings
 
06:09:43.310 --> 06:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
there aren't many but it is for them
 
06:09:46.850 --> 06:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
on page one of the Bell lines 14 through
 
06:09:50.208 --> 06:09:50.218 align:start position:0%
17 there is a very important section
 
06:09:54.230 --> 06:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
there it's Roman 2 hyphen a and that
 
06:09:58.788 --> 06:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
section was drafted and crafted based on
 
06:10:01.310 --> 06:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
discussions in this committee when I
 
06:10:04.670 --> 06:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
proposed a similar Bill last term it
 
06:10:06.590 --> 06:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that the public chartered
 
06:10:11.270 --> 06:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
school applying for the aid shall own
 
06:10:15.288 --> 06:10:15.298 align:start position:0%
its own building and shall be subject to
 
06:10:18.048 --> 06:10:18.058 align:start position:0%
a plan for disposition according to
 
06:10:19.730 --> 06:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
current law
 
06:10:22.250 --> 06:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
the grant payment is also spread out
 
06:10:25.368 --> 06:10:25.378 align:start position:0%
over a typical loan term
 
06:10:30.110 --> 06:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
and set in law at 30 percent of the cost
 
06:10:33.590 --> 06:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
of construction for chartered schools so
 
06:10:35.270 --> 06:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
they are capped
 
06:10:37.570 --> 06:10:37.580 align:start position:0%
but that leads to point three
 
06:10:40.128 --> 06:10:40.138 align:start position:0%
and very important well they're all
 
06:10:42.530 --> 06:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
important but this is important too
 
06:10:45.128 --> 06:10:45.138 align:start position:0%
House Bill fee 354
 
06:10:49.548 --> 06:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
corrects a glaring contradiction right
 
06:10:52.128 --> 06:10:52.138 align:start position:0%
now in current law
 
06:10:54.530 --> 06:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
currently there is a provision of law
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
that prohibits
 
06:10:58.490 --> 06:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
public chartered schools from receiving
 
06:10:58.500 --> 06:10:59.930 align:start position:0%
public chartered schools from receiving
aid

06:10:59.930 --> 06:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
aid
 
06:11:01.430 --> 06:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
06:11:04.670 --> 06:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
the section I just referenced there's a
 
06:11:06.410 --> 06:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
section on Aid
 
06:11:09.288 --> 06:11:09.298 align:start position:0%
actually referring to quote the amount
 
06:11:11.448 --> 06:11:11.458 align:start position:0%
of the grant to any public chartered
 
06:11:14.090 --> 06:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
school shall be at 30 percent of the
 
06:11:16.610 --> 06:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
eligible cost of construction
 
06:11:19.850 --> 06:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
well which is it you've got a contrast
 
06:11:22.670 --> 06:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
of one provision of law says they do not
 
06:11:25.910 --> 06:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
receive Charter Schools do not receive
 
06:11:28.190 --> 06:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
School building Aid and cannot apply for
 
06:11:30.048 --> 06:11:30.058 align:start position:0%
it and then you have another section
 
06:11:32.390 --> 06:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
that says they get 30 percent of their
 
06:11:36.288 --> 06:11:36.298 align:start position:0%
construction progress project
 
06:11:37.670 --> 06:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
Side Story
 
06:11:39.650 --> 06:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
we had a bill just recently we heard in
 
06:11:41.208 --> 06:11:41.218 align:start position:0%
house finance and the Department of
 
06:11:43.910 --> 06:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
Education was proposing it it was to
 
06:11:47.230 --> 06:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
hire somebody to re-codify the education
 
06:11:51.170 --> 06:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
statutes because they are unclear and
 
06:11:53.570 --> 06:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
somewhat contradictory
 
06:11:57.948 --> 06:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
you'll never guess which example they
 
06:12:02.390 --> 06:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
gave for this recodification position
 
06:12:04.070 --> 06:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
it was this
 
06:12:06.590 --> 06:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that in one section again it
 
06:12:10.670 --> 06:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
says no building aid for public charter
 
06:12:10.680 --> 06:12:11.810 align:start position:0%
says no building aid for public charter
schools

06:12:11.810 --> 06:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:12:14.208 --> 06:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
and then in another section of law it
 
06:12:15.890 --> 06:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
says they can but you know up to 30
 
06:12:15.900 --> 06:12:18.590 align:start position:0%
says they can but you know up to 30
percent

06:12:18.590 --> 06:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
in conclusion School building Aid is
 
06:12:22.910 --> 06:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
defined on the New Hampshire Department
 
06:12:26.590 --> 06:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
of education's website as quote program
 
06:12:31.070 --> 06:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
authorized by RSA 198 call in 15 hyphen
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
a through which the state of New
 
06:12:35.448 --> 06:12:35.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire provides financial assistance
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
to local school districts for the
 
06:12:39.650 --> 06:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
construction or substantial renovation
 
06:12:42.890 --> 06:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
of educational facilities for grades
 
06:12:42.900 --> 06:12:44.510 align:start position:0%
of educational facilities for grades
K-12

06:12:51.170 --> 06:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
this definition
 
06:12:53.330 --> 06:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
and clear up discrepancies in current
 
06:12:53.340 --> 06:12:54.288 align:start position:0%
and clear up discrepancies in current
law

06:12:54.288 --> 06:12:54.298 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:12:57.048 --> 06:12:57.058 align:start position:0%
by adding chartered public schools that
 
06:12:59.030 --> 06:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
are and continue to be significant
 
06:13:01.548 --> 06:13:01.558 align:start position:0%
contributors as K-12 New Hampshire
 
06:13:04.070 --> 06:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
public schools with that I conclude my
 
06:13:05.930 --> 06:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you and thank you all
 
06:13:07.730 --> 06:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
for listening thank you very much are
 
06:13:10.310 --> 06:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
06:13:13.070 --> 06:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Miler thank you for
 
06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
being here and thank you for taking my
 
06:13:16.970 --> 06:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
question how many Charter Schools own
 
06:13:19.990 --> 06:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:22.490 --> 06:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
The Unofficial answer from what I know
 
06:13:25.070 --> 06:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
is about two or three thank you very
 
06:13:25.080 --> 06:13:27.830 align:start position:0%
is about two or three thank you very
much

06:13:27.830 --> 06:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:29.930 --> 06:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:13:33.110 --> 06:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh Cornell Thank you for
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question we earlier heard a
 
06:13:37.368 --> 06:13:37.378 align:start position:0%
bill asking for more money for Charter
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
Schools per student and they charter
 
06:13:41.510 --> 06:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
schools are having a difficult time
 
06:13:44.390 --> 06:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
raising money paying costs and I'm just
 
06:13:46.070 --> 06:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
wondering how they would raise the money
 
06:13:49.010 --> 06:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
to pay their portion of the of the
 
06:13:49.020 --> 06:13:50.570 align:start position:0%
to pay their portion of the of the
building

06:13:50.570 --> 06:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
building
 
06:13:52.970 --> 06:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
construction if they're having a heart
 
06:13:54.590 --> 06:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
attack because I think when Charters
 
06:13:57.650 --> 06:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
were first okayed it was that they would
 
06:14:00.048 --> 06:14:00.058 align:start position:0%
they agreed to raise a certain I don't
 
06:14:01.490 --> 06:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
even know what the percent was or if it
 
06:14:03.708 --> 06:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
was ever put into law what percent but
 
06:14:05.930 --> 06:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
when we asked them I think most of them
 
06:14:07.610 --> 06:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
said that it was a very small percent
 
06:14:13.250 --> 06:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:15.590 --> 06:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
good question I would imagine that they
 
06:14:18.288 --> 06:14:18.298 align:start position:0%
would raise as they have been now we do
 
06:14:20.330 --> 06:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
have individuals here associated with
 
06:14:21.770 --> 06:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
several Charter Schools who might be
 
06:14:24.288 --> 06:14:24.298 align:start position:0%
able to give a more expansive answer but
 
06:14:26.330 --> 06:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
I would say uh continuing what they're
 
06:14:29.930 --> 06:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
doing now in terms of fundraising
 
06:14:32.810 --> 06:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you just a
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
point of information in terms of owning
 
06:14:37.430 --> 06:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh building uh Charter School proof
 
06:14:40.970 --> 06:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
Charter School in uh our area is in the
 
06:14:43.190 --> 06:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
process or they've submitted a bid and I
 
06:14:45.548 --> 06:14:45.558 align:start position:0%
understand it's the only bid to purchase
 
06:14:48.410 --> 06:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
an Old Courthouse that is owned by the
 
06:14:48.420 --> 06:14:49.310 align:start position:0%
an Old Courthouse that is owned by the
county

06:14:49.310 --> 06:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
county
 
06:14:52.128 --> 06:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
and they plan to renovate it by taking
 
06:14:55.310 --> 06:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:59.048 --> 06:14:59.058 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:15:01.010 --> 06:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:15:03.048 --> 06:15:03.058 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair and uh and and thank you
 
06:15:04.430 --> 06:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
very much representative Mooney for
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
bringing the sword
 
06:15:08.990 --> 06:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
um to to at least to your understanding
 
06:15:11.448 --> 06:15:11.458 align:start position:0%
how many um how many charter schools
 
06:15:13.670 --> 06:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
that I don't mean this in a in a
 
06:15:15.890 --> 06:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
disparaging way at all it's just the
 
06:15:15.900 --> 06:15:17.270 align:start position:0%
disparaging way at all it's just the
question

06:15:17.270 --> 06:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:15:20.270 --> 06:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
um how many uh charter schools have
 
06:15:24.830 --> 06:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
dissolved and what would happen to real
 
06:15:28.670 --> 06:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
property in in those cases
 
06:15:31.448 --> 06:15:31.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:15:34.070 --> 06:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so
 
06:15:36.590 --> 06:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
dissolved over time I don't know I mean
 
06:15:38.930 --> 06:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
I know one recently within the last year
 
06:15:41.510 --> 06:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
or so very close to Concord here if not
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
in Concord did
 
06:15:45.830 --> 06:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh but over the course of Charter
 
06:15:47.930 --> 06:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
history I do not know someone else may
 
06:15:51.170 --> 06:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
though that's number one and um with
 
06:15:54.350 --> 06:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
results with regard to dissolving that
 
06:15:56.330 --> 06:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
has to be in their Charter as I
 
06:15:58.670 --> 06:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
understand it so there's a plan for
 
06:15:58.680 --> 06:16:00.110 align:start position:0%
understand it so there's a plan for
dissolution

06:16:00.110 --> 06:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
dissolution
 
06:16:03.048 --> 06:16:03.058 align:start position:0%
in the charter application when a
 
06:16:05.090 --> 06:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
charter files with the Department of Ed
 
06:16:07.190 --> 06:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
and the Board of Education
 
06:16:09.830 --> 06:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up is is that currently spelled
 
06:16:12.048 --> 06:16:12.058 align:start position:0%
the dissolution plan are those
 
06:16:13.670 --> 06:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
parameters currently spelled out in
 
06:16:16.010 --> 06:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
statute I believe there is a bill this
 
06:16:19.490 --> 06:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
year that that that goes that
 
06:16:22.490 --> 06:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
um that is directed to uh to this but
 
06:16:24.530 --> 06:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
was wondering if is it if it's currently
 
06:16:26.750 --> 06:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
spelled out
 
06:16:29.628 --> 06:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't know the um if it's in
 
06:16:31.310 --> 06:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
law however I do believe that the
 
06:16:34.610 --> 06:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
department of Ed does give parameters
 
06:16:36.590 --> 06:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
and guidance in terms of developing a
 
06:16:39.590 --> 06:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
charter and it would the idea would be
 
06:16:40.930 --> 06:16:40.940 align:start position:0%
laid out there
 
06:16:43.970 --> 06:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
if I could too Mr chairman the
 
06:16:45.410 --> 06:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
contradiction in law I would like to
 
06:16:48.708 --> 06:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
just spell out the two rsas if I could
 
06:16:50.990 --> 06:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
for everyone to be able to get a full
 
06:16:55.430 --> 06:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of that so where it says
 
06:16:58.310 --> 06:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools do not get school
 
06:17:03.470 --> 06:17:03.480 align:start position:0%

further questions from the committee
 
06:17:44.390 --> 06:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cascade
 
06:17:46.730 --> 06:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing those two rsas
 
06:17:46.740 --> 06:17:48.470 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing those two rsas
out

06:17:48.470 --> 06:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:17:50.628 --> 06:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
and this is a question that I don't I
 
06:17:52.310 --> 06:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't know so
 
06:17:54.650 --> 06:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's not intentional that it's facetious
 
06:17:57.530 --> 06:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
but if if Charter Schools receive
 
06:18:00.110 --> 06:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
building Aid would they be responsible
 
06:18:03.048 --> 06:18:03.058 align:start position:0%
also to do all of the data reporting
 
06:18:05.390 --> 06:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
that public schools do I don't know if
 
06:18:07.868 --> 06:18:07.878 align:start position:0%
they already do them I'm talking about
 
06:18:10.250 --> 06:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
asbestos management air quality
 
06:18:14.150 --> 06:18:14.160 align:start position:0%

06:18:17.510 --> 06:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
school safety all of those requirements
 
06:18:20.868 --> 06:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
I mean I interpret them as uh
 
06:18:23.448 --> 06:18:23.458 align:start position:0%
accountability and Tran you know being
 
06:18:25.850 --> 06:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
able to account for everything that we
 
06:18:25.860 --> 06:18:26.628 align:start position:0%
able to account for everything that we
have

06:18:26.628 --> 06:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:18:29.030 --> 06:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
do you know of charter schools public
 
06:18:31.010 --> 06:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
charter schools have to complete all
 
06:18:33.708 --> 06:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
those data reports as well
 
06:18:35.150 --> 06:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question my
 
06:18:38.270 --> 06:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is as public schools yes
 
06:18:40.490 --> 06:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
they do okay
 
06:18:43.070 --> 06:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and those reports like any
 
06:18:48.170 --> 06:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:50.628 --> 06:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
have you looked at the the school
 
06:18:52.788 --> 06:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
building I'm sure you have uh the the
 
06:18:58.850 --> 06:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
law which we went through on 452 198.15
 
06:19:02.628 --> 06:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
Etc and where it identifies that funds
 
06:19:04.850 --> 06:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
received from charitable trusts bequest
 
06:19:07.490 --> 06:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
gifts insurance policies federal grants
 
06:19:10.910 --> 06:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
or grants from other state programs are
 
06:19:15.230 --> 06:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
subtracted uh from the total project
 
06:19:19.368 --> 06:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
costs uh for public
 
06:19:19.378 --> 06:19:21.470 align:start position:0%
costs uh for public
schools

06:19:21.470 --> 06:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:19:24.288 --> 06:19:24.298 align:start position:0%
in your case the the public school has
 
06:19:26.650 --> 06:19:26.660 align:start position:0%
taxing Authority through their District
 
06:19:30.170 --> 06:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
you don't have that as a charter school
 
06:19:32.208 --> 06:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
so you're going to need to be able to
 
06:19:34.128 --> 06:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
use those
 
06:19:38.750 --> 06:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
gifts charitable gifts etc etc etc uh in
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
in your your cost of your project is
 
06:19:41.990 --> 06:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
06:19:44.150 --> 06:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
or are you following my line of thinking
 
06:19:44.160 --> 06:19:44.990 align:start position:0%
or are you following my line of thinking
here

06:19:44.990 --> 06:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:19:47.868 --> 06:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
I am and to get to the Crux of that I
 
06:19:50.208 --> 06:19:50.218 align:start position:0%
have not explored that that was your
 
06:19:54.288 --> 06:19:54.298 align:start position:0%
question you explore and look at so that
 
06:19:54.298 --> 06:19:57.230 align:start position:0%
question you explore and look at so that
there

06:19:57.230 --> 06:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:58.788 --> 06:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
it's something I think we need to look
 
06:20:01.070 --> 06:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
at yep
 
06:20:03.230 --> 06:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
Point well taken but I myself in
 
06:20:05.208 --> 06:20:05.218 align:start position:0%
preparation of this bill did not take
 
06:20:07.730 --> 06:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
that angle thank you it's just reading
 
06:20:09.410 --> 06:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
the fine print all through both these
 
06:20:12.110 --> 06:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
like you know I think it was represented
 
06:20:14.030 --> 06:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
pill that's putting forth the
 
06:20:16.368 --> 06:20:16.378 align:start position:0%
codification and we're seeing that in
 
06:20:19.610 --> 06:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
numerous areas in the statutes numerous
 
06:20:21.948 --> 06:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
where one says one the other says the
 
06:20:21.958 --> 06:20:23.150 align:start position:0%
where one says one the other says the
other

06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:20:25.190 --> 06:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
further questions of Representative
 
06:20:25.200 --> 06:20:26.750 align:start position:0%
further questions of Representative
Mooney

06:20:26.750 --> 06:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
Mooney
 
06:20:30.470 --> 06:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:33.350 --> 06:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
um the next is
 
06:20:35.990 --> 06:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
Bob best uh Bob do you have to get out
 
06:20:36.000 --> 06:20:37.730 align:start position:0%
Bob best uh Bob do you have to get out
here

06:20:37.730 --> 06:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:20:40.010 --> 06:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
okay good I know we're closing in on
 
06:20:40.020 --> 06:20:49.390 align:start position:0%
okay good I know we're closing in on
that

06:20:49.390 --> 06:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:51.830 --> 06:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
06:20:53.628 --> 06:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Bob
 
06:20:56.930 --> 06:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
best I live in Merrimack New Hampshire
 
06:20:59.750 --> 06:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
um let's see I am on the board of the
 
06:21:01.788 --> 06:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
founders Academy as the chair I'm on the
 
06:21:04.430 --> 06:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
board of spark Academy as the treasurer
 
06:21:06.948 --> 06:21:06.958 align:start position:0%

Hollis

06:21:08.390 --> 06:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
Hollis
 
06:21:09.830 --> 06:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill and I hope that
 
06:21:12.288 --> 06:21:12.298 align:start position:0%
you do too it's very very important for
 
06:21:13.910 --> 06:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
charter schools to be able to access
 
06:21:16.490 --> 06:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
this kind of Aid up until now there's
 
06:21:18.948 --> 06:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
about 33 existing charter schools in New
 
06:21:20.390 --> 06:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was just counting them on
 
06:21:21.590 --> 06:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
their website I hope I didn't miss count
 
06:21:23.330 --> 06:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
and Miss anybody
 
06:21:25.490 --> 06:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
um I I think that there are very very
 
06:21:27.708 --> 06:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
few that own their own buildings but
 
06:21:30.830 --> 06:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the outfall of the
 
06:21:32.150 --> 06:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment that's always
 
06:21:34.490 --> 06:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
existed when the charter school law was
 
06:21:36.708 --> 06:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
first adopted Charter Schools couldn't
 
06:21:38.750 --> 06:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
borrow money for their first five years
 
06:21:41.868 --> 06:21:41.878 align:start position:0%
of existence and so they couldn't buy a
 
06:21:43.070 --> 06:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
building because they couldn't get a
 
06:21:46.368 --> 06:21:46.378 align:start position:0%
mortgage and so they would create a
 
06:21:48.288 --> 06:21:48.298 align:start position:0%
foundation and get private donations or
 
06:21:50.150 --> 06:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
find some leasable space on the market
 
06:21:51.890 --> 06:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
and try and work their way through that
 
06:21:54.288 --> 06:21:54.298 align:start position:0%
and that that law had been amended so
 
06:21:55.610 --> 06:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
now they can go to the bank and borrow
 
06:21:55.620 --> 06:21:56.448 align:start position:0%
now they can go to the bank and borrow
money

06:21:56.448 --> 06:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:21:58.368 --> 06:21:58.378 align:start position:0%
um and and try to acquire their own
 
06:22:00.530 --> 06:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
buildings but it's obviously very very
 
06:22:03.288 --> 06:22:03.298 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to do so so by and
 
06:22:05.288 --> 06:22:05.298 align:start position:0%
large they are
 
06:22:08.570 --> 06:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
created with the private donations and
 
06:22:10.610 --> 06:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
and sometimes least and least with very
 
06:22:12.530 --> 06:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
friendly terms from people with our
 
06:22:14.990 --> 06:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
interest in school choice
 
06:22:17.030 --> 06:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
um when we were here uh last week
 
06:22:18.350 --> 06:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:22:20.150 --> 06:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
um per pupil aid for Charter Schools I
 
06:22:21.530 --> 06:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
talked about how
 
06:22:22.910 --> 06:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
um the current rate is something like
 
06:22:25.190 --> 06:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
forty dollars per student per day and if
 
06:22:26.448 --> 06:22:26.458 align:start position:0%
that bill would have passed it would be
 
06:22:29.030 --> 06:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
50 per student per day and I think if
 
06:22:31.910 --> 06:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
you did some quick back of the napkin
 
06:22:33.470 --> 06:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
math and see what does it take to run a
 
06:22:35.030 --> 06:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
school you'd see there's very little
 
06:22:37.310 --> 06:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
left when you pay teachers and books and
 
06:22:39.830 --> 06:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
lights and computers and all of that for
 
06:22:41.570 --> 06:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
the building itself and that's why they
 
06:22:43.448 --> 06:22:43.458 align:start position:0%
relied so heavily on private donations
 
06:22:46.670 --> 06:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
and you know uh what a blessing it is
 
06:22:48.350 --> 06:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
for us to have the food the kind of
 
06:22:49.490 --> 06:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
people that are there to support those
 
06:22:50.868 --> 06:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
kinds of schools and make those kinds of
 
06:22:52.490 --> 06:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
donations but at the end of the day
 
06:22:54.230 --> 06:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
charter school students are public
 
06:22:55.788 --> 06:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
school students just like any other
 
06:22:59.208 --> 06:22:59.218 align:start position:0%
public school students and we should as
 
06:23:01.730 --> 06:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
a state Embrace and and take care of our
 
06:23:03.948 --> 06:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
Public Schools I know there's been a lot
 
06:23:05.750 --> 06:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
of discussion about the ownership of the
 
06:23:07.070 --> 06:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
buildings and what happens to them if
 
06:23:08.750 --> 06:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
the schools fail
 
06:23:10.850 --> 06:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
um it's charter schools are are the only
 
06:23:13.368 --> 06:23:13.378 align:start position:0%
public schools that are sort of really
 
06:23:15.530 --> 06:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
subject to that existential threat of
 
06:23:17.810 --> 06:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
failing being it's because of the you
 
06:23:20.030 --> 06:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
know the prep people Aid at 40 or 50 per
 
06:23:20.040 --> 06:23:21.110 align:start position:0%
know the prep people Aid at 40 or 50 per
student

06:23:21.110 --> 06:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
student
 
06:23:24.410 --> 06:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
um if you uh uh have anything that comes
 
06:23:26.330 --> 06:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh along the line in the course of a
 
06:23:28.548 --> 06:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
year that's unexpected run toward it
 
06:23:29.810 --> 06:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
could really tip over a charter school
 
06:23:31.548 --> 06:23:31.558 align:start position:0%
and do it pretty easily whereas the
 
06:23:33.110 --> 06:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
regular public school has other means to
 
06:23:34.910 --> 06:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
manage that situation
 
06:23:36.530 --> 06:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
um and so Charter's Public Schools can
 
06:23:38.690 --> 06:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
fail they haven't terribly frequently
 
06:23:40.548 --> 06:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
but it has happened
 
06:23:43.310 --> 06:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
um but having building Aid would take
 
06:23:45.410 --> 06:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest threats away and
 
06:23:46.788 --> 06:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
that's the cost of the building that
 
06:23:50.628 --> 06:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
they they have to uh incurate today and
 
06:23:53.750 --> 06:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
so it may help in that regard and this
 
06:23:55.670 --> 06:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill does deal with the notion of what
 
06:23:57.430 --> 06:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
happens to the property if they do fail
 
06:23:59.690 --> 06:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
separate from that separate from the
 
06:24:01.250 --> 06:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
entire department of education and all
 
06:24:04.070 --> 06:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
the education laws these charter schools
 
06:24:05.868 --> 06:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
are all formed as non-profit
 
06:24:07.430 --> 06:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
corporations in New Hampshire and every
 
06:24:10.910 --> 06:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
non-profit Corporation in its Charter in
 
06:24:13.128 --> 06:24:13.138 align:start position:0%
its articles of organization spell out
 
06:24:15.410 --> 06:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
what happens to their assets that has
 
06:24:16.610 --> 06:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with being a school or
 
06:24:17.930 --> 06:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
anything else it's just being a charity
 
06:24:19.430 --> 06:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you spell out what you
 
06:24:21.470 --> 06:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
do with your assets and typically the
 
06:24:23.208 --> 06:24:23.218 align:start position:0%
response is that they're contributed to
 
06:24:26.208 --> 06:24:26.218 align:start position:0%
as a an organization with a similar
 
06:24:28.548 --> 06:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
errors like a mission as possible now
 
06:24:31.010 --> 06:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
this would be adapted a little bit based
 
06:24:32.208 --> 06:24:32.218 align:start position:0%
on guidance from the Department of
 
06:24:34.090 --> 06:24:34.100 align:start position:0%
Education under this bill
 
06:24:38.448 --> 06:24:38.458 align:start position:0%
so I tried to quickly cover a few of the
 
06:24:39.530 --> 06:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
questions that I've heard come up but
 
06:24:42.410 --> 06:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
really I just want to express the strong
 
06:24:44.090 --> 06:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
support for the bill it's very very
 
06:24:46.490 --> 06:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
important for the continued existence of
 
06:24:48.670 --> 06:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools and for school choice
 
06:24:50.930 --> 06:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
that they have access to this building
 
06:24:53.990 --> 06:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
Aid because the building is
 
06:24:56.690 --> 06:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
um aside from the the staff and teachers
 
06:24:59.270 --> 06:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
the most expensive element of trying to
 
06:25:01.850 --> 06:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
deliver charter school for some Founders
 
06:25:03.948 --> 06:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
Academy's building is is well over five
 
06:25:06.350 --> 06:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars and that's not
 
06:25:06.360 --> 06:25:07.910 align:start position:0%
million dollars and that's not
particularly

06:25:07.910 --> 06:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
06:25:10.670 --> 06:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
art school so these are Big expenses
 
06:25:12.530 --> 06:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
that have come from
 
06:25:16.250 --> 06:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
kind-hearted people but these are public
 
06:25:18.350 --> 06:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
school students and public schools so
 
06:25:20.510 --> 06:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's all that I have and I got in a
 
06:25:22.610 --> 06:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
minute or two if you had a question but
 
06:25:23.930 --> 06:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't we got three or four
 
06:25:26.208 --> 06:25:26.218 align:start position:0%
minutes here folks any questions from
 
06:25:26.218 --> 06:25:28.250 align:start position:0%
minutes here folks any questions from
representative

06:25:28.250 --> 06:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:25:30.288 --> 06:25:30.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:25:33.048 --> 06:25:33.058 align:start position:0%
being here so one of the questions that
 
06:25:35.868 --> 06:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
we dealt with earlier was the issue of
 
06:25:38.628 --> 06:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
viability of a charter school to raise
 
06:25:41.448 --> 06:25:41.458 align:start position:0%
money to to purchase a building so could
 
06:25:43.730 --> 06:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
you uh tell us uh tell the committee
 
06:25:47.208 --> 06:25:47.218 align:start position:0%
please how what is the percent of your
 
06:25:49.208 --> 06:25:49.218 align:start position:0%
current budget in
 
06:25:53.090 --> 06:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
the founders Academy and Sparks that you
 
06:25:56.330 --> 06:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
do raise through fundraising so uh for
 
06:25:58.070 --> 06:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
both schools it's very small it's a few
 
06:25:59.628 --> 06:25:59.638 align:start position:0%
percentage points I'm not sure exactly
 
06:26:01.548 --> 06:26:01.558 align:start position:0%
what it is but I if it was five percent
 
06:26:03.650 --> 06:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
I'd be surprised it's probably one or
 
06:26:06.230 --> 06:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
two or something like that now when they
 
06:26:08.628 --> 06:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
raise money for the building that occurs
 
06:26:10.430 --> 06:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
in the planning phase and sometimes
 
06:26:12.890 --> 06:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
before the charter application is even
 
06:26:15.530 --> 06:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
submitted somebody has an idea of how
 
06:26:16.670 --> 06:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to solve the problem of
 
06:26:19.430 --> 06:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
getting a building and um and you do
 
06:26:21.230 --> 06:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
that through who you recruit to be
 
06:26:22.788 --> 06:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
involved in the effort and what you
 
06:26:24.890 --> 06:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
think might be available in the universe
 
06:26:28.788 --> 06:26:28.798 align:start position:0%
but that's a one-time effort uh in the
 
06:26:30.288 --> 06:26:30.298 align:start position:0%
in the Journey of a charter school and
 
06:26:32.628 --> 06:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
like Founders Academy is now nine years
 
06:26:33.830 --> 06:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
old or something eight years old or
 
06:26:36.288 --> 06:26:36.298 align:start position:0%
something so that was I wasn't part of
 
06:26:38.030 --> 06:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
the original formation of the founders
 
06:26:40.250 --> 06:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
Academy what went into that further
 
06:26:40.260 --> 06:26:41.868 align:start position:0%
Academy what went into that further
questions

06:26:41.868 --> 06:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:26:43.788 --> 06:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you thank you
 
06:26:45.830 --> 06:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
for letting me um uh be the first one up
 
06:26:48.350 --> 06:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
and get out of here you're welcome
 
06:26:57.948 --> 06:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:01.990 --> 06:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:05.510 --> 06:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon it's good afternoon thank
 
06:27:07.490 --> 06:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
you for being here and listening giving
 
06:27:09.590 --> 06:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
me a chance to speak my name is Kimberly
 
06:27:12.770 --> 06:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
Lavallee I'm from Mount Vernon and I
 
06:27:14.270 --> 06:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
currently sit on three Charter School
 
06:27:16.670 --> 06:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
boards and two foundations that were
 
06:27:19.970 --> 06:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
created over the last I must say 12
 
06:27:21.948 --> 06:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
years at different periods to support
 
06:27:23.390 --> 06:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools through a lot of
 
06:27:25.310 --> 06:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer efforts
 
06:27:28.010 --> 06:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
if I can I I am in support of this bill
 
06:27:31.190 --> 06:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
but I would like to try to answer a few
 
06:27:32.868 --> 06:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
of the questions kind of going around
 
06:27:34.548 --> 06:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
the room if I remember them in order
 
06:27:38.510 --> 06:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
regarding reports we don't file every
 
06:27:41.570 --> 06:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
single report that traditional Public
 
06:27:44.810 --> 06:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
Schools do but we file most of them so
 
06:27:46.490 --> 06:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
all the ones that you listed I believe
 
06:27:48.590 --> 06:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
we file I went through I was trying to
 
06:27:50.570 --> 06:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
remember back in the day so those are
 
06:27:52.490 --> 06:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
done yes
 
06:27:54.650 --> 06:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
um there's been questions about how will
 
06:27:57.650 --> 06:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
charter schools be sustainable and able
 
06:27:59.510 --> 06:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
to raise money their share of it towards
 
06:28:01.368 --> 06:28:01.378 align:start position:0%
these repairs if they qualify for
 
06:28:03.708 --> 06:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
building Aid we currently have to find
 
06:28:05.448 --> 06:28:05.458 align:start position:0%
that money because we have to make these
 
06:28:08.628 --> 06:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
repairs I spent a summer looking for
 
06:28:10.368 --> 06:28:10.378 align:start position:0%
loans to put a six hundred and seven
 
06:28:12.230 --> 06:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar refund we're not looking
 
06:28:14.510 --> 06:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
for millions and tens of millions and
 
06:28:16.970 --> 06:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions charter schools are
 
06:28:19.970 --> 06:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
typically smaller facilities and I've
 
06:28:22.548 --> 06:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
been involved in the renovation of one
 
06:28:24.288 --> 06:28:24.298 align:start position:0%
which was a five and a half million
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
dollar project we were very fortunate to
 
06:28:29.868 --> 06:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
have a benefactor on that way back when
 
06:28:31.970 --> 06:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
um but maintaining that building we have
 
06:28:33.948 --> 06:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
to fundraise we have to find the funds
 
06:28:36.770 --> 06:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
we furnished it with or I'm sorry I
 
06:28:38.868 --> 06:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
expanded it with another I think it was
 
06:28:41.270 --> 06:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
8 000 square feet we had to raise the
 
06:28:44.270 --> 06:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
money for that we had to find it took
 
06:28:47.150 --> 06:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
out a small loan for it as well the roof
 
06:28:51.610 --> 06:28:51.620 align:start position:0%
another 607 000 two loans plus donations
 
06:28:55.010 --> 06:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
so we have to find it anyway regardless
 
06:28:57.948 --> 06:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
the questions are asked but the repairs
 
06:28:59.930 --> 06:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
need to be done if water is pouring in
 
06:29:01.610 --> 06:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
your ceiling you have to find the money
 
06:29:03.310 --> 06:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
to fix the problem
 
06:29:05.390 --> 06:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
they've been doing it and they'll
 
06:29:07.250 --> 06:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
continue doing it building Aid would
 
06:29:09.470 --> 06:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
make a huge difference
 
06:29:11.510 --> 06:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
let me just check here
 
06:29:13.670 --> 06:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
um there was conversation about the
 
06:29:16.628 --> 06:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
dissolution statements I looked one up
 
06:29:19.970 --> 06:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
just an example and this is an old one
 
06:29:21.470 --> 06:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
but I'll just give you some general
 
06:29:23.750 --> 06:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
language I know the department of Ed has
 
06:29:25.670 --> 06:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
definitely beefed up their requests on
 
06:29:29.690 --> 06:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
these but this one has language that
 
06:29:32.990 --> 06:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
starts with should the school seize
 
06:29:35.390 --> 06:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
operation or have its Charter revoked by
 
06:29:37.910 --> 06:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
its authorizer the board shall consult
 
06:29:40.070 --> 06:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
with an attorney in the Department of
 
06:29:40.080 --> 06:29:41.570 align:start position:0%
with an attorney in the Department of
Education

06:29:41.570 --> 06:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
Education
 
06:29:44.390 --> 06:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
to assure that contractual and financial
 
06:29:47.390 --> 06:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
obligations are met so these are schools
 
06:29:47.400 --> 06:29:49.430 align:start position:0%
obligations are met so these are schools
that

06:29:49.430 --> 06:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:53.690 --> 06:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
are approved by the state we have to
 
06:29:56.030 --> 06:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
figure out what we owe and pay it back
 
06:29:58.190 --> 06:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
so the statements today the solution
 
06:30:00.110 --> 06:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
statements today that are in the
 
06:30:03.110 --> 06:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
charters are much more comprehensive and
 
06:30:06.230 --> 06:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
focused on how those funds or how those
 
06:30:08.868 --> 06:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
assets will be dissolved and where those
 
06:30:11.150 --> 06:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
funds will go I think that's something
 
06:30:13.010 --> 06:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
that this board could have a
 
06:30:16.610 --> 06:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
conversation about or this committee
 
06:30:21.230 --> 06:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:23.628 --> 06:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
and that's what I've had that's what I
 
06:30:25.190 --> 06:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
had for notes to try and answer anything
 
06:30:26.930 --> 06:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
that was outstanding are there any
 
06:30:26.940 --> 06:30:27.948 align:start position:0%
that was outstanding are there any
questions

06:30:27.948 --> 06:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:30:31.250 --> 06:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
06:30:33.230 --> 06:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
I've got one for you
 
06:30:35.270 --> 06:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
um so we've heard that there's two
 
06:30:37.430 --> 06:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
possibly three charter schools which are
 
06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
are owned uh not not through rental or
 
06:30:43.610 --> 06:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
some but they're owned uh are those
 
06:30:46.250 --> 06:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
buildings when they're looked at by the
 
06:30:49.548 --> 06:30:49.558 align:start position:0%
department of education do they meet all
 
06:30:51.410 --> 06:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
the the standards that we would have
 
06:30:53.990 --> 06:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
within our building aid program right
 
06:30:57.410 --> 06:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
now do they you know idea stuff uh do
 
06:30:59.390 --> 06:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
they have you know the square footage is
 
06:31:01.448 --> 06:31:01.458 align:start position:0%
necessary for the classrooms
 
06:31:03.948 --> 06:31:03.958 align:start position:0%
there's so many different standards
 
06:31:06.288 --> 06:31:06.298 align:start position:0%
engineering required standards fire
 
06:31:10.250 --> 06:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
codes building codes all that do I can
 
06:31:10.260 --> 06:31:11.110 align:start position:0%
codes building codes all that do I can
answer

06:31:11.110 --> 06:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
answer
 
06:31:14.150 --> 06:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
to Fire and Building Codes because I've
 
06:31:15.830 --> 06:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
been through those inspections and in
 
06:31:17.448 --> 06:31:17.458 align:start position:0%
the planning process with several
 
06:31:20.390 --> 06:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
schools that were renovated I don't
 
06:31:22.368 --> 06:31:22.378 align:start position:0%
believe and Amy may be better able to
 
06:31:24.650 --> 06:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
answer this I don't believe we are
 
06:31:26.570 --> 06:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
subject to the square footage
 
06:31:26.580 --> 06:31:31.010 align:start position:0%
subject to the square footage
requirement

06:31:31.010 --> 06:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:33.530 --> 06:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
we're not required to adhere to the
 
06:31:36.048 --> 06:31:36.058 align:start position:0%
square footage per pupil Etc
 
06:31:37.788 --> 06:31:37.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:31:39.650 --> 06:31:39.660 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
 
06:31:44.048 --> 06:31:44.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:56.770 --> 06:31:56.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:00.288 --> 06:32:00.298 align:start position:0%
hello uh Eric power uh president of sdg
 
06:32:02.810 --> 06:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
I live in Brookline and our organization
 
06:32:05.090 --> 06:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
supports this bill
 
06:32:05.100 --> 06:32:05.690 align:start position:0%
supports this bill
um

06:32:05.690 --> 06:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:07.310 --> 06:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:32:10.010 --> 06:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
I in our recent uh in the recent ranking
 
06:32:11.930 --> 06:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
we came in the bottom four places I
 
06:32:14.150 --> 06:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned in a previous bill but I think
 
06:32:17.510 --> 06:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know this makes sense to allow uh
 
06:32:19.548 --> 06:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
Charters public charter schools to be
 
06:32:21.890 --> 06:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
eligible for the aid
 
06:32:37.490 --> 06:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:39.830 --> 06:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that they're not eligible for
 
06:32:41.510 --> 06:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
building Aid is probably the reason why
 
06:32:43.910 --> 06:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
there's only two to three charter
 
06:32:45.590 --> 06:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
schools that actually have their own
 
06:32:47.270 --> 06:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
building so the building Aid may be an
 
06:32:49.430 --> 06:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
enabler for them
 
06:32:51.530 --> 06:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
um I would I think you need to look at
 
06:32:54.650 --> 06:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
this bill and and along with uh House
 
06:32:57.048 --> 06:32:57.058 align:start position:0%
Bill 452 the previous Bill to take a
 
06:32:59.868 --> 06:32:59.878 align:start position:0%
look at one is proposing sort of the
 
06:32:59.878 --> 06:33:01.128 align:start position:0%
look at one is proposing sort of the
20-year

06:33:01.128 --> 06:33:01.138 align:start position:0%
20-year
 
06:33:02.930 --> 06:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
approach and the other one's doing the
 
06:33:05.930 --> 06:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
80 20 80 percent start 20 so I think you
 
06:33:08.448 --> 06:33:08.458 align:start position:0%
want to align those if you're feeling to
 
06:33:09.590 --> 06:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
support both of these bills with
 
06:33:09.600 --> 06:33:10.970 align:start position:0%
support both of these bills with
Amendment

06:33:10.970 --> 06:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:33:12.170 --> 06:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
um and also I think it was mentioned
 
06:33:15.170 --> 06:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
about the charitable trust gifts being
 
06:33:16.850 --> 06:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
deducted from state aid I think that
 
06:33:18.590 --> 06:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
would not be a that would not work at
 
06:33:20.090 --> 06:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
all for a charter school I think you
 
06:33:22.128 --> 06:33:22.138 align:start position:0%
caught that one so I think that's on the
 
06:33:24.530 --> 06:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
list for an amendment but I think just
 
06:33:26.208 --> 06:33:26.218 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say is it's really a
 
06:33:28.190 --> 06:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
matter of fairness that public school
 
06:33:30.590 --> 06:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
public charter schools be eligible for
 
06:33:34.310 --> 06:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
public aid they serve the students that
 
06:33:37.368 --> 06:33:37.378 align:start position:0%
go there they are public schools and
 
06:33:40.250 --> 06:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
they should be supported so I recommend
 
06:33:44.570 --> 06:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 354. thank
 
06:33:46.730 --> 06:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there questions from
 
06:33:48.530 --> 06:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
06:33:52.190 --> 06:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much thank you
 
06:33:53.868 --> 06:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
is there anybody in the committee that's
 
06:33:55.610 --> 06:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
looking for technical support from the
 
06:33:59.030 --> 06:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
Department we have from Amy Clark a card
 
06:33:59.040 --> 06:34:00.530 align:start position:0%
Department we have from Amy Clark a card
here

06:34:00.530 --> 06:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:34:04.090 --> 06:34:04.100 align:start position:0%
if if we need it on this bill
 
06:34:07.788 --> 06:34:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:10.730 --> 06:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
so with that we don't have any other
 
06:34:13.310 --> 06:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
cards on this so we'll close the hearing
 
06:34:16.810 --> 06:34:16.820 align:start position:0%
for uh 354.
 
06:34:21.110 --> 06:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
and delve into the next one
 
06:34:22.910 --> 06:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
does anybody have to take a five minute
 
06:34:22.920 --> 06:34:24.230 align:start position:0%
does anybody have to take a five minute
break

06:34:24.230 --> 06:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
break
 
06:34:27.470 --> 06:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
I I hear oh yeah okay we will take a

06:49:24.288 --> 06:49:24.298 align:start position:0%
9 10 11 so co-sponsors and a couple
 
06:49:27.530 --> 06:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
Senators on here that actually is uh
 
06:49:31.250 --> 06:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
liking this how it is this is adding
 
06:49:31.260 --> 06:49:32.448 align:start position:0%
liking this how it is this is adding
um

06:49:32.448 --> 06:49:32.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:34.670 --> 06:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
just trying to basically play nice all
 
06:49:37.090 --> 06:49:37.100 align:start position:0%
right in a Cooperative district
 
06:49:40.070 --> 06:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
and again it's it's adding language in
 
06:49:42.170 --> 06:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
here basically saying
 
06:49:44.570 --> 06:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
if you have a co-op that they just want
 
06:49:47.150 --> 06:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're being
 
06:49:47.160 --> 06:49:47.750 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're being
um

06:49:47.750 --> 06:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:50.628 --> 06:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
equal and and basically access so you
 
06:49:52.070 --> 06:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
have a co-op you might have one town
 
06:49:53.570 --> 06:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
with three reps of another town with
 
06:49:55.730 --> 06:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
four reps and so what happens that one
 
06:49:58.610 --> 06:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
time with four reps technically wins and
 
06:50:00.170 --> 06:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
they what happens they have all their
 
06:50:01.968 --> 06:50:01.978 align:start position:0%
meetings in the same town
 
06:50:04.548 --> 06:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
all right and since they win they always
 
06:50:06.890 --> 06:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
have the same chair all right every year
 
06:50:09.048 --> 06:50:09.058 align:start position:0%
after year and uh the person behind me
 
06:50:11.810 --> 06:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
Eric will be able to explain uh what's
 
06:50:14.030 --> 06:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
going on in the last I think nine ten
 
06:50:15.948 --> 06:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
eleven years in his case
 
06:50:18.170 --> 06:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
but so what happens is they never get a
 
06:50:20.810 --> 06:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
chance to go from one town to the next
 
06:50:23.150 --> 06:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
and so all the people that are in one
 
06:50:24.770 --> 06:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
town always have to travel through the
 
06:50:26.270 --> 06:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
other town to actually go to their
 
06:50:29.628 --> 06:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
meetings and also the what happens is
 
06:50:32.868 --> 06:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
the other Town that's in the co-op never
 
06:50:34.730 --> 06:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
gets a chance to have a chair because
 
06:50:37.610 --> 06:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
it's always one town in one case has
 
06:50:39.650 --> 06:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
four reps and and when one has three and
 
06:50:42.530 --> 06:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
the one with four always wins so even if
 
06:50:43.670 --> 06:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
they get you know if they're on the
 
06:50:45.410 --> 06:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
seven members
 
06:50:47.330 --> 06:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
they always lose the chair they never
 
06:50:49.730 --> 06:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
get a chance to have a chair and at that
 
06:50:49.740 --> 06:50:50.448 align:start position:0%
get a chance to have a chair and at that
point

06:50:50.448 --> 06:50:50.458 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:50:52.128 --> 06:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
um they never get a chance to actually
 
06:50:54.110 --> 06:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
rotate the meetings so that's what all
 
06:50:57.530 --> 06:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:59.750 --> 06:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
06:51:02.750 --> 06:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:04.730 --> 06:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
you off the hook
 
06:51:07.430 --> 06:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:51:19.850 --> 06:51:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:19.860 --> 06:51:26.288 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:51:26.288 --> 06:51:26.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:29.930 --> 06:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
president of sdga New Hampshire
 
06:51:29.940 --> 06:51:30.650 align:start position:0%
president of sdga New Hampshire
um

06:51:30.650 --> 06:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:33.650 --> 06:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to make a
 
06:51:35.150 --> 06:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District a little
 
06:51:37.190 --> 06:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
more Cooperative
 
06:51:39.410 --> 06:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
um I know that sounds ironic and funny
 
06:51:41.830 --> 06:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
06:51:44.510 --> 06:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's a net it's human nature that you're
 
06:51:47.448 --> 06:51:47.458 align:start position:0%
going to if you have a two-town co-op
 
06:51:50.030 --> 06:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
for example I'll use Hollis Brookline
 
06:51:52.670 --> 06:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
that currently has used to have five
 
06:51:55.010 --> 06:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
members from Halls two from Brookline it
 
06:51:57.170 --> 06:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
got switched over a number of years ago
 
06:51:59.208 --> 06:51:59.218 align:start position:0%
to four and three four from Hollis three
 
06:52:01.128 --> 06:52:01.138 align:start position:0%
from Brookline and I served on that
 
06:52:04.250 --> 06:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
board and each year I attempted to be
 
06:52:05.288 --> 06:52:05.298 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
06:52:10.850 --> 06:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
and uh this is back 2014 2015 2016 time
 
06:52:13.850 --> 06:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
frame and it was always somebody from
 
06:52:15.590 --> 06:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
Hollis that was picked because the
 
06:52:17.390 --> 06:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hollis people all voted for the Hollis
 
06:52:19.190 --> 06:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
individual and the proclaimed people
 
06:52:20.530 --> 06:52:20.540 align:start position:0%
voted for me
 
06:52:23.690 --> 06:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
and um and it wasn't the same person it
 
06:52:25.610 --> 06:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
was a different person each time
 
06:52:28.850 --> 06:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
and if I go back for
 
06:52:31.868 --> 06:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
um you know since that time since 2013
 
06:52:34.548 --> 06:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
all those years I think it's 11 or 12
 
06:52:36.170 --> 06:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
years we've actually had the
 
06:52:38.510 --> 06:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
chairmanship from a Brookline rep one
 
06:52:40.730 --> 06:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
one year the rest of the year as it was
 
06:52:42.350 --> 06:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
it's been Hollis and it continues to be
 
06:52:45.410 --> 06:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
Hollis for example so
 
06:52:45.420 --> 06:52:46.190 align:start position:0%
Hollis for example so
um

06:52:46.190 --> 06:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:52:49.548 --> 06:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
the chair actually sets the agenda
 
06:52:51.708 --> 06:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
controls you know a lot of the meeting I
 
06:52:53.270 --> 06:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
mean there was there are other members
 
06:52:55.788 --> 06:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
there but it sets the tone so it makes
 
06:52:58.610 --> 06:52:58.620 align:start position:0%
sense in a two-time co-op and even in a
 
06:53:01.430 --> 06:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
multi-town co-op to be able to uh rotate
 
06:53:04.310 --> 06:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
that chair among the towns the other
 
06:53:06.170 --> 06:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
thing that would that's nice is you're
 
06:53:08.570 --> 06:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
also got to consider the public and if
 
06:53:10.670 --> 06:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
you have a co-op and you're rotating the
 
06:53:12.468 --> 06:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
location between your two towns three
 
06:53:14.150 --> 06:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
towns however many have it gives an
 
06:53:16.968 --> 06:53:16.978 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a shorter commute for
 
06:53:18.590 --> 06:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
those board members from those towns but
 
06:53:20.030 --> 06:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
it also enables the public to
 
06:53:22.670 --> 06:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
participate a little bit easier
 
06:53:24.288 --> 06:53:24.298 align:start position:0%
um obviously they have students going
 
06:53:25.968 --> 06:53:25.978 align:start position:0%
from all those towns so it does it makes
 
06:53:28.070 --> 06:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
sense for the school board to rotate
 
06:53:30.770 --> 06:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
among the member towns so that's really
 
06:53:34.968 --> 06:53:34.978 align:start position:0%
the idea here is to you know share the
 
06:53:37.128 --> 06:53:37.138 align:start position:0%
leadership among the towns in different
 
06:53:39.530 --> 06:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
years to give the towns the the
 
06:53:42.590 --> 06:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate and you know
 
06:53:43.968 --> 06:53:43.978 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in here that if
 
06:53:46.368 --> 06:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
somebody in a town doesn't want to do it
 
06:53:47.810 --> 06:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
they can continue they can do
 
06:53:49.490 --> 06:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
consecutive years from the same town if
 
06:53:50.930 --> 06:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
there's no willing board members to
 
06:53:52.968 --> 06:53:52.978 align:start position:0%
serve as the chair
 
06:53:54.350 --> 06:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
um same thing with the meeting if it's
 
06:53:56.868 --> 06:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
not practical for is not a municipal or
 
06:54:00.350 --> 06:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
school facility it's not required and if
 
06:54:03.590 --> 06:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
the all board members want to vote to
 
06:54:05.208 --> 06:54:05.218 align:start position:0%
not rotate the meeting that would be
 
06:54:06.650 --> 06:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote by the board then they
 
06:54:07.788 --> 06:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do that for that year
 
06:54:10.910 --> 06:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
so it it provides some level of
 
06:54:12.890 --> 06:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
cooperation in school districts but it
 
06:54:15.410 --> 06:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
provides some exceptions as well
 
06:54:17.448 --> 06:54:17.458 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take any questions thank
 
06:54:18.948 --> 06:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from the
 
06:54:22.610 --> 06:54:22.620 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent Balboni
 
06:54:24.708 --> 06:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
um again coming from a four Town
 
06:54:26.868 --> 06:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
District I'm just wondering
 
06:54:30.350 --> 06:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
um have you we've always rotated have
 
06:54:33.048 --> 06:54:33.058 align:start position:0%
you asked I mean why is there a problem
 
06:54:35.990 --> 06:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
with just requesting to move your
 
06:54:36.000 --> 06:54:37.190 align:start position:0%
with just requesting to move your
location

06:54:37.190 --> 06:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
location
 
06:54:39.590 --> 06:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
they don't want to do that they they're
 
06:54:41.810 --> 06:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
insistent on just having it in the one
 
06:54:43.250 --> 06:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
town they say that's that's their
 
06:54:45.590 --> 06:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
convenience and there's four from Hollis
 
06:54:47.330 --> 06:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
and three from Brookline and when that
 
06:54:50.390 --> 06:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
vote comes up it's downtown lines so
 
06:54:52.610 --> 06:54:52.620 align:start position:0%
that's the way it goes
 
06:54:54.650 --> 06:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
but if this was if this was here then
 
06:54:57.650 --> 06:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
that would happen it's a good practice
 
06:54:59.270 --> 06:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
it would be a good thing and maybe some
 
06:55:02.270 --> 06:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
districts do it but it it I think that's
 
06:55:04.070 --> 06:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make it so that it
 
06:55:06.708 --> 06:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
happens in co-ops co-ops are very
 
06:55:08.510 --> 06:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to get out of so you're kind
 
06:55:10.010 --> 06:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
of stuck in them and I know you guys
 
06:55:11.448 --> 06:55:11.458 align:start position:0%
have talked about co-ops and I've talked
 
06:55:14.150 --> 06:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
to co-ops with you as well so this is
 
06:55:16.490 --> 06:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
you know we're getting out of a co-op is
 
06:55:18.288 --> 06:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
not easy but this at some level of
 
06:55:20.150 --> 06:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
cooperation I think
 
06:55:22.430 --> 06:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
for the question represent cascadden did
 
06:55:25.010 --> 06:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up too yes please
 
06:55:27.948 --> 06:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
um it was very similar to that but have
 
06:55:29.270 --> 06:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
there been any attempts like say
 
06:55:31.190 --> 06:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
whatever town has the least amount of
 
06:55:33.410 --> 06:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
people have they like gone out to the
 
06:55:37.430 --> 06:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
public to try to get the public to
 
06:55:39.830 --> 06:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
kind of get this board this Cooperative
 
06:55:44.030 --> 06:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
board to look at their policy on this
 
06:55:46.368 --> 06:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff I mean it's pretty similar
 
06:55:48.048 --> 06:55:48.058 align:start position:0%
to what she just asked again you could
 
06:55:50.150 --> 06:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
do you could take it to that level
 
06:55:52.430 --> 06:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
um but you know even a petition worn
 
06:55:54.230 --> 06:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
article at an annual meeting is still
 
06:55:56.090 --> 06:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
would be advisory it's no enabling
 
06:55:58.548 --> 06:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
legislation for that and
 
06:56:00.350 --> 06:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
our school board has had a history of
 
06:56:02.628 --> 06:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
ignoring petition Warren articles that
 
06:56:04.610 --> 06:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
have passed they just said well okay
 
06:56:07.070 --> 06:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing what we want so yeah that's
 
06:56:08.990 --> 06:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
possible but it's it's is the limit
 
06:56:11.270 --> 06:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
worth the squeeze I guess for that sort
 
06:56:12.530 --> 06:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
of thing there's other bigger things we
 
06:56:15.110 --> 06:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
deal with but just to say that you know
 
06:56:17.150 --> 06:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
think about a co-op and think about if
 
06:56:18.530 --> 06:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
you're the smaller town and you never
 
06:56:20.390 --> 06:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
have leadership that's that's where you
 
06:56:22.788 --> 06:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
want to put your put your your your feet
 
06:56:24.288 --> 06:56:24.298 align:start position:0%
in those shoes and think about it that
 
06:56:24.298 --> 06:56:25.610 align:start position:0%
in those shoes and think about it that
way

06:56:25.610 --> 06:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:56:28.368 --> 06:56:28.378 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:56:30.948 --> 06:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hall thank you Mr
 
06:56:32.330 --> 06:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:56:37.310 --> 06:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
my references the um rotation rotation
 
06:56:39.650 --> 06:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
of meetings are we talking meeting to
 
06:56:43.610 --> 06:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
meeting or year to year or month or
 
06:56:45.830 --> 06:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
so yes I can answer that question so it
 
06:56:47.570 --> 06:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
says regular announce meeting so that
 
06:56:49.070 --> 06:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:56:50.570 --> 06:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
um typically most school boards meet
 
06:56:52.128 --> 06:56:52.138 align:start position:0%
monthly some will meet a little more
 
06:56:54.890 --> 06:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
frequently it's it's left ambiguous but
 
06:56:56.570 --> 06:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's saying it should rotate to some
 
06:56:58.070 --> 06:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
degree so if you're always having in the
 
06:56:59.090 --> 06:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
same time you're not going to be
 
06:57:01.910 --> 06:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
following this law if it was passed so
 
06:57:04.010 --> 06:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
you agree there is ambiguity and there
 
06:57:05.990 --> 06:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
is but it's trying to be flexible for
 
06:57:07.430 --> 06:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
that perspective but it does you can't
 
06:57:10.430 --> 06:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
just have all your meetings in one town
 
06:57:14.270 --> 06:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for a discussion
 
06:57:16.250 --> 06:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
06:57:17.990 --> 06:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:57:19.968 --> 06:57:19.978 align:start position:0%
how many Cooperative school districts
 
06:57:22.490 --> 06:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
are there in New Hampshire
 
06:57:25.610 --> 06:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
I thought Mark was fine I think there is
 
06:57:30.170 --> 06:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
33 yeah three dozen 32. okay I know it's
 
06:57:33.170 --> 06:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
in the third low 30s yeah how many
 
06:57:33.180 --> 06:57:36.490 align:start position:0%
in the third low 30s yeah how many
districts

06:57:36.490 --> 06:57:36.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:40.070 --> 06:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh a lot right I mean
 
06:57:42.708 --> 06:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a lot of two-town co-ops
 
06:57:45.110 --> 06:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
there's a number of three-town co-ops I
 
06:57:46.788 --> 06:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
06:57:48.890 --> 06:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
that was my next question was the number
 
06:57:51.468 --> 06:57:51.478 align:start position:0%
of towns in them
 
06:57:55.850 --> 06:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking for example of Kearsarge
 
06:57:58.128 --> 06:57:58.138 align:start position:0%
Five Towns right
 
06:57:59.750 --> 06:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
seven sorry
 
06:58:01.250 --> 06:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
five in my Regional School District
 
06:58:02.868 --> 06:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
growing up
 
06:58:06.530 --> 06:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
um that's a lot of rotating to
 
06:58:09.650 --> 06:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
communities that in some cases are
 
06:58:11.990 --> 06:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
considerably less access than the
 
06:58:15.170 --> 06:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
central location just an observation
 
06:58:17.690 --> 06:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
yeah it's that's why the law says when
 
06:58:19.310 --> 06:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
ex if there's a school or Municipal
 
06:58:21.288 --> 06:58:21.298 align:start position:0%
facility available it should be rotated
 
06:58:23.810 --> 06:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
those little towns deserve to have their
 
06:58:25.968 --> 06:58:25.978 align:start position:0%
board members meet there periodically if
 
06:58:27.350 --> 06:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's that many it might be once or
 
06:58:30.070 --> 06:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:32.750 --> 06:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
good question for you is it would it be
 
06:58:35.150 --> 06:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
easier for John Q public though to know
 
06:58:36.830 --> 06:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
exactly where the meeting was going to
 
06:58:40.670 --> 06:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
be held uh every two weeks or every
 
06:58:42.650 --> 06:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
month that it's done rather than having
 
06:58:44.930 --> 06:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
to try and figure am I in town eight
 
06:58:48.048 --> 06:58:48.058 align:start position:0%
tonight or I'm Tom b or what
 
06:58:49.850 --> 06:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair I don't think that would be
 
06:58:51.170 --> 06:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
a challenge because usually looking at
 
06:58:52.548 --> 06:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
an agenda to determine if you're going
 
06:58:55.010 --> 06:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
and the agenda would state that
 
06:58:57.110 --> 06:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
um you know there's another bill coming
 
06:58:58.730 --> 06:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
up talking about the budget committee
 
06:59:00.948 --> 06:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
but we had a budget committee chair that
 
06:59:04.610 --> 06:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
rotated because she was in charge and
 
06:59:06.770 --> 06:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a problem when they had that
 
06:59:09.170 --> 06:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
they just made it clear which town it
 
06:59:11.030 --> 06:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
was which which which location they
 
06:59:13.070 --> 06:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
would be in I didn't see that as a as a
 
06:59:15.468 --> 06:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
problem any further questions from the
 
06:59:18.230 --> 06:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent whitcock thank
 
06:59:20.390 --> 06:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr Paul thank you my question
 
06:59:22.548 --> 06:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
about how many uh general public
 
06:59:24.410 --> 06:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
attended meeting
 
06:59:26.990 --> 06:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
it depends on the subjects that are on a
 
06:59:29.030 --> 06:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
regular night
 
06:59:32.868 --> 06:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
I'd say a a dozen or two dozen
 
06:59:34.368 --> 06:59:34.378 align:start position:0%
depending on what you're talking about
 
06:59:35.868 --> 06:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:59:39.590 --> 06:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:43.788 --> 06:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:43.798 --> 06:59:55.930 align:start position:0%
 
Barrett

06:59:55.930 --> 06:59:55.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:58.310 --> 06:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you again Sherman land for the
 
06:59:59.750 --> 06:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee good afternoon I won't be as
 
07:00:01.730 --> 07:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
brief as possible
 
07:00:03.410 --> 07:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
um I I want to thank representative we
 
07:00:04.670 --> 07:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
are opposed to the bill but I do want to
 
07:00:05.628 --> 07:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
thank representative Star Wars
 
07:00:06.830 --> 07:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
especially for his comment this is the
 
07:00:09.468 --> 07:00:09.478 align:start position:0%
play nice bill and I will agree with uh
 
07:00:11.628 --> 07:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
Mr power that indeed these are best
 
07:00:14.270 --> 07:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
practices in rotating the meetings
 
07:00:16.548 --> 07:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
um uh you know throughout um throughout
 
07:00:17.750 --> 07:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
the community
 
07:00:19.250 --> 07:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
um or the various communities in the
 
07:00:21.170 --> 07:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
various towns um within the Cooperative
 
07:00:23.448 --> 07:00:23.458 align:start position:0%
school district one of the concerns that
 
07:00:24.468 --> 07:00:24.478 align:start position:0%
we have
 
07:00:27.350 --> 07:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
um and Paige uh I get paid one line nine
 
07:00:29.330 --> 07:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
it says one school or Municipal
 
07:00:31.310 --> 07:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
facilities are available Municipal
 
07:00:33.368 --> 07:00:33.378 align:start position:0%
Municipal facilities may be available
 
07:00:35.570 --> 07:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean that
 
07:00:38.330 --> 07:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
they're conducive to having a meeting
 
07:00:41.868 --> 07:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
um I happen to meet representative Damon
 
07:00:44.448 --> 07:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
um uh before she was on the before she
 
07:00:46.610 --> 07:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
was elected here in at the Goshen school
 
07:00:48.590 --> 07:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
board meeting the Goshen School Board
 
07:00:50.448 --> 07:00:50.458 align:start position:0%
meets in the town hall that building is
 
07:00:54.708 --> 07:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
probably 150 years old if not because if
 
07:00:56.570 --> 07:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
not older I don't you know there's
 
07:00:58.850 --> 07:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
really no Wi-fi there's no AV there's no
 
07:01:01.190 --> 07:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
technology we're sitting on folding
 
07:01:04.128 --> 07:01:04.138 align:start position:0%
chairs and folding tables so it's a
 
07:01:06.468 --> 07:01:06.478 align:start position:0%
great old building though and but I love
 
07:01:10.010 --> 07:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
I love going out to Goshen um no I do I
 
07:01:12.770 --> 07:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
I one of my former board of directors
 
07:01:14.990 --> 07:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
John Scranton has been on that school
 
07:01:16.548 --> 07:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
board forever
 
07:01:18.170 --> 07:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
um kind of like my grandfather like he
 
07:01:19.368 --> 07:01:19.378 align:start position:0%
just he's just a great guy
 
07:01:21.230 --> 07:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative Damon knows John screen
 
07:01:23.448 --> 07:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
just uh he just he did everything he
 
07:01:24.770 --> 07:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
could to keep that ghost and loves the
 
07:01:25.910 --> 07:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
school to start together with his own
 
07:01:28.368 --> 07:01:28.378 align:start position:0%
two hands just a wonderful person
 
07:01:30.708 --> 07:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
um so I meant I meant no just by that by
 
07:01:33.350 --> 07:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
any means anyway aside from that um so
 
07:01:36.048 --> 07:01:36.058 align:start position:0%
the location you know yeah rotating them
 
07:01:38.510 --> 07:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know yeah that's a play nice thing
 
07:01:40.250 --> 07:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
but we also know and representative
 
07:01:41.750 --> 07:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
Damon you mentioned cure starch they
 
07:01:43.368 --> 07:01:43.378 align:start position:0%
have that whole I don't know where they
 
07:01:44.570 --> 07:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
meet but they have a whole professional
 
07:01:45.890 --> 07:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
development center there with like
 
07:01:48.410 --> 07:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
technology and things of that nature I
 
07:01:50.208 --> 07:01:50.218 align:start position:0%
know representative cordelli um at
 
07:01:51.948 --> 07:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
Governor Wentworth High School they've
 
07:01:53.330 --> 07:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
got um like a conference room and they
 
07:01:55.250 --> 07:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
able to have a media center where
 
07:01:57.170 --> 07:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
they're able to I think maybe broadcast
 
07:01:59.570 --> 07:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
live or stream or YouTube some of their
 
07:02:01.850 --> 07:02:01.860 align:start position:0%
video or some of their meetings so there
 
07:02:03.830 --> 07:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
may be some of those reasons why you're
 
07:02:05.628 --> 07:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
holding the meeting a specific location
 
07:02:08.030 --> 07:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
they've got the technology it's usually
 
07:02:09.410 --> 07:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
at a school
 
07:02:11.330 --> 07:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
um and yes other schools may have the
 
07:02:13.670 --> 07:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
technology as well too it's a best
 
07:02:15.410 --> 07:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
practice I don't think it necessary
 
07:02:18.048 --> 07:02:18.058 align:start position:0%
should necessarily be put in law and
 
07:02:19.610 --> 07:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
relative to the school board chair
 
07:02:22.190 --> 07:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
person I do appreciate the language that
 
07:02:24.770 --> 07:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
says unless the person next in line is
 
07:02:26.868 --> 07:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
is not willing to become the chairperson
 
07:02:28.190 --> 07:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
because when it was first
 
07:02:30.650 --> 07:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
conceptualizing this you know we have
 
07:02:34.430 --> 07:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
some some for example conval 13 school
 
07:02:36.410 --> 07:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
board members I believe I don't know 12
 
07:02:39.890 --> 07:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
or 13 towns but you know 13 school board
 
07:02:41.150 --> 07:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
members if you've never run a meeting
 
07:02:43.368 --> 07:02:43.378 align:start position:0%
before that could be a challenging task
 
07:02:45.650 --> 07:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
if you're you got elected on March 15th
 
07:02:47.390 --> 07:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
and on April 1st you're having to share
 
07:02:49.670 --> 07:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
a meeting of 13 people might be a little
 
07:02:51.890 --> 07:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
bit of a challenge with that said though
 
07:02:53.288 --> 07:02:53.298 align:start position:0%
we think that the school board should be
 
07:02:55.730 --> 07:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
allowed to elect who they want to elect
 
07:02:58.730 --> 07:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
as their chair and officers sometimes
 
07:03:01.430 --> 07:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's to help run the meeting you know if
 
07:03:03.530 --> 07:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
you have three or four new school board
 
07:03:05.448 --> 07:03:05.458 align:start position:0%
members it might make sense to have the
 
07:03:07.430 --> 07:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
person with the most experience running
 
07:03:09.230 --> 07:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
that meeting until you have a vice chair
 
07:03:11.390 --> 07:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
for a couple years to get up and and get
 
07:03:12.830 --> 07:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
used to it
 
07:03:15.590 --> 07:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
um you know and we don't rotate chairs
 
07:03:17.810 --> 07:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
in this committee every every session
 
07:03:19.548 --> 07:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
but there's a reason we do that there's
 
07:03:21.288 --> 07:03:21.298 align:start position:0%
historical knowledge there's historical
 
07:03:24.170 --> 07:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
background knowing the rules of of the
 
07:03:25.850 --> 07:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
legislature and this body you want
 
07:03:27.708 --> 07:03:27.718 align:start position:0%
somebody with experience necessarily to
 
07:03:30.650 --> 07:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
be in that seat to teach they're going
 
07:03:32.390 --> 07:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
to be the newbies until until next year
 
07:03:34.368 --> 07:03:34.378 align:start position:0%
folks I hope I hope that's okay just
 
07:03:36.048 --> 07:03:36.058 align:start position:0%
teach you the protocols and how to get
 
07:03:38.270 --> 07:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
around and and listen to customs and
 
07:03:40.250 --> 07:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
term Traditions that that go on in this
 
07:03:42.110 --> 07:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
building and local communities and local
 
07:03:43.610 --> 07:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
school boards and local school districts
 
07:03:45.890 --> 07:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
also have Customs Traditions fast
 
07:03:48.530 --> 07:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
practice so on and so forth so for those
 
07:03:50.930 --> 07:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
reasons um again we wholeheartedly agree
 
07:03:52.430 --> 07:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
these would be best practices and if
 
07:03:54.590 --> 07:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
everybody can get along and find a way
 
07:03:56.810 --> 07:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
to sort of do the rotation or whatnot
 
07:03:59.570 --> 07:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
you know more power to them but it's not
 
07:04:00.650 --> 07:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
something that we think should be
 
07:04:03.350 --> 07:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
mandated in law and I would be happy to
 
07:04:05.270 --> 07:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you very much
 
07:04:06.770 --> 07:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for our repair
 
07:04:10.250 --> 07:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
Christina yes represent dry thank you Mr
 
07:04:11.690 --> 07:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
07:04:11.700 --> 07:04:12.530 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

07:04:12.530 --> 07:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:04:14.750 --> 07:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
um coming from a town that was a small
 
07:04:17.150 --> 07:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
player and a large SAU
 
07:04:19.010 --> 07:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
um a weighted vote
 
07:04:21.288 --> 07:04:21.298 align:start position:0%
um helped us to equalize our position on
 
07:04:23.448 --> 07:04:23.458 align:start position:0%
the school board uh The Joint School
 
07:04:25.610 --> 07:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
Board and I wondered if you would think
 
07:04:27.590 --> 07:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
that that might be a solution that we
 
07:04:29.990 --> 07:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
could put in that would allow the vote
 
07:04:32.570 --> 07:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
to be taken and elect someone but with a
 
07:04:34.190 --> 07:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
weighted vote sure thank you thank you
 
07:04:36.650 --> 07:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
for the question representative
 
07:04:39.048 --> 07:04:39.058 align:start position:0%
um we're conflating two different issues
 
07:04:40.730 --> 07:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
here we're conflating the weighted
 
07:04:43.070 --> 07:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
voting under the school administrative
 
07:04:45.468 --> 07:04:45.478 align:start position:0%
unit statute the saus that we talked
 
07:04:45.478 --> 07:04:46.310 align:start position:0%
unit statute the saus that we talked
about

07:04:46.310 --> 07:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:04:49.250 --> 07:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
the last bill I was up here that's the
 
07:04:52.670 --> 07:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
weighted voters in RSA 194c
 
07:04:55.788 --> 07:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
I forget what it is seven eight maybe I
 
07:04:57.350 --> 07:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
forget where the weighted voting statute
 
07:04:58.788 --> 07:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
is this is dealing with Cooperative
 
07:05:01.190 --> 07:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
school districts which are multiple
 
07:05:03.530 --> 07:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
towns forming a single political entity
 
07:05:05.030 --> 07:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
what can I ask what town you're from
 
07:05:05.040 --> 07:05:06.530 align:start position:0%
what can I ask what town you're from
representative

07:05:06.530 --> 07:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:05:08.330 --> 07:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
yes Plainfield
 
07:05:12.770 --> 07:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
Plainfield so you are in an SAU 32 you
 
07:05:14.628 --> 07:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
are not you're a single District
 
07:05:18.048 --> 07:05:18.058 align:start position:0%
yes this is our past history oh okay all
 
07:05:19.670 --> 07:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
right who are we can I just ask who you
 
07:05:21.230 --> 07:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
were hooked up who are you involved like
 
07:05:23.810 --> 07:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
who you were in the SAU with Grantham
 
07:05:25.250 --> 07:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
okay you were with Grant them at the
 
07:05:26.868 --> 07:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
time in Lebanon okay and then I know
 
07:05:30.170 --> 07:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
Grantham split their SAU 75 now in
 
07:05:32.750 --> 07:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
Lebanon is now SAU 78. so that would
 
07:05:34.670 --> 07:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
have been your SAU that would have been
 
07:05:37.090 --> 07:05:37.100 align:start position:0%
the three communities coming together
 
07:05:39.590 --> 07:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
for the administrative services that we
 
07:05:41.150 --> 07:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
talked about before your superintendent
 
07:05:43.010 --> 07:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
business manager special ed director
 
07:05:44.930 --> 07:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
this deals with Cooperative school
 
07:05:46.310 --> 07:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
districts like the Cure Sarge
 
07:05:47.750 --> 07:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school district for Five
 
07:05:50.330 --> 07:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
Towns through articles of agreement a
 
07:05:52.730 --> 07:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
contract essentially agreed to form one
 
07:05:54.948 --> 07:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
single political entity the co-op School
 
07:05:58.190 --> 07:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
District so they're there there's apples
 
07:05:59.990 --> 07:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
and oranges here representing
 
07:06:02.090 --> 07:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
respectfully if you need more
 
07:06:03.830 --> 07:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
information by all means like email me
 
07:06:05.570 --> 07:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
call me I'm happy to sort of go through
 
07:06:07.070 --> 07:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
the nuances and the differences between
 
07:06:09.770 --> 07:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
both of those and if I could one second
 
07:06:11.690 --> 07:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
um representative Damon I believe I
 
07:06:13.430 --> 07:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
counted real quick
 
07:06:16.190 --> 07:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
um there are 32 Ops I believe I counted
 
07:06:18.650 --> 07:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
a hundred 110 pounds I could be wrong on
 
07:06:21.048 --> 07:06:21.058 align:start position:0%
that though I I was I was trying to
 
07:06:22.670 --> 07:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
count them two I've got a sheet here my
 
07:06:25.968 --> 07:06:25.978 align:start position:0%
own document uh I think I was about 110
 
07:06:28.430 --> 07:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
but give or take five ten on either end
 
07:06:31.070 --> 07:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:32.990 --> 07:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
are the questions do you know if there's
 
07:06:35.510 --> 07:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
any articles of agreement and we know
 
07:06:35.520 --> 07:06:36.410 align:start position:0%
any articles of agreement and we know
that

07:06:36.410 --> 07:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:06:38.030 --> 07:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
several of our co-ops don't have
 
07:06:39.948 --> 07:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
articles yeah they were created many
 
07:06:43.070 --> 07:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
moons ago yeah however do is this
 
07:06:44.570 --> 07:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
something that might be in some of the
 
07:06:46.850 --> 07:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
Articles of agreement yeah I think for
 
07:06:49.788 --> 07:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
the question Mr chair it could it could
 
07:06:52.430 --> 07:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
be I don't know I'm not familiar with
 
07:06:55.010 --> 07:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
any articles of agreement myself where
 
07:06:57.410 --> 07:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
I've seen this provision
 
07:07:00.288 --> 07:07:00.298 align:start position:0%
um I would also probably recommend that
 
07:07:03.530 --> 07:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
it not be put in articles if somebody
 
07:07:04.910 --> 07:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
were to ask me should we met our
 
07:07:06.288 --> 07:07:06.298 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement to do this I'd say
 
07:07:08.330 --> 07:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
it should probably be a board policy or
 
07:07:10.190 --> 07:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
board internal practice because articles
 
07:07:11.690 --> 07:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
of agreement are tough to change you
 
07:07:13.788 --> 07:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
have to go out to the voters you have to
 
07:07:15.830 --> 07:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
you have to vote on them you know this
 
07:07:17.208 --> 07:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
way a board could just say you know what
 
07:07:18.650 --> 07:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to start doing this because
 
07:07:20.510 --> 07:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
we think it's the right thing or because
 
07:07:23.030 --> 07:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
we've had constituents ask us to do it I
 
07:07:24.410 --> 07:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
think it'd be easier it'd be it'd be
 
07:07:27.230 --> 07:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
more malleable for the board to to do
 
07:07:28.368 --> 07:07:28.378 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to do through through
 
07:07:33.830 --> 07:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:36.650 --> 07:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
prep sound forward thank you Mr chair
 
07:07:40.250 --> 07:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
07:07:43.430 --> 07:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
praise this as carefully as I can but
 
07:07:46.850 --> 07:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
do are you aware of any circumstances in
 
07:07:46.860 --> 07:07:47.990 align:start position:0%
do are you aware of any circumstances in
which

07:07:47.990 --> 07:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
07:07:48.000 --> 07:07:52.250 align:start position:0%
which
prior

07:07:52.250 --> 07:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:55.010 --> 07:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
competition existed between the two
 
07:07:57.288 --> 07:07:57.298 align:start position:0%
units before they were purged the two
 
07:08:00.770 --> 07:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
and cooked communities uh that might
 
07:08:03.650 --> 07:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
have affected this particular business I
 
07:08:06.410 --> 07:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
I could follow this for the footnote I
 
07:08:08.448 --> 07:08:08.458 align:start position:0%
sat on the on the Hollis board for a
 
07:08:11.468 --> 07:08:11.478 align:start position:0%
year okay before we moved out of state
 
07:08:14.510 --> 07:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
you did this did not surprise me at all
 
07:08:17.270 --> 07:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
right so thank you for the question
 
07:08:17.280 --> 07:08:19.128 align:start position:0%
right so thank you for the question
um representative

07:08:19.128 --> 07:08:19.138 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
07:08:19.138 --> 07:08:19.968 align:start position:0%
um representative
um

07:08:19.968 --> 07:08:19.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:21.430 --> 07:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
07:08:23.868 --> 07:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
disagreements Pro I mean so many of the
 
07:08:25.548 --> 07:08:25.558 align:start position:0%
co-ops have been create will created
 
07:08:28.670 --> 07:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
decades ago long before my time many of
 
07:08:31.430 --> 07:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
them we know were first grade you're
 
07:08:34.010 --> 07:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
right and one right so how's Brooklyn I
 
07:08:38.448 --> 07:08:38.458 align:start position:0%
think early 90s if I'm not mistaken 91
 
07:08:41.750 --> 07:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so I you know I I know there were a
 
07:08:43.850 --> 07:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
few I think the Exeter Co-op was created
 
07:08:47.448 --> 07:08:47.458 align:start position:0%
in 96 if I'm not mistaken that's Exeter
 
07:08:49.730 --> 07:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
in the four or five surrounding towns
 
07:08:53.030 --> 07:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
new fields and some of the other ones
 
07:08:55.610 --> 07:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
um you know those those communities came
 
07:08:57.230 --> 07:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
together and said that this is a good
 
07:08:58.730 --> 07:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
idea whether or not that was for
 
07:09:00.350 --> 07:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
educational purposes whether or not that
 
07:09:02.090 --> 07:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
was for fiscal prudency or some
 
07:09:03.770 --> 07:09:03.780 align:start position:0%
combination thereof
 
07:09:07.128 --> 07:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I don't know but I am aware that
 
07:09:09.230 --> 07:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
there was a distinct feeling in Hollis
 
07:09:10.868 --> 07:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
that they were better
 
07:09:14.948 --> 07:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
I I I can't I can't speak to that
 
07:09:17.628 --> 07:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
should we ask Mr power his opinion on
 
07:09:21.590 --> 07:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:23.930 --> 07:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I think any any other questions I
 
07:09:27.070 --> 07:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
think I'm good uh within uh County
 
07:09:29.810 --> 07:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
Administration I've been on the county
 
07:09:32.570 --> 07:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
executive board of Grafton County our
 
07:09:35.750 --> 07:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
delegation and shared that and we got in
 
07:09:37.690 --> 07:09:37.700 align:start position:0%
some labor issues
 
07:09:41.750 --> 07:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
and the chair and vice chair were called
 
07:09:45.708 --> 07:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
in to address with folks those issues in
 
07:09:48.350 --> 07:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
case it went a little bit further
 
07:09:50.570 --> 07:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
um does in regard to this now we're
 
07:09:53.330 --> 07:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
talking now a a school level
 
07:09:56.830 --> 07:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
is the chair of the Cooperative board
 
07:09:59.570 --> 07:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
have different responsibilities than
 
07:10:02.448 --> 07:10:02.458 align:start position:0%
other members of the board so thank you
 
07:10:04.150 --> 07:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question chairman Ladd
 
07:10:07.128 --> 07:10:07.138 align:start position:0%
nhsba advises that the chair of a school
 
07:10:10.850 --> 07:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
board is the first among equals the only
 
07:10:13.610 --> 07:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
way per statue no there's no
 
07:10:15.770 --> 07:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
distinguishment of a board share versus
 
07:10:17.750 --> 07:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
a quote unquote regular school board
 
07:10:20.570 --> 07:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
meeting in terms of Statute the school
 
07:10:24.048 --> 07:10:24.058 align:start position:0%
board by its own vote either policy or
 
07:10:27.410 --> 07:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
single time instance vote motion Etc can
 
07:10:29.810 --> 07:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
grant a board chair additional Authority
 
07:10:31.910 --> 07:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
for example we have a sample policy that
 
07:10:34.190 --> 07:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
says roles and responsibilities or
 
07:10:35.810 --> 07:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
duties of the board chair and that's
 
07:10:38.270 --> 07:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
usually consult the superintendent on
 
07:10:39.830 --> 07:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
setting the agenda up perhaps
 
07:10:42.288 --> 07:10:42.298 align:start position:0%
authorization to sign contracts on
 
07:10:44.690 --> 07:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
behalf of the school board
 
07:10:46.310 --> 07:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think you don't have to
 
07:10:48.288 --> 07:10:48.298 align:start position:0%
be a spokesperson with the press for the
 
07:10:50.868 --> 07:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
for this for the school board but as a
 
07:10:53.270 --> 07:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
matter of law there's no distinguishment
 
07:10:55.368 --> 07:10:55.378 align:start position:0%
between a chair and any other elected
 
07:10:58.128 --> 07:10:58.138 align:start position:0%
School Board member the authority and
 
07:11:00.650 --> 07:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
power of a board chair has to be given
 
07:11:02.330 --> 07:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
to that chair by the board itself
 
07:11:05.930 --> 07:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:08.690 --> 07:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Damon
 
07:11:09.890 --> 07:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
one more
 
07:11:11.390 --> 07:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
is there any precedent for any
 
07:11:13.788 --> 07:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
cooperatives having co-chairs
 
07:11:15.708 --> 07:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
it's a good question thank you
 
07:11:15.718 --> 07:11:17.810 align:start position:0%
it's a good question thank you
um

07:11:17.810 --> 07:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:19.910 --> 07:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any
 
07:11:21.468 --> 07:11:21.478 align:start position:0%
I mean there's usually a chair and a
 
07:11:24.170 --> 07:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
vice chair if the chair you know is
 
07:11:26.150 --> 07:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
absent or for whatever reason the vice
 
07:11:28.190 --> 07:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
chair fulfills those duties that's again
 
07:11:30.350 --> 07:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
also a matter of either vocal practice
 
07:11:33.650 --> 07:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
or board policy but co-chairs I don't
 
07:11:35.208 --> 07:11:35.218 align:start position:0%
recall ever seeing that if it's happened
 
07:11:36.968 --> 07:11:36.978 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware
 
07:11:39.788 --> 07:11:39.798 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
07:11:44.390 --> 07:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:47.570 --> 07:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
we have no further cards on this one
 
07:11:51.368 --> 07:11:51.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:58.368 --> 07:11:58.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:02.150 --> 07:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go right into 632 this
 
07:12:03.650 --> 07:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
is relative to Cooperative School
 
07:12:05.690 --> 07:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
District budget committee
 
07:12:05.700 --> 07:12:07.490 align:start position:0%
District budget committee
um

07:12:07.490 --> 07:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:13.788 --> 07:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:15.350 --> 07:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
I don't have in front of me right now if
 
07:12:16.730 --> 07:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
I representative SARS I'm assuming
 
07:12:18.650 --> 07:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
you're the prime sponsor
 
07:12:25.490 --> 07:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:27.468 --> 07:12:27.478 align:start position:0%
this is what happens when you say yes
 
07:12:31.310 --> 07:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
yes there you go you got it I gotta
 
07:12:32.570 --> 07:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
learn a little bit more this is my first
 
07:12:34.730 --> 07:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
time through so anyways uh
 
07:12:37.910 --> 07:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative sellers grabbed an 18.
 
07:12:43.150 --> 07:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
um again this is uh 632 hb632 it is the
 
07:12:46.850 --> 07:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
almost identical if not identical to the
 
07:12:49.010 --> 07:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
last one we did about the school board
 
07:12:51.230 --> 07:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
this is about the budget committee all
 
07:12:55.430 --> 07:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
right so again playing nice yeah as as I
 
07:12:57.530 --> 07:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
want to use that term is what it's all
 
07:13:00.410 --> 07:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
about and also rotating where the
 
07:13:03.850 --> 07:13:03.860 align:start position:0%
meetings are and also rotating the chair
 
07:13:06.410 --> 07:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
07:13:06.420 --> 07:13:07.310 align:start position:0%
at that point
um

07:13:07.310 --> 07:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:09.708 --> 07:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to think as far as
 
07:13:12.230 --> 07:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know when you have a when you have a
 
07:13:16.010 --> 07:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
larger uh several town
 
07:13:20.510 --> 07:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
within the uh the co-op here or the
 
07:13:23.230 --> 07:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
district they normally don't change
 
07:13:26.150 --> 07:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
every single person out the same year
 
07:13:29.208 --> 07:13:29.218 align:start position:0%
it's always you know one or two people
 
07:13:31.910 --> 07:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
that are on the boards or committees
 
07:13:34.010 --> 07:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
will be changed out or voted in or voted
 
07:13:37.850 --> 07:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
out during that time so you know I look
 
07:13:40.610 --> 07:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
at this as the you're going to lose all
 
07:13:42.890 --> 07:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
your knowledge and stuff and maybe they
 
07:13:45.230 --> 07:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
won't have the right person to take over
 
07:13:48.110 --> 07:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
the chairperson and again I don't think
 
07:13:50.390 --> 07:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
that would be the case but also there's
 
07:13:52.250 --> 07:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
language in here to say they don't have
 
07:13:55.788 --> 07:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
to you know so if they can decline that
 
07:13:58.310 --> 07:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
and they can still move forward so I
 
07:13:59.330 --> 07:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
don't want to really add too much more
 
07:14:01.490 --> 07:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's really the same stuff over it just
 
07:14:03.590 --> 07:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the budget committee
 
07:14:05.810 --> 07:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions of
 
07:14:05.820 --> 07:14:08.270 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions of
Representative

07:14:08.270 --> 07:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
07:14:09.530 --> 07:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:14:09.540 --> 07:14:11.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

07:14:11.390 --> 07:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:14:13.610 --> 07:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
Eric are you testifying this one too I
 
07:14:15.650 --> 07:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
don't see the card here but must it
 
07:14:23.468 --> 07:14:23.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:26.390 --> 07:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
Eric power from Brookline president of
 
07:14:28.730 --> 07:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
sdga New Hampshire
 
07:14:31.430 --> 07:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
um speaking in favor of this bill
 
07:14:33.410 --> 07:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
this bill is similar to the last one
 
07:14:35.750 --> 07:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
this one's about Cooperative budget
 
07:14:38.330 --> 07:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
committees not every Co-op has a budget
 
07:14:40.788 --> 07:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
committee many do
 
07:14:43.730 --> 07:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
um the idea is similar to rotate the
 
07:14:46.368 --> 07:14:46.378 align:start position:0%
chair if there's a willing person in in
 
07:14:48.530 --> 07:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
the other town or the another town so
 
07:14:50.150 --> 07:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't say the leadership of
 
07:14:51.590 --> 07:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
the budget committee doesn't stay in the
 
07:14:52.610 --> 07:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
same town
 
07:14:52.620 --> 07:14:54.708 align:start position:0%
same town
perpetually

07:14:54.708 --> 07:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
perpetually
 
07:14:57.788 --> 07:14:57.798 align:start position:0%
um just to speak to
 
07:15:01.610 --> 07:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
Alice Brookline we've had the same chair
 
07:15:05.030 --> 07:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
from Hollis in charge of it since I
 
07:15:08.570 --> 07:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
think 2012. so we're 11 or 12 years
 
07:15:10.610 --> 07:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
where it's been Hollis hands the last
 
07:15:12.288 --> 07:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
time it was actually in brookline's
 
07:15:14.690 --> 07:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
hands was my wife Diane power
 
07:15:16.610 --> 07:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
representative power she was the chair
 
07:15:18.788 --> 07:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
of the budcom committee I think in 2012.
 
07:15:22.250 --> 07:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
since then it's been with Hollis but the
 
07:15:23.628 --> 07:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
budget committee though you're setting
 
07:15:25.730 --> 07:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
the budget for the the school district
 
07:15:28.430 --> 07:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a fairly uh powerful
 
07:15:31.430 --> 07:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee and committee you know even
 
07:15:33.230 --> 07:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
though we've joined together in a co-op
 
07:15:35.330 --> 07:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
Brookline has its character Hollis has
 
07:15:36.590 --> 07:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
its character
 
07:15:38.030 --> 07:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at how much we
 
07:15:40.390 --> 07:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
spend in our k-6 districts
 
07:15:43.490 --> 07:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
you see that Hollis spends about five to
 
07:15:44.868 --> 07:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
six thousand dollars more per student
 
07:15:47.208 --> 07:15:47.218 align:start position:0%
than Brookline does and then we come to
 
07:15:50.150 --> 07:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
the co-op uh their number comes down and
 
07:15:52.250 --> 07:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
our number comes up because the towns
 
07:15:54.288 --> 07:15:54.298 align:start position:0%
have different priorities different ways
 
07:15:55.670 --> 07:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
they want to do it so when you have a
 
07:15:57.530 --> 07:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
budget committee that's continually
 
07:15:59.750 --> 07:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
controlled by one town
 
07:16:01.910 --> 07:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's probably not healthy it should be
 
07:16:05.448 --> 07:16:05.458 align:start position:0%
rotated around and just a one other
 
07:16:08.030 --> 07:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
Nuance to consider with a with a budget
 
07:16:08.040 --> 07:16:09.590 align:start position:0%
Nuance to consider with a with a budget
committee

07:16:09.590 --> 07:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:16:10.850 --> 07:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
um if you're familiar with the budget
 
07:16:13.128 --> 07:16:13.138 align:start position:0%
committee a budget committee assigns in
 
07:16:15.170 --> 07:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
a normal town the budget committee that
 
07:16:17.208 --> 07:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
exists in a town would assign a school
 
07:16:18.650 --> 07:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
board member and a select board member
 
07:16:20.930 --> 07:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
to be ex-officio members so a
 
07:16:22.670 --> 07:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
five-person budget committee would then
 
07:16:25.070 --> 07:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
be seven well we don't have really a
 
07:16:26.930 --> 07:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
select board for a co-op because it's
 
07:16:28.968 --> 07:16:28.978 align:start position:0%
multiple towns but you do have a school
 
07:16:31.610 --> 07:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
board member that gets assigned to be on
 
07:16:35.090 --> 07:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
the budget committee and votes and so in
 
07:16:36.590 --> 07:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
my I don't even think there was a year
 
07:16:38.510 --> 07:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
where we have had that school board
 
07:16:40.010 --> 07:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
member be from Brookline because that's
 
07:16:42.410 --> 07:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
appointed by the chair again the chair
 
07:16:44.330 --> 07:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
picks who's on the budget committee and
 
07:16:44.340 --> 07:16:45.048 align:start position:0%
picks who's on the budget committee and
it's

07:16:45.048 --> 07:16:45.058 align:start position:0%
it's
 
07:16:46.670 --> 07:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
spend the person from The Big Town
 
07:16:48.170 --> 07:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
Hollis all the time
 
07:16:50.208 --> 07:16:50.218 align:start position:0%
so that's that can happen that happens
 
07:16:52.610 --> 07:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
in others if you see who signed this
 
07:16:55.010 --> 07:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this bill you can see it's
 
07:16:58.610 --> 07:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
a problem in other towns you know that
 
07:17:00.350 --> 07:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
have caused well nine Borough we have
 
07:17:02.030 --> 07:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative post who signed on this
 
07:17:03.708 --> 07:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
she's in the smaller town of lineborough
 
07:17:05.690 --> 07:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
so this happens with the budget
 
07:17:07.010 --> 07:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
committee this happens with the school
 
07:17:07.020 --> 07:17:07.930 align:start position:0%
committee this happens with the school
board

07:17:07.930 --> 07:17:07.940 align:start position:0%
board
 
07:17:09.610 --> 07:17:09.620 align:start position:0%
and again
 
07:17:12.288 --> 07:17:12.298 align:start position:0%
when my wife was the chair of the bud
 
07:17:14.810 --> 07:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
com she did rotate the meetings as a
 
07:17:16.730 --> 07:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
good practice but that was completely
 
07:17:19.190 --> 07:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
discontinued when it got taken over and
 
07:17:21.708 --> 07:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
now it's been in Hollis continuously and
 
07:17:24.110 --> 07:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
so it can happen but it has to be the
 
07:17:25.610 --> 07:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
good will of Brewers whoever the chair
 
07:17:27.830 --> 07:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
is and the committee building being
 
07:17:30.650 --> 07:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
willing to do it so again for the same
 
07:17:33.048 --> 07:17:33.058 align:start position:0%
reasons let's make co-ops more
 
07:17:36.948 --> 07:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
Cooperative by you know rotating the
 
07:17:39.048 --> 07:17:39.058 align:start position:0%
chair and rotating the meeting places
 
07:17:41.510 --> 07:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
and that gets people to feel like a
 
07:17:44.330 --> 07:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
little bit more part of a co-op if we're
 
07:17:46.850 --> 07:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
able to do that a small step
 
07:17:48.650 --> 07:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
07:17:50.810 --> 07:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
07:17:56.510 --> 07:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:59.208 --> 07:17:59.218 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you thank you sir on
 
07:18:00.730 --> 07:18:00.740 align:start position:0%
this bill in the last bill
 
07:18:04.670 --> 07:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
has the full Co-op School Board had a
 
07:18:06.948 --> 07:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
chance to realize these are both here
 
07:18:08.750 --> 07:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
because Hollis and Brookline know that
 
07:18:11.030 --> 07:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
this stuff is here I didn't talk to them
 
07:18:13.190 --> 07:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
about it necessarily but I've talked to
 
07:18:16.730 --> 07:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
the sdga organization who's brought this
 
07:18:19.190 --> 07:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
forward okay but but so you're telling
 
07:18:22.368 --> 07:18:22.378 align:start position:0%
me to be correctly that uh a fairly 20
 
07:18:23.810 --> 07:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
years that was more powerful they are
 
07:18:25.670 --> 07:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
aware of it they are aware of it they
 
07:18:26.810 --> 07:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
are aware of it they put it in their
 
07:18:28.730 --> 07:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
minutes that they're aware of it so
 
07:18:31.310 --> 07:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
they've talked about it okay thank you
 
07:18:33.288 --> 07:18:33.298 align:start position:0%
they didn't say they liked it and they
 
07:18:34.910 --> 07:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
didn't say they didn't like it thank you
 
07:18:37.788 --> 07:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chair for the questions
 
07:18:41.510 --> 07:18:41.520 align:start position:0%

07:18:47.760 --> 07:18:49.368 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:18:49.368 --> 07:18:49.378 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:18:56.628 --> 07:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
