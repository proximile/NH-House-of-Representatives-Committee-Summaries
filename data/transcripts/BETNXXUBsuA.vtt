00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
now because I think about when I think
 

00:33:29.639 --> 00:33:32.350 align:start position:0%
now because I think about when I think
about<00:33:30.039><c> what</c><00:33:30.200><c> we're</c><00:33:30.679><c> doing</c><00:33:31.679><c> in</c><00:33:31.840><c> the</c><00:33:32.080><c> high</c>

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
about what we're doing in the high
 

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.310 align:start position:0%
about what we're doing in the high
conflict<00:33:32.840><c> cases</c><00:33:33.159><c> so</c><00:33:33.440><c> just</c><00:33:33.639><c> trying</c><00:33:33.880><c> to</c><00:33:34.080><c> figure</c>

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
conflict cases so just trying to figure
 

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.789 align:start position:0%
conflict cases so just trying to figure
out<00:33:34.600><c> because</c><00:33:34.840><c> our</c><00:33:35.080><c> schedules</c><00:33:35.480><c> are</c><00:33:35.679><c> weird</c><00:33:36.120><c> and</c>

00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
out because our schedules are weird and
 

00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:39.909 align:start position:0%
out because our schedules are weird and
that's<00:33:37.039><c> not</c><00:33:37.799><c> high</c><00:33:38.399><c> conflict</c><00:33:39.399><c> the</c><00:33:39.559><c> kind</c><00:33:39.760><c> that</c>

00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
that's not high conflict the kind that
 

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:41.710 align:start position:0%
that's not high conflict the kind that
I'm<00:33:40.080><c> thinking</c><00:33:40.440><c> of</c><00:33:40.679><c> like</c><00:33:40.840><c> the</c><00:33:41.000><c> high</c><00:33:41.279><c> conflict</c>

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of like the high conflict
 

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.789 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of like the high conflict
where<00:33:41.880><c> we</c><00:33:42.039><c> have</c><00:33:42.159><c> to</c><00:33:42.360><c> go</c><00:33:42.559><c> to</c><00:33:42.799><c> another</c><00:33:43.279><c> party</c><00:33:43.600><c> and</c>

00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
where we have to go to another party and
 

00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:46.149 align:start position:0%
where we have to go to another party and

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
say you know either help mitigate this
 

00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:47.870 align:start position:0%

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
or what are the complicating factors
 

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.710 align:start position:0%
or what are the complicating factors

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
were very helpful even though there were
 

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.710 align:start position:0%
were very helpful even though there were
few<00:37:15.560><c> uh</c><00:37:15.680><c> and</c><00:37:15.800><c> it</c><00:37:15.960><c> just</c><00:37:16.160><c> made</c><00:37:16.480><c> sense</c><00:37:16.760><c> to</c><00:37:16.920><c> me</c><00:37:17.599><c> uh</c>

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
few uh and it just made sense to me uh
 

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.430 align:start position:0%
few uh and it just made sense to me uh
so<00:37:17.920><c> that's</c><00:37:18.119><c> why</c><00:37:18.280><c> I'm</c><00:37:18.440><c> willing</c><00:37:18.720><c> to</c><00:37:19.079><c> risk</c><00:37:20.079><c> agree</c>

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
very discretional and if there was I
 

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.910 align:start position:0%
very discretional and if there was I
would<00:40:31.640><c> think</c><00:40:32.359><c> these</c><00:40:32.520><c> would</c><00:40:32.720><c> be</c><00:40:32.960><c> like</c><00:40:33.440><c> the</c><00:40:33.640><c> for</c>

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
would think these would be like the for
 

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.190 align:start position:0%
would think these would be like the for
the<00:40:34.640><c> for</c><00:40:34.839><c> the</c><00:40:34.920><c> fund</c><00:40:35.200><c> to</c><00:40:35.359><c> be</c><00:40:35.520><c> used</c><00:40:35.800><c> that</c><00:40:35.920><c> would</c>

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
the for the fund to be used that would
 

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.470 align:start position:0%
the for the fund to be used that would
probably<00:40:36.599><c> be</c><00:40:36.839><c> more</c><00:40:37.200><c> like</c><00:40:37.359><c> a</c><00:40:37.720><c> very</c><00:40:38.040><c> special</c>

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
probably be more like a very special
 

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.309 align:start position:0%
probably be more like a very special
case

00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
case
 

00:40:39.319 --> 00:40:43.109 align:start position:0%

00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%

00:40:43.119 --> 00:40:44.150 align:start position:0%
scenario um and not like a typical thing
I<00:40:43.240><c> know</c><00:40:43.359><c> that</c><00:40:43.480><c> they</c><00:40:43.599><c> have</c><00:40:43.680><c> a</c><00:40:43.800><c> limited</c>

where you know a judge is like I I
actually<00:40:54.079><c> think</c><00:40:54.319><c> these</c><00:40:54.520><c> parties</c><00:40:54.880><c> could</c><00:40:55.079><c> come</c>

actually think these parties could come
 

00:40:55.359 --> 00:40:56.630 align:start position:0%
actually think these parties could come

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
together and maybe agree on something
 

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.349 align:start position:0%
together and maybe agree on something
they<00:40:56.800><c> just</c><00:40:56.920><c> need</c><00:40:57.240><c> the</c><00:40:57.400><c> right</c><00:40:57.640><c> person</c><00:40:57.880><c> to</c><00:40:58.079><c> help</c>

00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
they just need the right person to help

them
um

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.990 align:start position:0%
um
yeah<00:41:02.760><c> yeah</c><00:41:02.880><c> and</c><00:41:02.960><c> I</c><00:41:03.079><c> would</c><00:41:03.240><c> think</c><00:41:03.520><c> that</c><00:41:03.760><c> the</c>

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%

00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
think that was a great disservice that
 

00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:07.069 align:start position:0%
think that was a great disservice that
unfortunately<00:44:05.920><c> happened</c><00:44:06.359><c> within</c><00:44:06.599><c> our</c><00:44:06.800><c> state</c>

00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately happened within our state
 

00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:09.790 align:start position:0%
unfortunately happened within our state
when<00:44:07.280><c> we</c><00:44:07.760><c> didn't</c><00:44:08.240><c> no</c><00:44:08.480><c> longer</c><00:44:08.760><c> funded</c><00:44:09.240><c> that</c>

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
when we didn't no longer funded that
 

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.670 align:start position:0%
when we didn't no longer funded that
program<00:44:10.800><c> but</c><00:44:11.040><c> besides</c><00:44:11.480><c> that</c><00:44:11.720><c> I</c><00:44:11.800><c> think</c><00:44:12.240><c> this</c>

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
program but besides that I think this
 

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.430 align:start position:0%
program but besides that I think this
and<00:44:12.800><c> then</c><00:44:13.079><c> that</c><00:44:13.280><c> having</c><00:44:13.559><c> the</c><00:44:13.839><c> attorney</c><00:44:14.839><c> um</c><00:44:14.960><c> for</c>

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then that having the attorney um for
 

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.870 align:start position:0%
and then that having the attorney um for
Miners<00:44:15.920><c> and</c><00:44:16.119><c> stuff</c><00:44:16.440><c> I</c><00:44:16.559><c> think</c><00:44:16.800><c> that</c><00:44:17.440><c> these</c><00:44:17.640><c> two</c>

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
Miners and stuff I think that these two
 

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.630 align:start position:0%
Miners and stuff I think that these two
are<00:44:18.160><c> steps</c><00:44:18.480><c> in</c><00:44:18.640><c> the</c><00:44:18.760><c> right</c><00:44:18.960><c> direction</c><00:44:19.400><c> I</c><00:44:19.520><c> think</c>

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
are steps in the right direction I think
 

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.750 align:start position:0%
are steps in the right direction I think
the<00:44:19.800><c> next</c><00:44:20.160><c> big</c><00:44:20.400><c> step</c><00:44:20.680><c> would</c><00:44:20.839><c> be</c><00:44:21.319><c> getting</c><00:44:21.599><c> that</c>

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
the next big step would be getting that
 

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.829 align:start position:0%
the next big step would be getting that
funded<00:44:22.240><c> again</c><00:44:22.440><c> and</c><00:44:22.640><c> I</c><00:44:22.800><c> just</c><00:44:23.240><c> I</c><00:44:23.520><c> that's</c><00:44:23.720><c> not</c>
