00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
and open up the special subcommittee on
 
00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinators
 
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
slg's and today we will be working on
 
00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
the parenting coordinator part of
 
00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.870 align:start position:0%
the parenting coordinator part of
this

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
we have a bill House Bill 1263
 
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
I think needs a little bit of work
 
00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 align:start position:0%
before it's supposed to be exec tomorrow
 
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
would like us to look and see if if we
 
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
think that we can kind of make something
 
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
work about it since we did think that
 
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
this was important enough of a topic to
 
00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee on it I feel like we
 
00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
to complete
 
00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
this for this year if we can if we can
 
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
can't then that's okay but I'd like to
 
00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
one yes
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
rreg thank you madam chairwoman um so
 
00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I'm noticing and
 
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
I think we've heard come up from our
 
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
Advocates too is that we don't really
 
00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
have um one of the you know one of the
 
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
stickiest parts we have when we're
 
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
looking at um helping parents out is is
 
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence portion and so
 
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
having some training um in domestic
 
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
violence would be a big one we don't
 
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
have any kind of a a carve out to help
 
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
with that I think that's probably one of
 
00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 align:start position:0%
those areas that we have the most
 
00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 align:start position:0%
confusion around kind of what that means
 
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
and what that's looking at so I'd like
 
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
to see something with that another
 
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
complication that I've heard uh you know
 
00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
some people talk about is where is this
 
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
training going to come from and who's
 
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
kind of mitigate that or keep an eye on
 
00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 align:start position:0%
that so just a couple thoughts that I
 
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
have in my notes from that
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you those are good points I
 
00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 align:start position:0%
did look into what a few of the other
 
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
states are doing and some of the other
 
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
states the court actually does the
 
00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 align:start position:0%
training themselves um I know in New
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
Jersey they do and they kind of Branch
 
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 align:start position:0%
it off in two different ways where you
 
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
could be a parenting coordinator just
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
for General cases or if you also want to
 
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 align:start position:0%
do domestic violence cases then you have
 
00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
to complete I think it's in let me see
 
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
what the number of hours were for the
 
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 align:start position:0%
training program and I know
 
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.190 align:start position:0%
training program and I know
[Music]

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
um I did look around and several other
 
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.750 align:start position:0%
um I did look around and several other
states

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
do um have this with DV and I did want
 
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
to say I know that there was some
 
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
concern brought up with using this with
 
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 align:start position:0%
with DV cases in general but there are
 
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
several other states that are doing it
 
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
and it
 
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't and it's the amount of time that
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
they've been doing it for I would think
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
that if it was creating a big problem
 
00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 align:start position:0%
they would have repealed it by now um so
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to add in the training for it
 
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
I do I know that there was concern about
 
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps like oh exclude DV from there
 
00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
which my personal opinion and I'd like
 
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
to hear what the others think is that i'
 
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to avoid doing that because I
 
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
think if somebody's
 
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
already a Survivor and you know has
 
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
already been through a lot they should
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
be able to have the choice we shouldn't
 
00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 align:start position:0%
be you know they've already been kind of
 
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
controlled enough to speak this is both
 
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
parties have to agree to it so if they
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
don't want to agree to it they don't
 
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
have to do it um and I know particularly
 
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
I've heard concerns
 
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
um about litigation abuse and the amount
 
00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
of money that has been spent trying to
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
fight these things and
 
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're at a last resort like
 
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 align:start position:0%
can we agree to something because if not
 
00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 align:start position:0%
I'm ready to drop everything because I
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
just I can't afford an attorney every
 
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
more and I know I know the Coalition
 
00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
does the best that they can and some
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys will volunteer for some of the
 
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
stuff but the reality of the situation
 
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
is of course the attorneys have to feed
 
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
their families too and they can't take
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
on every case for free that they would
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
like so sometimes when these cases go on
 
00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:11.870 align:start position:0%
like so sometimes when these cases go on
and

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
on I mean there's there's not much that
 
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
they can do so I feel like it should be
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
an option available I don't want to tie
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
the hands that you can't have this tool
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to hear your thoughts if
 
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
you'd be okay with adding in some
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
training but not completely excluding
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
and saying that
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
if there's domestic violence you can't
 
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.990 align:start position:0%
if there's domestic violence you can't
do

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
this yep I don't know how freely uh you
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
want us to talk or how formal um so the
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
that reminded me when you were talking
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
about that the one of the other things
 
00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
that we're um hearing about is of course
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's these are in high conflict cases
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about Aon agreement
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
which normally in high conflict that
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
they're not um in agreement on pretty
 
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
much anything which isn't always the
 
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
case in DV cases I mean in DV cases
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
sometimes they'll agree to it because
 
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
they think they can yeah I mean a lot of
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
times they think they're right there's
 
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
not a lot of insight into whether or not
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
there is DV which is why it's important
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
to have somebody else come in and say
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is this is not healthy uh
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
relationship um
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
experiences so I don't know you know is
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
this a wording that you've seen in other
 
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
states that that's working on I mean or
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
the upon agreement in the high conflict
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
or this is just something that we
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
decided to
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
try so there are a few states that are
 
00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 align:start position:0%
using a pawn agreement there are some
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
states that are just ordering it and it
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to be a pawn
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
agreement okay but I was trying to make
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
it I think at least to start I think it
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
would be nice if parties agree upon it
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
and they're doing so willfully and free
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
freely and I think some of the other
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
states that are ordering it also have
 
00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
much more subsidies available that
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're able to just fully pay for it um
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
and I have
 
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
mixed feelings about potentially
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
ordering something that you're going to
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
make somebody pay for I just don't I
 
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's right to say oh you
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
have to do this and then you have to pay
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
for it I think you know it's kind of a
 
00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:13.879 align:start position:0%
different step if you're going to say do
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
you want to do this do you want to pay
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
for this and the both parties can agree
 
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
and go into it so it's and I also don't
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
want it to be an effort in futility
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
right if if the parties are like nope
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no way we're going to
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
agree on anything we don't want to do
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
this what's the point right but if the
 
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
parties are like you know what we've
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
gone through all of this neither one of
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
us are getting what we want um we'd like
 
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
to just sit down and see if perhaps we
 
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
can't agree to something and I think you
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
know having this background of more you
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
know psychology social worker maybe they
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
can get the parties to agree on
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
something that makes
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
sense yeah I I I think the um I think
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
not being an attorney is helpful not NE
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't don't necessarily have to be an
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
attorney um I think any training uh and
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
DV would would be helpful I mean I don't
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
know what hourly training they have now
 
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
is it two three hours is it 24 hours is
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
it 40 hours I mean the minimum the
 
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.909 align:start position:0%
it 40 hours I mean the minimum the
better

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I know I know uh the court said that
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
um these coordinators are very helpful
 
00:08:29.469 --> 00:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
uh when the parents agree to them um if
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
we man if we mandate it um then the
 
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
court needs the money to pay for it um
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
so I I agree that it ought to be first
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
it ought to be um both
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
parties um
 
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
agreeing um and I mean keep uh keep a
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
log of that so that another year we
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
could take a look at it and see if it'
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to uh have the card pay
 
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.190 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to uh have the card pay
for

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.750 align:start position:0%
for
it

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
yeah let me take a minute to just look
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
through and just see I did we did get
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
um trying to why can't I her name is
 
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
blanking me a committee researcher
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
regarding parenting coordinators and
 
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
other I was going to just kind quickly
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
go through and see the number of
 
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.750 align:start position:0%
go through and see the number of
hours

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
um do you guys Dyer yeah it was
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
Christina Dyer so I think we have that
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.120 --> 00:13:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to come back in
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay go
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
ahead so we've already had to have the
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
parents have to agree or whatever and
 
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
they have that time to take that away
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
like that whether or not they agree on
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
the parent yeah seven days coordinator
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
but then when you go on the second page
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
to line
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
four that they they'll file a report so
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
the Partington coordinators have this
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
report but it has to be agreed on by
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
each party before they turn it in in a
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
DV case or other cases that's never NE
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
both parties are never going to agree so
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
unless it comes out unless it comes out
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
amicable to both people which I can't
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
ever imagine happening in a high
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
conflict so I think once I mean if we
 
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
have a parenting coordinator once it's
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
been agreed upon that the parent
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator of who that's
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
going to be it only makes sense that
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
whatever the parenting coordinator that
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
was agreed upon has their report that
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
should go into the judge period like
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
that's why why would we make the parties
 
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:06.759 align:start position:0%
agree to that so some feedback that I
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
got from several of the family law
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys that was that
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
basically if I'm going to agree for my
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
client to go to this and speak freely I
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
would only do that if the report has to
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
be agreed upon by both parties otherwise
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going with my client and my client's
 
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:24.519 align:start position:0%
not going to be speaking freely there
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
because I don't want a report to come
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
out that's going to potentially make my
 
00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
client look bad and so if you want the
 
00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:32.759 align:start position:0%
parties to actually go in in good faith
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
to decide on
 
00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:36.519 align:start position:0%
something that was a suggestion that I
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
got from several of them what do I mean
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
this otherwise they were like there's no
 
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.790 align:start position:0%
this otherwise they were like there's no
way

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
because yeah it'll be the same thing as
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
like a gal in the sense that the gal
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
just gets to say whatever they want to
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
say and the parties don't get to agree
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
on it or not and so he's like people
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
will just either never agree to use this
 
00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
or they're going to go in with their
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys and it'll be a waste of
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
time so the parties even if they don't
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
don't agree to the
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
report uh they would still be
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
responsible to pay even though there's
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
nothing coming
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
forward um absent the agreement by both
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
parties the parent Corner shall not
 
00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
testify nor produce
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
records correct so but each party would
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
be paying for half of it so you would
 
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
think that the parties aren't going to
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
be going into this in the sense of oh
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm going to go in here and just
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
waste time because they both would have
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
a financial interest in not wasting the
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
time um I would say that it does say in
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
here the the one caveat in here is that
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
the parenting coordinator May recommend
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
that one party pay all or more than half
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
based on a part on a party's failure to
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
work in good faith with the parenting
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
coordinator or the other party or for
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
other good cause and that is very
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
explicitly says may recommend because
 
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
it's up to the judge to ultimately
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
decide what the judge wants to do but
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
that is the one kind of thing that's in
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
here if a party does go into it in bad
 
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
faith and they're truly not trying to to
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
make it work that the other person's not
 
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
going to get stuck with half a bill for
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
nothing um and so that was kind of the
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
piece that was put in there to try and
 
00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:13.389 align:start position:0%
piece that was put in there to try and
make

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
it you know we're going to make sure
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
that we're not just wasting time or
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
money in this because if you are doing
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
that then you're going to be stuck with
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
the one wasting the money so the the um
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
the reason for the parenting coordinator
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
is for the parent correct correct so the
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
judge does it help the judge to know
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
who's cooperating and who
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
isn't I mean that that that would be
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
another um you know I mean I think that
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
the judge would know if the parenting
 
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
coordinator was recommending that this
 
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
party is not acting in good faith that's
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
kind of the only caveat is that this
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
parent is not acting in good faith so
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
I'm recommending that the other person
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
pay like that's kind of The Only
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
Exception there I do know that there was
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
one other thing pointed out during the
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
test testimony that somebody had had
 
00:17:00.839 --> 00:17:04.189 align:start position:0%
test testimony that somebody had had
asked

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:06.919 align:start position:0%
um if a party objects to the appointment
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
the court shall appoint a different
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
person or confirm the appointment within
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
seven days and so
 
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
um that one they just wanted to get rid
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
of or confirm the appointment um just so
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
that it's it is agreed upon and that
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
they're not going to appoint somebody if
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
somebody is objecting so that was one
 
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
other thing that's on line
 
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.870 align:start position:0%
other thing that's on line
26

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
26
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah in terms of the filing of the
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
report that was like a sticking point
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
that I did get back from several of of
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
the family law attorneys so I don't know
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
so what what would
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
um what would be the case if or is it
 
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
even possible for the uh for the judge
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
to get the
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
report and he can't weigh in on it well
 
00:17:58.149 --> 00:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
I guess that would be uh well the that
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
the judge would get the report and it
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't and it
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh and if the parties don't
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
doc I mean somebody's got to I mean
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
people are paying for this
 
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.149 align:start position:0%
people are paying for this
thing

00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
um right but you're the same concept of
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
you're going before a mediator and if
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
you're not agreeing in mediation then
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
nothing goes before the judge there
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
I think it's just another tool to have
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
available and it's the same thing in
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
mediation if the parties don't agree in
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
mediation then nothing goes before the
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
judge yeah but I'm thinking in
 
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.549 align:start position:0%
judge yeah but I'm thinking in
conflicts

00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
conflicts
 
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
um this is the suck and bite at the
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
Apple no way you're going to get to you
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
know no way first going to get him to
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
agree to use somebody secondly get them
 
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.750 align:start position:0%
agree to use somebody secondly get them
to

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
agree to the
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
report I mean the report's going to show
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
one of them in a bad
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
light little or a lot so the point isn't
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
really supposed to be to be showing a
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
party in the bad light or not it's kind
 
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
of just to get the parties to agree on
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
what might work out right like we've got
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
a judge here that doesn't know what the
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
parents schedules are they don't know
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
that Susie has gymnastics uh on Mondays
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
and that Michael has hockey on Thursdays
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
and that you know dad works until this
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
time and mom works until that time the
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
parties all know that the parties all
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
know who typically takes each child to
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
what not and what schedule would
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
actually work best for their family
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
right rather than a judge blindly just
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
ordering and saying well on Mondays and
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays the kids go on with Mom
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays and Thursday the kids go with
 
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
Dad and every other weekend we swap back
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
and forth between the parents I I really
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
think that if the parties got to have
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
some weigh in and give some you know hey
 
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:51.559 align:start position:0%
this would work best for us based on our
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
family so I'm not I think it is a tool
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
I think if if we saw like how it was
 
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:05.559 align:start position:0%
working and that there was you know more
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
to be changed with it at some point if
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
we thought we wanted to have you know a
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
different path
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
where potentially it it's court ordered
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
and the parties aren't agreeing I think
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
that's something different to look into
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
but for now I think it's nice to start
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
it off with it all being elective
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
and the part's agreeing or not if they
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
go for an if they go and they sit down
 
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
for an hour and they spend $150 and
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
neither of them agree you know what it's
 
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
less than the cost that they're paying
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
for that they're each paying an attorney
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
fees you know for an hour of attorney
 
00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
fees so if they go and they sit and it's
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
just not working then they can end it so
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
currently they were assigned by the
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
judge what's assigned by the judge uh
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
the parenting
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
coordinator uh currently they say
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
currently no the the parties have to
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
agree currently they're really not using
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinators I guess there's
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
one in nsha that kind of does it
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
privately but it's not okay so it's not
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
like through the court and there's no
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
court ordering around it okay all right
 
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
because my understanding the testimony
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
was that it was very successful so that
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
was through not used enough yeah so that
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
was through the the one private that was
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
through the one private place that's
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
kind of doing it in nsha but I don't
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
think that it's really very widespread
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
and that was more of a the parties did
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
it on their own but the judge hadn't you
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
know been involved with the ordering of
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh and and then and seven you got the uh
 
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
immunity statement that's going to be
 
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.909 align:start position:0%
immunity statement that's going to be
another

00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh I I I absolutely agree with it uh but
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to be uh I mean that's what
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
we're hearing in these Family Court
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
matters is judges immunity attorneys
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
immunity uh I mean I don't think's
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
immunity I don't think without any sort
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
of immunity in here that you're going to
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
get anybody to ever take the J and I
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
mean I think unless the Omission causing
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
the injury was willful or wanton I mean
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's you know if you're doing
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
something that's kind of outside of the
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
scope of your duties or you're willfully
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
doing something then you're liable for
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
it but okay I think if you've got two
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
parties that just aren't agreeing
 
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
um are we going to accuse the parenting
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
coordinator that it's their fault you
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
know we're bringing rasing a
 
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
professional to get involved in kind of
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
an already high conflict situation and I
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
don't think they want to go through
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
litigation with somebody either you know
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh should we also have in here the
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
data what we're looking for in data that
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
they will keep records
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
on you know so that a year from now well
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
actually uh in
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
26 we we could look at the data to
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
see um you know 40% of the time the
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
parents agreed to both the coordinator
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
and the um and the
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
report okay
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
up hello again hi good morning thank you
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
for coming um so regarding the
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
collection of the data would that be
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
something that would be the court would
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
easily be able to do in terms of
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
collecting the data um for if you know
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
how often parties were agreeing to use a
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator and how often that
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
the court was getting a
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
report um the short answer is it's it's
 
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
not a part of our current case software
 
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
which as you know is is very frustrating
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
for legislators because it is um it
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
tracks case numbers party names dates
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
but but not really any kind of
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
information um so it would have to be
 
00:23:58.269 --> 00:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
something that we'd have to to send out
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
a directive basically to every Court to
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
have the clerks specifically noting it
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
reporting it back um to the AOC and then
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
collecting it there um and then giving
 
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
it to the legislature which is something
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
we we can do it's just a certain number
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
of Staff hours that are not currently
 
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
committed to that
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
purpose now would that be a big effort
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
or do you think that that would be
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
something that could easily be absorbed
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
into the current workload of
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
staff I think generally we did have hire
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
a new uh data and statistics person and
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
we're trying to kind of get better data
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
and statistics for parties that are
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
interested including the legislature but
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
others are interested as well um and and
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
typically there's the the front-end
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
collection um which is a certain number
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
of uh Staffing hours but then we' want
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
them audited by someone who's a data
 
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
expert after to make sure that it is not
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
bad data I mean the biggest challenge we
 
00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
face is inconsistent application of our
 
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
data requests so we we may train all the
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
different clerks and say we want this
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
data but um they have different ideas of
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
what's collectible what's success or
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
they neglect to do it because there's no
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
business purpose to doing it and they
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
forget so we'd have a person kind of go
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
back over it and and check that the the
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
quality of the data is good so I don't
 
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
want to represent that it's not some man
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
hours I can certainly check with our
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
budget folks if we get a a fiscal
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
request on that or it goes to finance
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
and and those numbers are needed but
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
there would be a certain number of
 
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
involved I don't think it would NE
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
necessitate hiring new staff it would
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
just be letting you know how many hours
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
that takes
 
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
up so so uh I mean just I I I understand
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
giving this a a try uh I mean I'm I'm
 
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
um uh to agree to this under that you
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
know under that belief um but I mean I I
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
I would just be looking
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
for how many how many more cases um
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
agreed to a parenting coordinator both
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
um agreeing to the coordinator within
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
seven days and agreeing to the report
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
and those that didn't agree with the
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
report and that would I mean
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
they other data would be good but not
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
necessary you know as to why there
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't an agreement
 
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
or um you know
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
just I'd like to know that parenting
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
coordinators have increased
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
substantially in in those cases and uh
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
that they you know I'd be interested to
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
see the percentage of parties that agree
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
report and to start to me that would be
 
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
I mean if it's 30% I'm happy yeah so I
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
guess for those two data points you know
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
for for first how many agree to to using
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
the coordinator and then second for how
 
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
many agreed to their report would that
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
be something that you guys
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
could do on your own by Court rule or
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
would that be something that we would
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
need to put in here legislatively as a
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
mandate I think it's generally helpful
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
for a data collection to have it in in
 
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
legislative language we we can always do
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
things on our side and we do you know we
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time getting um different
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
types of information that we see are
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
repeatedly of Interest either to private
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
citizens the media or the legislature we
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
we often do do that ourselves but I
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
think it's unhelpful because um as as
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
director Reay of the FBI says many
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
people want the FBI to do more but very
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
few want it to do less um so we have a
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
lot of conversations with folks that
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
they want more or more data or more
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
services from the courts and it's
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
helpful to quantify it so that even
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
though this may not require hiring a new
 
00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
staff or if 15 bills pass a legislature
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
this term in the aggregate that might
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
require a certain number of staff to be
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
added to the court yeah the only reason
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm asking more so is that once we
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
put this in here then you guys are going
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
to be kind of having to collect that
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
forever until it's changed versus if you
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
agreed to do it on your own and we were
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
like okay we've collected the data for
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
two years we're happy with the numbers
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
we don't need the numbers anymore then
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
you guys aren't having to give us
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
numbers that we don't care about anymore
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
waiting for somebody to agree to take it
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
off the table I guess that's my that's a
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
good point I think you know a
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
conversation about things that the
 
00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
legislature finds helpful can be just as
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
effective as getting it in mandatory
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
language and we can just as easily
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
present the aggregate of all those
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
requests when we do our annual budget
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
um and say you know here are all the
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
things we've been asked to do and and
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
this is how much it'll cost so I take
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
your point I think either way you know
 
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
In fairness we can we can have a
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
conversation about it or it's something
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
that you certainly can put in
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
legislative language okay and then
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
relative to training for domestic
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
violence is there any training available
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
through the court for mediators or or
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys that the that the court um
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
either puts on or is is put on by
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
another organization but that the court
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
knows of that these parenting
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
coordinators could
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
potentially take part in that we could
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
kind of put that in there if you know of
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
one do you know approximately how many
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
hours it is I don't I do know that the
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
guardian Ed Lim board um generally when
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
they're certifying Guardians Ed lium
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
they they either take someone with an
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
Associate Degree with a th000 hours of
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
relevant experience someone with a
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree with 600 hours of
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
experience or someone with an advanced
 
00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:21.799 align:start position:0%
degree with 200 hours of experience and
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
they have some training programs that
 
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
they recommend um because we don't we
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
don't typically
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
um administrator the training oursel um
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
so they may have a little bit more
 
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
information on some of the options
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
because certainly that's something that
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
they deal with a
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
lot okay thank you let me I'll
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'll uh so when uh when the judges pick
 
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.830 align:start position:0%
I'll uh so when uh when the judges pick
in

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
gal's and it's a domestic violence uh
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
issue will they look for somebody with
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
that experience I think if you I I think
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
so and and you'd look for someone
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
experience experienced if it's in
 
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
training or experienced a lot of
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
experiences a gal um you know the more
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
challenging the case the more you want
 
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
someone who's really demonstrated a lot
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
of proficiency as a GAO and if it's an
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
easier case where it's just helpful to
 
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
have a g between two parties then then
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
maybe you would take someone who's a
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
little bit less experienced but for
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
something like that I think you would
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
want someone very experienced okay okay
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
so was your thought process there that
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't have to mandate the
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
training that the court could look for
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
somebody with the TR like
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
I yeah I'm I'm not sure if a judge may
 
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
want a parenting coordinator uh with a
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
with I don't know if they have domestic
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
violence training uh or experience even
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
because they're not attorneys they're
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
psychologists or what have you um so I
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
don't know if adding the training is is
 
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
good I mean we would have to determine
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
what training's out there and what are
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
we requiring them
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.789 align:start position:0%
we requiring them
to

00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.789 --> 00:31:03.799 align:start position:0%
Point yeah because I would think like a
 
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519 align:start position:0%
gal the court I mean I would think like
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
based on some of this already like if
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
um if you're
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
already um holding a New Hampshire
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
license in your area of practice such as
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
you know say psychology or social work
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
that you likely through that would
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
have some sort of DV training like I
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
would think if you're a
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
family therapist you would have DV
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
training but I mean can I say for sure
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
do well no but I think to your point is
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
a judge going to look to the ones that
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
they know are experienced in that area
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
so line
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
16 participate in 24-hour training I'm
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
not not sure if any of these trainings
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
include that they
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
may I mean I guess you know we could put
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
into we could put into part of this part
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
D that we would also say
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
um and domestic
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
work all right so if we add into line 18
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence part into that
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
training and then we remove from line 26
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
or confirm the
 
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.590 align:start position:0%
or confirm the
appointment

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you attorney krian much
 
00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:46.039 align:start position:0%
appreciated um and then the court is
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
able to get us the data on their own
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
um would you guys
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
be supportive of this or do you think
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
that there's anything else that we need
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
to look into changing what's your
 
00:32:59.950 --> 00:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable which one were you looking
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
at um 26 yeah 26 so if a party objects
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
to the appointment the court shall
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
appoint a different person or confirm
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
the appointment within seven days so it
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
was asked during the hearing to the just
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
to delete the or confirm the appointment
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
that way they're not confirming somebody
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
that the parties have objected to okay
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
okay y yes R Greg thank you so I you
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
know what I think that that's good I'm
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
I'm really hung up on that section six
 
00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
now because I think about when I think
 
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
about what we're doing in the high
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
conflict cases so just trying to figure
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
out because our schedules are weird and
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
that's not high conflict the kind that
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of like the high conflict
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
where we have to go to another party and
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
say you know either help mitigate this
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
or what are the complicating factors
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
that are getting this high conflict um
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
and I do have experience in a number of
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
high conflict
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
cases the biggest thing is is is there's
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
generally some it's not necessarily
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence abuse right but there
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
is some sort of abuse whether it be
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
through you know a power trip of
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
somebody wanting to just have control
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
over everything um but there is you know
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
and it could be both parties you know
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
kind of having that same control so I'm
 
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
looking at this particular paragraph and
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
thinking even though we've helped them
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know and we have somebody that maybe
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
has the the DV and you know all this
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
other stuff once we get to this that
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter because this I see this
 
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
more as a weapon now to like okay let's
 
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
see if we can push this through and then
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
when it gets this point I can say no I I
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
mean I understand the want for a
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
disclaimer but that's just not the type
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
you know of help that we want to get
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
because it's it's just so complicated
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
and this is this would be more
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
weaponized also if we're letting them
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
use you know um from the mediation and
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
arbitration fund which is super helpful
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases but say there's
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that can get that that can get
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
the arbitration
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
fund what happens when they decide okay
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
I don't want to use that like I'm going
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
to see because I don't have to pay for
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
this I can get this arbitration fund and
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
now I can say no I mean I see this more
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
as like a a way out for a party that's
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
not necessarily working in the best
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
interest of everyone or certainly the
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
children that's my and and full
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
disclosure I mean I'm on I'm a
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill um but the more
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
I look at this and the more I think
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
about it I just think about how many
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
cases that we really need this
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
process so I'm happy to discuss changing
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
it but in full disclosure every attorney
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
I spoke to said that they either they
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
would likely recommend that their
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
clients did not participate in this at
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
all or if they did they would go with
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
their client and it would be mute so I'm
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
not sure like that I I just don't know
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
if it would ever be agreed upon to be
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
used if we changed that part that's my
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
concern true and that's frustrating by
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
the way I mean that's that's a
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
frustrating thing that you know if we're
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get the parents and by the way
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
if they can then afford attorneys
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
they're probably not using the
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
arbitration fund exactly but
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and the arbitration fun it I doubt
 
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
that it's actually going to end up being
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
used it was just put in there as an
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
option if the court wants to use it if
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
the court sees like hey these
 
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
parties both of them are prosay I think
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
they could really benefit from this we
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
just we want to use it then they then
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
they could consider using it but it's
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
not any type of a mandate it says that
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
the court May um and to be fair like I
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
did ask a dozen attorneys about this and
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
they all said the same thing so I
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't find one that said oh yeah I'd
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
be fine with that they were all like
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
nope no way okay well that's where the
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
data will be super important then to see
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
like how many people are I would also be
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
interested in how many people are going
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
through this process and then saying no
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have the report sent
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
in because that's a that's a big deal
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and if that I mean if that comes
 
00:36:59.950 --> 00:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
out and happens then we we can repeal it
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
if it's just being used as a weapon then
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
that's certainly not helpful to anybody
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
for them to go through the whole process
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
and then it's all for nothing you know
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so so in testimony my my perception
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
was that these parenting coordinators
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
were very helpful even though there were
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
few uh and it just made sense to me uh
 
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm willing to risk agree
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
in with this because we don't know you
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
know we could we could think that'll add
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
more conflict I don't know um I I mean
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
it's another level where the conflicted
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
party would have to go through um which
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes I think when you put stuff in
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
their face they're like yeah I'm being a
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
little unreasonable right um so yeah I'd
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
be I'd be willing to do this you know in
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
you know after a year um get the data to
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
see where it's all going it may not you
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
know you know it may not go where we're
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
thinking it's going and and and I know
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
this par coordinator is an
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
advantage you know I want to I want to
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
try it you know how do you feel are you
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that even with the
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
report thing in there and we can come
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
back to it if if we see that it's
 
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
causing a problem ba based on that I
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
mean I feel better about that I
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
definitely just would be
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
interested you know in that in that data
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
on that but I overall I think this needs
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
to happen I just want to make sure that
 
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing it you know it's one
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
of those things you you try to prevent
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
that um that all that stuff that you're
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
going to learn in hindsight um so just
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
trying to think about every Avenue but
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
overall I think the one thing that we
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
have heard over and over is the
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
importance of you know something like
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
the gal system that really I I feel like
 
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
is kind of you know a little bit of
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
water on a a grease fire um but I think
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
the parenting coordinator opening it up
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
and having the DV training and doing all
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
this especially if we can work with the
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
courts with the data and stuff I mean
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to have the same impulse I
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
did you know and and wellth thought out
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
impulse though that I I think this is
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
important I would agree to that so yeah
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
so so when is the uh coordinator
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
paid after it delivers a report once the
 
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.990 align:start position:0%
paid after it delivers a report once the
parties

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
confirm um once the part's confirmed so
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
the parties would agree and may be
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
paying the
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
coordinator once the report was done
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
however they still would have to decide
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
whether they want the report they accept
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
the report typically these types of
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
people would have to be paid like
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
Upfront for their services like when you
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
go to the doctor's office and you pay
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
your co-pay or if you have no insurance
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
you pay the full cost of the of the
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
visit UPF front um yeah so it's usually
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
upfront so that they're not I chasing
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
the parties around to to get the to get
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
the money I have the same issue that uh
 
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative Craig had with the
 
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
arbitration fund mediation fund you know
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
used um I qualify for that I don't have
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
to accept the report I'm
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
golden you know I and that's why I think
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's important that all this
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
language is enabling and it does say May
 
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
the court May appoint a GU you know a a
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator um the court may
 
00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:27.470 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinator um the court may
use

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
so I think these things are all really
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
very discretional and if there was I
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
would think these would be like the for
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
the for the fund to be used that would
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
probably be more like a very special
 
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.309 align:start position:0%
probably be more like a very special
case

00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
scenario um and not like a typical thing
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
I know that they have a limited
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
arbitration fund anyway so I
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
don't know that it would be used very
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
often but there may be circumstances
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
where you know a judge is like I I
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
actually think these parties could come
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
together and maybe agree on something
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
they just need the right person to help
 
00:40:58.359 --> 00:41:00.030 align:start position:0%
they just need the right person to help
them

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.750 align:start position:0%
them
um

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and I would think that the
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh the parenting coordinator's time is
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
more prior to the report than after the
 
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
report correct right
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
okay so are there any other changes that
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
you guys would like to see in here or
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
are you okay with those two in your are
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
okay y okay all right I will send this
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
to OS now and then um regard regarding
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee where do we
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
the G portion of things do we think that
 
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that we want to keep
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
kind of looking into do we think we want
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
to see maybe where this goes and then
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
reassess the g g portion in a year after
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen like maybe this parenting
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
coordinator can kind of play a bigger
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
role what are your
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh did did we have a g bill we
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
don't have a g like specific Bill
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh yeah because I know uh the
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
G's are currently enabled they can
 
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
currently be used they're just it seems
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
like they're not being used very much
 
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.790 align:start position:0%
like they're not being used very much
due

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
to kind of a lack of agreement with them
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
and there's no funding for them so the
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
parties have to pay for them and the
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
parties mostly aren't wanting to use
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
them although I think we weren't able to
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily get specific data regarding
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
how many were using them but it's from
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
asking this the judges kind of to try
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
and get that anecdotal data it was not
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
they were not very used right
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
now but um and I think kind of some of
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
the feedback we got from that was that a
 
00:42:43.549 --> 00:42:43.559 align:start position:0%
lot of the G's right now were more
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer based and not necessarily coming
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
from this you know psychology social
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
background work where they may be able
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
to kind of help the parties to agree
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
more rather than discuss
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
like you know the legal aspect you know
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
figure out the legal aspect of things um
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
do you think do you think attorney for a
 
00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.790 align:start position:0%
do you think do you think attorney for a
child

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
specific may be helpful with the G
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
issues so is that another bill that
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
there was another bill that went they
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
already uh it already passed yeah okay
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
so do we want to see where the that bill
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
and this bill go and then maybe look at
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
it we recommend that you know it
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
potentially be looked at after we've
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
seen how both of these go for a little
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
bit yeah okay okay all right yes Qui I I
 
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
think one of the biggest things that you
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
know we noticed even with the the gal is
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
that you know and I wish it's that whole
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
data thing right it's like the Achilles
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
heel I wish we knew how many families
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
would take advantage of it that it would
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
help like you know when we sat in on the
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
court cases we had a couple families
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
that wanted it but they couldn't afford
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
it you know and and knowing like how
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
many people were missing out especially
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
once we go into a budget year again you
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
know we're not in that kind of budget
 
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
year and so then that then we start have
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
to talking about next term and who's you
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
know going to be here and who's not uh
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
to look at you know funding that again I
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
think that was a great disservice that
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately happened within our state
 
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
when we didn't no longer funded that
 
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
program but besides that I think this
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then that having the attorney um for
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
Miners and stuff I think that these two
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
are steps in the right direction I think
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
the next big step would be getting that
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
funded again and I just I that's not
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
going to happen this year so okay anyway
 
00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:28.109 align:start position:0%
going to happen this year so okay anyway
thank

00:44:28.109 --> 00:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
you is there anything you wanted to add
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
you not to put you on the spot I totally
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
am putting you on the spot I this may be
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
the last subcommittee that we have on
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
this if we're kind of agreeing to and I
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't want them to end so I'm
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
prolonging the the meeting um no thank
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
you very much uh there's there are a few
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
things I hear more consistently from
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
judges then it would be great to have a
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
gal fund again um um they rarely want to
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
weigh in on policy they rarely want to
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
say anything but I think they have the
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
experience that you observed which is
 
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
people come in and they would love to
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
have them and they just can't pay for
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
them and there's that it's it's it's
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that there are so many
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
people I know it's it's frustrating that
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're not trkking it but you
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
observed it all the judges observe it um
 
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate your attention to
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
that issue because I think it it is
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
something that would really make a
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
difference okay so then that that could
 
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
be something that we put in our report
 
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
to to make sure that we're looking into
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
for next year when we're going to
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
actually have a budget year that might
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
be a good time to kind of look into that
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
meantime if there was a
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
way to ask even just a few of the judges
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
like how to kind of how often would you
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
how often would this be helpful like
 
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
especially the judges that you're
 
00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:50.839 align:start position:0%
hearing hey it would be great to have
 
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
this funded um if there's like a
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
specific Court location that maybe
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't have a lot of judges and
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
one judge would be happy to just keep a
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
tally sheet hey I would have used it in
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
these cases like just getting some data
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
on it I think would really be helpful
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
because that obviously was a fund that
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
was quite a bit of money so in order to
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
get that money I think people are going
 
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.309 align:start position:0%
get that money I think people are going
to

00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
want some data rather than just a few
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
judges said this would be great you know
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
I think that would go that would go much
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
further and certainly that's not a
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
mandate that's just a recommendation
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
that if the court wanted to give that
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
data that may be helpful with with
 
00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.079 align:start position:0%
getting that funded again again that's a
 
00:46:28.589 --> 00:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
that's a helpful observation and since
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
we do have this new data person let me
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
see if we can do like a sampling like
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
maybe we go to our most populous courts
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
and as opposed to having every Court uh
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
and see if there's something that we can
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
do that instead of it's everyone it's a
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
sampling measure maybe um so let me look
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
into that than thank you for that that
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful just uh um I I
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
know there's not clear data on this but
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
somehow just keeping in the back of your
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
mind How would any of these
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
initiatives help in setting dockets you
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
know uh budgeting time for the courts um
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know I'm thinking this may help um
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
how much I don't know um so just you
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't have to
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
be on paper you know a report on paper
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
just you know whether judge Ashley or
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
judge king will come before us and
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
saying you know we believe we saved x
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
amount of hours um so thank you by using
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
um parenting coordinators by using
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
parenting coordinators
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
y my hope would be that if we have
 
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.990 align:start position:0%
y my hope would be that if we have
something

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
more uh universally able to be used like
 
00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
something like the gal or where we're
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
helping provide that actually helps in
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
costs on our courts you know that you
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
know that that can help not only with
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
the costs in the courts but also um
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
expediency and um making sure that we're
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
utilizing uh the courts to the best of
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
the ability and not just prolonging
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
things for a long time that would be
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
that would be my Hope on that that we'd
 
00:48:02.109 --> 00:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
probably save in one area by bringing up
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
another perfect does anybody have
 
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
anything they wanted to
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
add thank you all for all of your help
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
and work it's much appreciated all right
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
then I will close the hearing and um I
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
will put in a draft of the things that
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
we spoke about into language and then we
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
can vote on that as a full committee
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
you
