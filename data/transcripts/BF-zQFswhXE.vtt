00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is in regards to determining
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
the average final
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
compensation for the new hampshire group
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
2 retirement system
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.230 align:start position:0%
 
currently

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
the average final
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
compensation we'll call afc
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
is used as part of the calculation to
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
determine the annual pension members of
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
the retirement system receive
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
for those who retired
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
for those who were hired on or after
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
july 1st
 
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.670 align:start position:0%
july 1st
2011

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
2011
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
or have not attended
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
vested status prior to january 1st
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
2012 the afc is
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
calculated by determining the average of
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
your highest five years base salary and
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
adding your career average compensation
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
over the basin excluding your highest
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
what this legislation is attempting to
 
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.830 align:start position:0%
what this legislation is attempting to
do

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
is adjust the afc calculation for group
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
two to consider compensation
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
over base in the members highest five
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
years when averaging the member's entire
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
career of compensation over base a
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
members conversation over base is their
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
highest five years
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
in their highest five years will still
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
be compared to their compensation over
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
their entire career
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
but this legislation would ensure that
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
their entire career would be considered
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
as part of that calculation
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
because now five years isn't
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is all about fairness and this
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill is very timely
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
when the last big changes to group two
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
average final compensation was completed
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
it excluded the highest five years for
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
calculating the afc
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
for people under 10 years at that time
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
this subset of group two people are
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
reaching their retirement age at this
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
time so it's really timely to uh take
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
care of this at this time
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
and i'll
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
start my discussion there because
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people here that are a
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
little bit better versed on this than i
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
am and on the financial end of it so
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
they awaken this waiting to speak
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay is this better
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay thanks um

so i'll again for the record marty
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
carlin representing nhrs who does not
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
have a position on the bill um i signed
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
up to testify to provide some background
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
average final compensation calculation
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
to help understand what this change is
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
about i prepared a handout which the
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
committee has and there were some copies
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
on the table for the gallery as well
 
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.190 align:start position:0%
on the table for the gallery as well
basically

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
the pension calculation is based on
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
um you know years of service and average
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
final compensation
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
average final and
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
to determine average final compensation
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's a there's something called
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation in the statute and
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
that lists a number of uh pay types
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
that count towards the pension formula
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
for people um base pay obviously things
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
like overtime holiday pay stipends um
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
longevity pay things like that so
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
up until 2012
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
you know all of that compensation as
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
long as it was considered pensionable
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
wages or double comp uh it was reported
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system in total you
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
know when contributions were assessed
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
for the member and the employer that way
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
with house bill 2 in 2011
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
beginning on january 1st of 2012
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
employers were required to report uh
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
base pay compensation over base pay
 
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
base pay compensation over base pay
um

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
um
separately

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
separately
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the the universe of
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
time where this has been in effect so
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
the last 11 years last 10 years
 
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.630 align:start position:0%
the last 11 years last 10 years
and

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
what the statute did at the same time
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
when it created this reporting was said
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
that for anybody who was not vested
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
prior to 1 one of 12 and that include
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
included future hires
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
when we go to calculate their average
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
final compensation their high five years
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know in their career
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
find the high five and then determine
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
the percentage of compensation over base
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
to base pay in the high five and so
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
you've got that percentage number you
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
put it over here and then we have to
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
look at the other years in their career
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
for which we have data on compensation
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
over base
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
and find the average in those years
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
outside the high five
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
and then the statute says we have to
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
apply the lower of those two percentages
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
to what we allow in the high five for
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
compensation over base so
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
clear is mud totally understand that um
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
there is a on the handout there's a
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
sample calculation
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
um you know just you know hypothetical
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
this is if someone had an average final
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
compensation of 60 000 in their high
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
five and 50 000 of that was base pay
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
and another so the remainder would have
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
been compensation over base
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
um ten thousand into fifty thousand is
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
twenty percent of the total afc
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
was um comp over base and then if you
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
the next uh brits at the bottom of the
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
first page
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
if the rest of the career percentage was
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
also 20 or greater it would not change
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
the afc for the high five because
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
the af the percentage within the high
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
five is lower
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
if it was less than that we'd have to
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
apply that percentage to that ten
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of compensation over
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
base and the high five and that could
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
reduce the pension uh proportionally uh
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
the afc that goes into the pension
 
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.030 align:start position:0%
the afc that goes into the pension
formula

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
what this and what this bill would do is
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
change that calculation as as
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
representative pratt said to take the
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
percentage within the high five
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
and the percentage within the entire
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
member's career including the high five
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know this provision was part of an
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill that made
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
significant changes on multiple levels
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
to the pension plan um so you know it it
 
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.430 align:start position:0%
to the pension plan um so you know it it
um

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know there was a lot of moving parts
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
um you know with the legislation that
 
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.470 align:start position:0%
um you know with the legislation that
year

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
um this was uh added i think as a senate
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
amendment um this this position and it
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
was it was billed as an anti-spiking uh
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
piece where that um if somebody only
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
worked additional earned additional pay
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
in their in their high five uh you know
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
there'd be um
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know a consequence in the afc
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
calculation to that um you know and
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
there wasn't to my notes or knowledge uh
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
recollection much discussion of the of
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
this issue with the the entirety versus
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
that um so so uh
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's been conversations
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
since then about that and this this
 
00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:44.470 align:start position:0%
since then about that and this this
legislation

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
is spurred by that um right now we have
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
about 5 900 active group 2 members who
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
fall into this
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
formula and anybody you know who joins
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
the system in group 2 subsequently is
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
with that i can try to answer any
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
questions about the calculations i hope
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
that was helpful background
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr carlin i have a question
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
you say that the data for compensation
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
over base is only available for 10 years
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes so that and presumably one's highest
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
five years would be in the last 10 years
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
of your career
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
typically but not always yeah okay so
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about one
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
on one hand and the rest of the career
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
is also five years
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the most case
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
yeah for you for
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know anybody who yeah there's there
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
are many people in the system who that's
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
a very small sample size for for both
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
right now yes
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
are the other questions representative
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
pearson uh just just for clarity on what
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
you asked the reason that you only have
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
10 years worth of data is because prior
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
to 10 years ago it was not separated
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
you're going to continue to carry that
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
data forward beyond 10 years
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
correct yes the employer has only
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
reported one line of compensation so
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
it's not like the system just keeps 10
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
years worth of data it's just that they
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
started collecting it 10 years ago
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me i i i phrased it badly you're
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
totally i agree with you and the other
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
question well that's that is it wasn't
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
even my question that was just to
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
to get some clarification
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
for you um my actual question is during
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
those highest five years
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
that are calculated does the employee
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
pay in to the system based on the
 
00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:31.829 align:start position:0%
pay in to the system based on the
earnings

00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
earnings
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
acquired during that period of time yeah
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
the employee pays in and you know in
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
real time every pay period or percentage
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
of their earnable compensation
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
as does the employer yeah
 
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.590 align:start position:0%
as does the employer yeah
follow-up

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
is the employee refunded that money when
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
those five years are
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
taken away from the calculation are they
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
refunded for the portion to which they
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
put in
 
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.389 align:start position:0%
put in
no

00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i have one more madam chair
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
when this when this law was enacted in
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
2011 or when this change was made in
 
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.549 align:start position:0%
2011 or when this change was made in
2011

00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
2011
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
did this
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
just just for one more point of
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
clarification for the committee did this
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
retroactively apply to active employees
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh it applied to anyone who was uh not
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
vested prior to one one of twelve so
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
there was you know you know nine point
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
nine years and eleven months of people
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
who were in
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh in the system that it did apply to
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.830 align:start position:0%
all right
seeing

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you mr carlin thank
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
my name is arthur beaudry
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
i am the president of the new hampshire
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
state permanent firefighters retirement
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
association and i'm here in favor of
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1587 fna
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
as presented
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
mr collin did a great job as far as
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
giving you the background of how this
 
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.230 align:start position:0%
giving you the background of how this
happened

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
but when you look at it the current
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
legislation really is um
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me pretty hard with the mask um
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
current legislation really contradicts
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
itself how can you have an average of
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's career when you're removing a
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
portion of that average
 
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.150 align:start position:0%
portion of that average
so

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
when when this took place um
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
the members really lost a lot of things
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
if you get promoted um or you have um
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
you get a career
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
change as far as in your employment that
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
affects all your all your salary also so
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times i know in police and
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
fire um you might get promoted you know
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
in your last five years and that should
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
be included
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
in in the calculations and um
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
when when when you they take a portion
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
of that away from you i had some uh data
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to find it before i got
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
called in but
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
i i will i will present it that you can
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
get a firefighter prior to
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
2012 work the exact same amount of hours
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
as somebody that worked after 2012
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
and and make
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
more money
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
a lot more money than that individual
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
even though they both contributed the
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
exact same amount of money into the
 
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.630 align:start position:0%
exact same amount of money into the
system

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
so again it's a it's a equity and
 
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
fairness issue
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
and this bill has been brought before
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
you on more than one occasion and it
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
seems like it was stopped in finance
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
but the savings when when they have a
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this the only savings
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
that the system is saving is on the
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
backs of the retire of the person
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
retiring the member because that member
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
should be actually getting that
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
portion of their salary that they're
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
they're being
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
neglected to to get because of this
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
change so again if you're going to go
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
with an average of a person's career it
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
an average of all the years of service
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
and i will take any questions
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr beaudry representative
 
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.310 align:start position:0%
thank you mr beaudry representative
lackas

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
lackas
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
if i understood you correctly you were
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
saying that um
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know if they got a raise near the
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
end that that
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
because it uh
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
was in that last five years it
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
it would not contribute to their
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh retirement benefits but as i read
 
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.149 align:start position:0%
uh retirement benefits but as i read
this

00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
the limitation which deals with you know
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
what period is things are averaged over
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
applies to
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
compensation above the base pay i assume
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
if somebody gets a raise they
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
are a promotion they get a raise
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding unless i'm
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
that that increase in in base pay would
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
contribute to the retirement is that not
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
correct it does but when you get
 
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.630 align:start position:0%
correct it does but when you get
promoted

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
promoted
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
your extra details um if you have um
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
you're mustering outpay that's all
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's all part of that salary of um of
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
your promotion
 
00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:19.510 align:start position:0%
your promotion
um

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
you'll be available for the subcommittee
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%

00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
get sick again but yes i will i will
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
participate if you can yes thank you
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative pierce thank you thank
 
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.750 align:start position:0%
representative pierce thank you thank
you

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
mr botery for coming here you are a
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary wealth of historical
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that to which is is the
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
question i ask
 
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.630 align:start position:0%
question i ask
um

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
i wasn't in the legislature when this
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
when this
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
repair this fix was presented in years
 
00:21:58.559 --> 00:21:59.909 align:start position:0%
repair this fix was presented in years
past

00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
and i've so i'm not overly familiar but
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that when this was
 
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
calculated years ago the fiscal note was
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
substantially different than it is now
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know what the fiscal
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
note was on this in in years past
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
i don't i know i know the number was
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
somewhat high but again it it it's
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how why it is so high
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
because really it's it's money that
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
should be paid to the employee um they
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
worked it as you stated the question uh
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh had brought forward you paid into the
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
system on this money um so again it's
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
like taxation without representation
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
you're paying into something but you're
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr baudery other questions
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you

i am testifying today in support of
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%

but also someone who has a profound
 
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.430 align:start position:0%
but also someone who has a profound
concern

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
over the future of public safety in new
 
00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:48.630 align:start position:0%
over the future of public safety in new
hampshire

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
a noble calling that was once highly
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
desirable is now suffering from an
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
epidemic like none it's ever seen
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
in the mid to late 2000s new hampshire's
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
firefighter state entrance exam
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as the candidate
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
physical agility test
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
was seeing well over 500 candidates
 
00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:07.510 align:start position:0%
was seeing well over 500 candidates
annually

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
annually
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
many of whom touted a brand new fire
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
science degree or a paramedic
 
00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:12.470 align:start position:0%
science degree or a paramedic
certificate

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
making them highly marketable to the
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
average fire department
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
in spite of this most struggled to find
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
a job in what was once a highly
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
competitive market
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
now the very same test yields
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
approximately 60 percent fewer
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
candidates leaving many fire departments
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
unable to hire enough qualified
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
applicants to fill their open positions
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
last april the number of candidates
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
reach an all-time low with a mere 39
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
candidates taking the quarterly tests
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
you may be left asking yourself what has
 
00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:46.630 align:start position:0%
you may be left asking yourself what has
changed

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
a poll of our members shows that the
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
erosion of their retirement benefit is
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
atop the list of reasons that they have
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
left their careers in public service
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
or are considering doing so
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
in 2011 the legislative legislature
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
voted to make monumental changes to the
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retirement system in an
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
attempt to correct years of under
 
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.950 align:start position:0%
attempt to correct years of under
funding

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
these changes negatively impacted the
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
retirement security of public employees
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire drastically changing
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
the lives of hundreds of firefighters
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
since that time recruitment numbers have
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
consistently trended downward and fire
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
chiefs are finding it extremely
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to retain qualified
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
firefighters that once saw their
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
pensions cut in half
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
we rely on our firefighters to show up
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
during the worst moments of our lives
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
they were there to combat the opioid
 
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.669 align:start position:0%
they were there to combat the opioid
crisis

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
they remain on the front lines
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
protecting our communities in the midst
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
of a global pandemic
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
and they continue to respond to
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
catastrophic events when the result is
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
often a diagnosis of cancer
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder or
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
those who continue to answer the call do
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
so with honor and grace they are aware
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the many inherent risks of this
 
00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
of the many inherent risks of this
profession

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
but facing the risk of being unable to
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
retire on a livable wage
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
is one that many are no longer willing
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
to take
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
firefighters are now beginning to weigh
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
the benefits of doing a job they love
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
versus the cost of doing so
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
it is clear that the changes to the
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system 10 years ago caused a
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
ripple effect through new hampshire's
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
fire service
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
creating a systemic problem that can
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
only be fixed with a systemic solution
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
adjusting the average final compensation
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
calculation does not provide an enticing
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
new benefit
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
but it simply restores a small piece of
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
what was taken from our first responders
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
and takes a step towards providing this
 
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.789 align:start position:0%
and takes a step towards providing this
solution

00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
currently firefighters pay 11.8 percent
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system on every single
 
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
dollar that they earn in order to fund
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
their own benefit
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
yet current law prevents their highest
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
five years of compensation over base
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
from being included in their pension
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
calculation altogether
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
this means that firefighters called on
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
to fill the void in new hampshire
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
are working longer hours
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
spending more time away from their
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
families and exposing themselves to
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
additional risks to protect the citizens
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
of this state
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
and as a thanks for their service
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
they're told that that work may actually
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
be excluded from their retirement uh
 
00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.870 align:start position:0%
be excluded from their retirement uh
calculation

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
by making this small change a member's
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
benefit will be a more honest
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
representation representation of their
 
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.909 align:start position:0%
representation representation of their
careers

00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
careers
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
firefighters affected by the sweeping
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
changes to the retirement system in 2011
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
are now becoming retirement eligible
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
and realizing that they cannot afford to
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
retire at all
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
this has created a narrative in new
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire that is uninviting and
 
00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:43.430 align:start position:0%
hampshire that is uninviting and
unsustainable

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
unsustainable
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
it is time to show your firefighters
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
that as much as you rely on them they
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
can rely on you and they're listening
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
now more than ever
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
please join the 800 citizens
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
of this great state that have signed on
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
and show firefighters that you're
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
listening to
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
i implore the members of this committee
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
to do what is right for new hampshire's
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
fire service and support hb 1587.

thank you madam chair and i'll entertain
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr reel are there questions
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair um you say that
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
currently right now
 
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.470 align:start position:0%
currently right now
uh

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
group two employees pay eleven point
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
something percent
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
but didn't used to be nine and three
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
quarter percent at one particular time
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that rise now is taken away also too
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
that was done one
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
changed about whatever and did it affect
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
the uh spendable income it was in 11.
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
as part of the changes in the complete
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
overhaul of the retirement system okay
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
and sir for the record too um
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
firefighters 11.8 contribution is the
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
highest of the public employees in new
 
00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:00.870 align:start position:0%
highest of the public employees in new
hampshire

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
i'm here representing chapter 24 of the
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
sca as the chapter president
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
i've worked for the new hampshire
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
department of corrections for the past
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
17 years
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
my first 14 years as an officer in the
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
i was already working for the state for
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
approximately seven years when the
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
retirement was changed it went from
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
being based on our three best years
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
along with a few other benefits
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
and they changed it to our best five
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
years as we were told minus some
 
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.549 align:start position:0%
years as we were told minus some
benefits

00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
based on calculations because
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
retirement's not actually based on our
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
five years
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
i personally stand to lose approximately
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
thirteen hundred dollars a month when i
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
retire in five years
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
the truth is that we were lied to we
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
weren't provided all the information
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
we can still go online we can still find
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
information that was provided to us ten
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
years ago that said five best years
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
now that some of us are starting to look
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
at retirement we've learned that we were
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
deceived throughout my career the state
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
has tried to balance the budget on our
 
00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:24.230 align:start position:0%
has tried to balance the budget on our
backs

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
backs
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
we are citizens of new hampshire and we
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't deserve being deceived and to
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
state employees we deserve better the
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
people in this room keep this state
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
running smoothly and safely
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
the state already suffers from
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
understaffing it's time to start making
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
smarter decisions to keep employees and
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
to attract new employees
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill will benefit the
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
state and its employees
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none

00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
story with you i'm a 41 year old i live
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
in exeter new hampshire with my wife and
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
three daughters i'm currently serving in
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
my 15th year as a professional
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
firefighter in the town of hampton i'm a
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
first generation firefighter in fact i
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
hadn't given much thought
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
to becoming a firefighter until
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
september 11 2001 on that day i was a 21
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
year old marine stationed in okinawa
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
japan i disappear i witnessed the
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
bravery displayed by many americans that
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
day and it made me realize that there
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
are men and women dedicated to a higher
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
calling in every community in america
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
and soon we would be needing more of
 
00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:57.029 align:start position:0%
and soon we would be needing more of
them

00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
when my time was up in the marines i
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
made the trip home to start my training
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
to become a firefighter
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
while i was doing that i worked in
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
private business for several years while
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
i took my fire and medical classes on
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
nights and weekends i declined an offer
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
for a management position with my
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
company with a nice salary and benefit
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
package to pursue my goal of serving the
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
public as a firefighter
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
when i began interviewing to become a
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighter i found it to be
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
an extremely competitive process
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
there were limited vacancies and when a
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
position opened it would be ex it was it
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
would be extremely competitive
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
it was common to see dozens of
 
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.430 align:start position:0%
it was common to see dozens of
candidates

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
applying for one position now you see
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
the same positions being posted
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
repeatedly and maybe even a hiring bonus
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
attached to it in an attempt to attract
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
qualified candidates
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
my story is not unique
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
many of my fellow firefighters had other
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
career opportunities where they would
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
make more money in the private sector
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
and they too declined those
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities in pursuit of a career in
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
public safety
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
coming into this profession you are
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
aware that firefighting is an unyielding
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
you are aware of the obvious dangers
 
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
that await you but it is unlikely that
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
you would be aware of the grim
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
statistics associated with your career
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
we respond to help people on their worst
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
days frequently exposing ourselves to
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
carnage the human mind struggles to
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
process and that's validated through the
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
increased rate of ptsd amongst
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
firefighters our members put themselves
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
in hazardous environments to protect the
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
public we serve
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this too can be validated
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
through the increased rate of cancer
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
among firefighters
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
with these with the increased awareness
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
regarding the health and safety concerns
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
associated with our profession
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
accompanied with the added cost pushed
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
down onto employees by the legislature
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
in 2011 and the reduction in the benefit
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of your career you have to
 
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.190 align:start position:0%
at the end of your career you have to
wonder

00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
who are we going to be able to attract
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
to do these careers in public safety
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
if we don't value these positions
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
we should be careful of our expectation
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
out of these positions in the future
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
a vote in favor of house bill 1587 is an
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
ethical decision to allow a return on
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
the 11.8 percent of their hard-earned
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
wages they paid towards their retirement
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative schmidt you will you
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
be able to support the subcommittee
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
well that wasn't going to be my question
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
in this instance
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
if they haven't heard of the first 30
 
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.149 align:start position:0%
if they haven't heard of the first 30
times

00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
they're not going to hear it
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
you are obviously
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%

david
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
my name is seif uragasa i represent the
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire chief prohibition parole
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
officers i am the
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
i'm the president for the command staff
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh when back in 2011 they
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
established a new law that uh require
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
members to contribute so at 11.5
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
i was about nine years and eight months
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
to the state service so this bill affect
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
me personally and
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
many others
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
in many different levels and
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
until this day it continued to affect us
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh in a way it is it creates a parity
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
issue where
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
employees that basically went to the
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
same academy with me because they were
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
hired three months prior to me they
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
contributed the same money
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
they served the same agency they went to
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
the same academy but those employees can
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
keep they can pay
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
what is required by the state to pay but
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
they are able to
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
have their highest
 
00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.470 align:start position:0%
have their highest
three

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
years included no five years three years
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
whereas myself and many others are told
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
that now we're changing
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
the system and you will be affected
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
retroactively even though you're nine
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
years and ten months
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
we understand that we won't be honoring
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
what we honor for other employees
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
therefore we have a new paying system
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
for you where you will pay high
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
will collect that money but that money
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
won't go towards to your retirement or
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
in determining
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
the highest five years
 
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.950 align:start position:0%
the highest five years
um

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how the state even
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
can do away with that probably it was
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
from the advertisement that was in the
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
state retirement website and you guys
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
can view it until this day it says your
 
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.270 align:start position:0%
can view it until this day it says your
five

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
five highest year compensation
 
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.190 align:start position:0%
five highest year compensation
yeah

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
sure do you want me to bring this to you
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
so you can see it
 
00:37:37.200 --> 00:38:03.589 align:start position:0%
so you can see it
yes

00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
many of us uh the first affected group
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
learned about this in 2020 so when they
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
changed it not only they changed it
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
but then they started spreading
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
business information where you can keep
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
still your five highest year for most
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
people including myself
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
highest year highest five years highest
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
three years really wasn't that much so
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
we were okay to live with it
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately when we learn what it
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
means and how it is interpreted
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
as you can see a house room
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
room full of public servants and many of
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
them who couldn't be here and this is
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a season where we all will
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
come up and ask lawmakers and what
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
exactly happened to so fast we were told
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
hired under certain condition
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
not only you increase our compensation
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
payment now
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
you're changing the years how many years
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
will contribute now
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
the money that we are contributing you
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
can legally take them but then it won't
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
be calculated it's a hard pill to
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
swallow so
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here in support of the bill i
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
support uh
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
those who have the initiative to serve
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
to write this bill
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
and bring it and if anything i mean it
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
won't fix
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
most of the problem we have but it is a
 
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.069 align:start position:0%
most of the problem we have but it is a
start

00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
to give back to
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
the responders and as you all know the
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
people who are affected by this bill are
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers and
 
00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.750 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers and
firefighters

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
who are first responders who hope to
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
answer all the emergencies we have
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
including covet
 
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.990 align:start position:0%
including covet

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
so

on dealing with these type of
 
00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.030 align:start position:0%
on dealing with these type of
individuals

individuals
 
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.150 align:start position:0%
individuals
um

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
i am also
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
a member of the
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
executive board of nhpa and i'm
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
president of the new hampshire probation
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
and parole officers association
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
i've worked for the department of
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
corrections for 15 years now
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
and i've
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
some faith i've grown up with family who
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
worked in law enforcement and i know
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
for a fact that people have come from
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
all over the country to come work as a
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
first responder in law enforcement
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's largely based because of the
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
benefits at the time and the good
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
retirement system that we had here i
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't think you see that anymore i think
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
that the instability of the retirement
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
system is concerning to people and i
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
think it is a driving force behind the
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention issues i think
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire has been
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
fortunate in that there have been no
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
big incidents that have made national
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
headlines i think it's largely because
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
quality of people that new hampshire has
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
attracted over the years
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
as with anything else i think you get
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
what you pay for
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
in life
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
that being said uh when this change came
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
to fruition in 2012 i was not very
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
educated i was still young i didn't
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
understand the ramifications of it all
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
but i've in recent years i have done my
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
best to try to educate myself and
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
understand the system
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
and the flaws and the reasons for the
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
proposed changes back in 2012
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
and when i sit and think about them i
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
i can almost understand them almost
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
but then i think one thing that i often
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
think is president when i deal with
 
00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:25.589 align:start position:0%
think is president when i deal with
issues

00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
and and that is what's right is
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
right in my time as president i've dealt
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
with number issues and i
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
when considering them i just try to
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
decide if
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
if this
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
fight or this position is
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
principally right and if it's reasonable
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
to everybody involved
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
and this fight this issue this bill is
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
we support on behalf of the probation
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
parole officers association i support
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
this bill not because
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
it fixes what was taken from us in 2012
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
but because a step in the right
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
direction to
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
remedy what
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.589 align:start position:0%

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
work with eight other officers
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
there are a total of 13 in manchester
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
specifically okay and is that a full
 
00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:45.750 align:start position:0%
specifically okay and is that a full
compliment

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
compliment
 
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.550 align:start position:0%
compliment
or

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
should there be more technically there
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
should definitely be more that's an
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
ongoing issue that we attempt to address
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
within the department and state
 
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.510 align:start position:0%
within the department and state
and

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
i assume that there have been efforts to
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
hire more um yes what kind of response
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
have you gotten uh we've
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
a slow one but there is increasing
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
attempts and we've gotten a couple of
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
offices here here and there over the
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
last few years
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
nowhere near is
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
enough but
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know we do what we can we do the
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
best we can and we we enjoy it we take
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
pride in our work
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
and we'll continue to work hard
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering our questions
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:44.230 align:start position:0%
 
good gija

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
and committee members please move closer
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the mic
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
my name is michael gea i'm the president
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire police association
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today to convey our support
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
to house bill 1587.
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
you have heard from others who testified
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
before me as to what this bill does
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
i want to take just a few minutes to
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
explain to you why this bill is so
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
important to law enforcement throughout
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
our state
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
first let me say that 10 years ago when
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
numerous changes were made to the
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
state's retirement program it was
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
impossible to anticipate the
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances that would develop like we
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
have today
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
but some of these changes laid the
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
foundation for hiring and retention
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
problems by altering provisions and
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
benefits that had been agreed to when
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
some members were hired
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
fast forward to 2022
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and just
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
about every city and town are facing
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
serious employment challenges in the
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
public safety area
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
especially law enforcement a state
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
police have dozens of unfilled positions
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
and local communities are finding the
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
applicant pool to be extremely tight
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
with that cities and towns are
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
competing against each other for not
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
only the limited number of new hires but
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
in retaining existing personnel
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
competition from other states
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
the private sector
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
and in some cases outright burnout
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
are adding to this very concerning
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
public safety problem
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
i want you to know that there is a very
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
concerning out of the ordinary trend
 
00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:21.270 align:start position:0%
concerning out of the ordinary trend
developing

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
developing
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
the number of employees who are leaving
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
before they reach their 20 or 25 years
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
is very real that is something none of
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
us could have contemplated just a few
 
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
the one tool that can help address this
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
problem is strengthening the retirement
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
benefits so there is incentive to stay
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
for the full term
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
we believe hb 1587 is the kind of tool
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
that will help in retaining those
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
individual who might be thinking about
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
leaving early
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly the economics makes
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
sense local communities spend an average
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
about 50 000 or more to train certify
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
and equip
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
each new police officer
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
each time one leaves the new hire
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
training costs hit local budgets and
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's if the local community can even
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
find new hires
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
we are very fortunate in this state to
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
have such a dedicated skilled and
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
qualified group of law enforcement
 
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.950 align:start position:0%
qualified group of law enforcement
officers

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
but the challenges are there for the
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
future i ask you to think hard about
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
this potential crisis and to act before
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
it gets worse
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
we all need to do everything possible to
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
encourage these individuals to work
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
their full pre-retirement terms
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's good for the safety of our
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
citizens in every community keep in mind
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
being a police officer today is a
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
challenging stressful job it is a noble
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
profession it's something i truly love
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
but every minute on the job is filled
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
with safety concerns house bill 1587
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
will help our state and local
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
communities in their recruitment and
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
retention of qualified police officers i
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
urge you to support this bill thank you
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative o'brien
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.750 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
you you said conor in your testimony
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
that this community is finding a hard
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
time can potential candidates and i i
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if you heard i i'm on the
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen and nashua as the
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
example uh we're discussing hiring a 500
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know paying a 500 bonus to get
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
police officers how much of as an impact
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
do you really think that this is really
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
affecting people looking for this type
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
of career
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of concerns today with law
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement there's a lot of policy
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
changes there's a lot of things that's
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
being implemented
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
and you have to think about it this way
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
22 year old coming in to work as a
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
police officer he's got 25 years at the
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
end of the day what is his retirement is
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to be after he's done his 25 years
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
500 dollars fi a signing bonus
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
is a probably a catching uh statement
 
00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.790 align:start position:0%
is a probably a catching uh statement
however

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
you might have a problem uh certifying
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
however he is going to be leaving in a
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
couple years after that because he is
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
made a little bit more aware of what his
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
retirement compensation at the end of
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
his 25 years
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
very good thank you thank you
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.710 align:start position:0%
other questions
representative

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so what you're saying is it's
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
not maybe a matter of initial hiring but
 
00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.109 align:start position:0%
not maybe a matter of initial hiring but
in

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
a matter of retention of officers and
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
firemen they go hand in hand
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
hiring and retention is a problem right
 
00:49:47.119 --> 00:49:49.030 align:start position:0%
hiring and retention is a problem right
now

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:50.800 align:start position:0%

i remember when i took the test there
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
was about 300 applicants
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
today we're lucky to have 25
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
and don't forget there's background
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
excessive background everything that
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
they have to go through for out of the
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
ten you might end up with two to three
 
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.150 align:start position:0%
ten you might end up with two to three
people

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.910 align:start position:0%
people
okay

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
well thank you for for your testimony
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
claudia cass

00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very own thank you very much
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i want to thank you for having
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
us all here today an opportunity to
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
speak to you
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
i'm officer claudia cass i've been
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
working for the department for almost 16
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
years now i was one of the people that
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
was hired under the original deal
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
i know there's been some
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
efforts to
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
bring everyone up to speed on how this
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
all came to be
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
obviously the pension system was
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
terribly underfunded
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
it was underfunded before i was hired it
 
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
was underfunded in part because
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities enjoyed a tax holiday and
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
did not pay into the pension system it
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
was underfunded because the market had a
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
terrible crash
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
but i was hired with a deal that i would
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
work 20 years
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i would have my best three years
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
and i would be able to bank out my sick
 
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
in my vacation time and i would pay
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
9.75 percent into the pension system
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
in 2011 they changed that retroactively
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
i had almost six years with the
 
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.950 align:start position:0%
i had almost six years with the
department

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
i was sentenced to three years in prison
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
i have to work three years that's about
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
the average sentence
 
00:51:41.839 --> 00:51:42.790 align:start position:0%
the average sentence
for

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
maybe your second drug crime or
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
your second sex offense i get to stay in
 
00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
prison because the legislature reneged
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
on a deal a promise it was made to me
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
although in fairness that bill never
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
passed that bill did not pass it was
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
christmas tree down to house bill 2 the
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
funding bill
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
and that's how we got sentenced to
 
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.790 align:start position:0%
and that's how we got sentenced to
prison

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
we have to serve more i have to pay two
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
percent more into the pension system
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
because the state shifted that onus to
 
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:08.950 align:start position:0%
because the state shifted that onus to
me

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
not only did i not get a benefit i lost
 
00:52:11.119 --> 00:52:12.710 align:start position:0%
not only did i not get a benefit i lost
benefits

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
but ever since 2011 i've sucked it up i
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
was told it was my best five years
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
and then i would have to serve 23 years
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
needless to say this has not helped our
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
recruitment and our retention we have
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
dropped our retirement age we've
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
given raises we've done everything
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
possible and we can't recruit people
 
00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.109 align:start position:0%
possible and we can't recruit people
because

00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
well he spoke of 25 years we were
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
dropped over to our hiring age to 20
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
year olds
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
they have to work 33 years to collect
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
their pension and even with this bill
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
their pension is capped at twice their
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
base salary their base salary doesn't
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
include weekends
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
does include weekend differential
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't include shift differential
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't include hazardous duty pay
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
so they will pay in these guys are
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
getting forced four to five times a week
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many of you are aware
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the staffing crisis that we have at
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
the state prison
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
but we can't staff it and we had 20
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.670 align:start position:0%
this bill
does

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
almost nothing frankly
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
almost nothing thanks for
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
including the years that i'm paying into
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
the pension system anyway in my
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
calculation it's not a gift it's a tiny
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
return on the money i'm already paying
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
and you know how poorly educated we are
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
i who have probably done the most since
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
i'm close to leaving
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
i found out today
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
today that i'm not going to be refunded
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
over 20 000 dollars that i paid into the
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
pension system over and above what
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
they're going to calculate my pension on
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
i was told
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
by the new hampshire retirement system
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
that anything that wasn't used towards
 
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.790 align:start position:0%
that anything that wasn't used towards
my

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
calculation was going to be refunded
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
so literally today sitting here and
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
hearing them testify is the first i have
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
ever been told i'm not going to get my
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
it is an election yeah the state got 1.8
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
in the stimulus package for covet belief
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
over 600 million of that went to the
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities the same municipalities
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
that started this under funding in the
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
first place and i'm certain they're
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to come here and speak
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
against paying for the first responders
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
that have protected them all these
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
years so i just want to make mention of
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
that and i also
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
was called to read in my paper
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
that the same legislature
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
paid 20 million dollars to the victims
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
this is the same legislature that we're
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
asking to give us
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
our own money in a calculation
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
so i frankly feel this is the very least
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
that you could do
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
is give us our own money that we work
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
for and paid into the pension system as
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
part of the calculation
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions you might have
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
and i says not written scribbles
 
00:55:19.119 --> 00:55:20.630 align:start position:0%
and i says not written scribbles
okay

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory overtime
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
yes sir when you were when you were
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
addressing us
 
00:55:41.839 --> 00:55:43.750 align:start position:0%
addressing us
um

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
can you elaborate as to what what
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
exactly mandatory
 
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.270 align:start position:0%
exactly mandatory
means

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory means you can't go home
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
means at the end of your shift they tell
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
you you have to stay for eight more
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
the average
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
um i i don't have this specific numbers
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
with me perhaps someone else here does
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
but it's literally thousands of hours a
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
week that we have to cover
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
to try and get the prison staffed when i
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
started we had i believe the number was
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
around 800 correctional officers
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
and i think we're down to around 400
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
we're at 50 of the staffing we're
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to have at the men's prison in
 
00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:19.910 align:start position:0%
supposed to have at the men's prison in
concord

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
concord
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then we're also required to cover
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
the other prisons so if women's prison
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
needs staffing we have to go up there
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
and staff that as well
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
so we all have to cover all the hours
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
there's a prison to run we have what's
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
called critical minimum and most days we
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
cannot even meet our critical minimum by
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
forcing every single body that we have
 
00:56:38.319 --> 00:56:40.710 align:start position:0%
forcing every single body that we have
available

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
now we are they have made some changes
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the probation parole officers are
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to help us now but their best
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
five years are tossed so for years they
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to help us and now that
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to help us people
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
like you know seifu or swarko they have
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
already spoken in their best five years
 
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.589 align:start position:0%
already spoken in their best five years
they

00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
took the initiative to come and help us
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
fill a staffing crisis and those five
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
years are going to be tossed and it's
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
going to be based on the years that they
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
weren't even allowed to help us so
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're paying into the pension system
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
on a benefit
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
that they overwhelmingly benefited all
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
and they're not even going to be able to
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
collect on that
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay have a follow-up
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
so what i'm getting in summation because
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
no idea what your world looks like
 
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.829 align:start position:0%
no idea what your world looks like
in

00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:57:31.839 --> 00:57:33.190 align:start position:0%
in
corrections

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
you are being forced to work against
 
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
your will
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
money is being taken out of your
 
00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:39.750 align:start position:0%
money is being taken out of your
paycheck

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
paycheck
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
for doing so and then you're told
 
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
sorry that we forced you into what
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
someone almost described as slave labor
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to count that that's
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
the summation of what you're getting at
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
right that is absolutely correct when i
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
was hired we didn't have as much
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
overtime we had a lot more staff the
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
women's prison wasn't open this current
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
women's prison requires a lot more
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
staffing than the previous women's
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
prison which has exasperated our
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
underfunding our understaffing rather so
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
now i do get forced more than i ever
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
would have in the beginning of my career
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
but i was under the impression it was
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
going to be my best five up until
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
summer of 2021 i know saifu said 20 i
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
did not know until 2021 when i went to
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
run my numbers that my top five years
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
are tossed
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
so these years and these times and these
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
hours have been stolen from my family
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
and my money has been stolen from my
 
00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.230 align:start position:0%
and my money has been stolen from my
check

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i had no idea
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
that i was never going to benefit from
 
00:58:35.359 --> 00:58:42.150 align:start position:0%
that i was never going to benefit from
it

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%

01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
and the reason i'm bringing this forward
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
um i contacted
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
the hampshire retirement system
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
i retired
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
2021 november 2021
 
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.829 align:start position:0%
2021 november 2021
and

01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.839 --> 01:00:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
november 2020 and when
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
i get my
 
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.990 align:start position:0%
i get my
final

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh calculations for the system what
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
happens is when you retire
 
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.470 align:start position:0%
happens is when you retire
they

01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
send your first checks based on
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
what they calculate
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
um for your average compensation
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
and they wait to get your final numbers
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
from the city or town that you retired
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
from so that they can calculate your
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
final overall compensation of what your
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
benefit will be going forward
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
when you retire they don't have that all
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
in front of them they have to wait and
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
get the
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
vacation time your sick time accruals
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
and all that calculated in later on down
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
and it usually
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
in normal years it takes
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
two maybe three months at the most for
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
this to happen
 
01:01:34.319 --> 01:01:35.190 align:start position:0%
this to happen
well

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
when i retired
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
in the middle of covered
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't get my final numbers
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh i retired in november first
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
i paperwork may 12th
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
six months later
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
and on that paperwork it says within 120
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
days after the effective date of your
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
retirement you may elect to change or
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
cancel an option by notifying new
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirement system
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
i got this six months later saying i
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
only had four months if i chose to
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
change my benefit once i get my final
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
numbers so i called the retirement
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
system this was in statute there was
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
nothing they could do there was no
 
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.069 align:start position:0%
nothing they could do there was no
exemptions

01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a ruling that they could go
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
forward and say well this is extenuating
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances to where we're at
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
so i asked them if there was a way to
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
change that to
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
make it
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
you could change it up to the 120 days
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
after you receive your final numbers
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
to give you that option
 
01:02:31.839 --> 01:02:33.109 align:start position:0%
to give you that option
and

01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
this is the language they came up with
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's in this bill
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
um marty's here
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
i think it'll do what i want but i i'm
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
not sure i just i just want to make sure
 
01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.789 align:start position:0%
not sure i just i just want to make sure
that

01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
a member is basing their final option
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh that they choose based on their final
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
calculation that they have in front of
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
them from the retirement system so
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's why i brought this forward and
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative goalie it
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
okay it doesn't look like any questions
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair again for the
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
record marty carlin representing nhrs
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have a position on this bill
 
01:03:47.359 --> 01:03:48.549 align:start position:0%
we don't have a position on this bill
however

01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative goalie summed up the the
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
issue at hand quite well the statute
 
01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.710 align:start position:0%
issue at hand quite well the statute
currently

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
gives a member member
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
120 days
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
after retirement to change their
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
survivorship option what a survivorship
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
option is
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
is the opportunity to leave some or all
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
of a pension benefit to a beneficiary if
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
they pass away
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
if a member takes the maximum amount
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's a lifetime benefit for that person
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
but they can designate you know fifty
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
percent to someone else or a hundred
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
percent and there's some other uh
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
permutations called pop-up options uh
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
and basically once that election is made
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
after after the 120 days after
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
retirement there are very limited
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances under which it can be
 
01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.390 align:start position:0%
circumstances under which it can be
adjusted

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
adjusted
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
after that there's a couple of
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
exceptions for death of a spouse
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
um or um you know divorce and the
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
divorce decree doesn't
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
award the pension to uh to the ex uh
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
type of thing but pretty much you're
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
locked in um and with that 120 day
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
limit in the statute our goal
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
is has been to try to get all benefits
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
finalized within 120 days
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
however there are times of the year
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
where a backlog builds up
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
july is our busiest month because pretty
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
much all the teachers retire
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of their contract year so
 
01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.190 align:start position:0%
at the end of their contract year so
that

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's probably four times more than the
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
next highest month and you know five or
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
six times higher than other months you
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
know we can't can't staff for the year
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
for that one month so we things get
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
behind and also we have issues sometimes
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
with employers not sending in all these
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
trailing wages or the proper termination
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
forms that was
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
the the nexus of the bill last week that
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
you heard house bill 1318 it's sort of
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
part of the same coin uh is is the issue
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
goalie brought forth here um
 
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:42.870 align:start position:0%
goalie brought forth here um
and

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know he did reach out to us with
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
what his specific intention was and the
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
language in the bill is something we
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
looked at and
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
found you know we could administer
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
six and seven just to reference
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
date of the original notice of
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
retirement uh provided by the retirement
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
system not to include any future benefit
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
adjustments that may be carried out and
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
what that is is you know
 
01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.670 align:start position:0%
what that is is you know
occasionally

01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
somebody retires in months or even years
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
after uh you know an audit issue
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
comes up and um
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know there's a pension adjustment so
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
we wanted to have that language in so
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's that initial finalization notice
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
and if some something else turns up
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
later it doesn't you know five years
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
down the road they couldn't change their
 
01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.109 align:start position:0%
down the road they couldn't change their
option

01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know we are comfortable that we can
 
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.309 align:start position:0%
you know we are comfortable that we can
administer

01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
administer
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
this um provision as written
 
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.390 align:start position:0%
this um provision as written
and

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know manage that
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know without any additional issue
 
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
be glad to answer any questions
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes could you just tell me
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
when um
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
during their career
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
a person who's
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
eligible for the retirement system when
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
during their career can they make this
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
change can they make it just at
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
any time
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
not not i'm not really focused on at the
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
very end when they retire but throughout
 
01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
can they make that change and about how
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
how often does that happen uh
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
active members or you know or people who
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
have yet to retire can change their best
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
beneficiary designation at any point you
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
know in their career they just would
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
fill out a new form um and either um you
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
know and get it to us and the most you
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
know the valid notarized form most
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
recently have on file is in effect
 
01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
recently have on file is in effect
um

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
you know that that that would enable if
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
the member passes away
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
um the beneficiary to to
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
um receive death benefits in the statute
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
actually the next bill being heard um
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't it isn't analogous to this bill
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
but it touches on the same statute and
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
would change
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
what benefits are available to
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries if an active member passes
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
away but while you're still working you
 
01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.430 align:start position:0%
away but while you're still working you
can

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
change your beneficiary at any point and
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
once you retire if you took the maximum
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
amount for instance or or another
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
another non
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
option that doesn't continue on as a
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
benefit you could change that
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
beneficiary afterwards as well but that
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
person would only be
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
eligible for a lump sum benefit so um
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know pretty much this after the 120
 
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.829 align:start position:0%
you know pretty much this after the 120
days

01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know you're pretty much locked
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
into that beneficiary they that
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
beneficiary does have the option to
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
renounce the benefit uh on their own if
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
they want to
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
but after retirement you're more locked
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
into your beneficiary but pre-retirement
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
you can change it you know every other
 
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.269 align:start position:0%
you can change it you know every other
day

01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
people do change their beneficiaries we
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
encourage them to um especially because
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know if you filled out that
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
beneficiary form when you were hired you
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
may have had a lot of life events you
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
know in the ensuing years family
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
marriage divorce anything like that we
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
want to make sure
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
the person you intend to receive
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative fellows they're talking
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
about whether your survivor
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
should you die after retirement will get
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
your will get the same amount as you did
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
or whether it'll only be half or a
 
01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.910 align:start position:0%
or whether it'll only be half or a
quarter

01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.590 align:start position:0%
quarter
it's

01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
yes and so it's not complicated if the
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
per if the employee
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
dies before they retire that's
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
straightforward because if just whatever
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
name they have in the business
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
but i believe that if you choose say a
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
of your pension goes to your survivor
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
the pension you'll receive is less than
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
it would be otherwise to account for
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
that just actually actuarial actually
 
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.550 align:start position:0%
that just actually actuarial actually
balanced

01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
right seeing none thank you
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and art beaudry wishes to
 
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:18.310 align:start position:0%
thank you and art beaudry wishes to
testify

01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
again good morning madam chairman
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
my name is arthur beaudry i represent
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state permanent
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
firefighters retirement association and
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here in favor of house bill 1557
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
it just be brief choosing an option when
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
you retire is a big decision
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
for you and your family and it's a
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
lifetime decision
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't be made lightly all the
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
information needed to make that decision
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
at uh available to the member prior to
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
making that decision
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
and this bill shouldn't cost any
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
additional dollars because the um
 
01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
additional dollars because the um
as

01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
the the chairman mentioned when when you
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
take an option you can take a a straight
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
annuity where you don't cover your
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
spouse you could take a 50 option you
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
can take uh 100 option where she would
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
get or he would get 100 of your benefit
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
and then you can take pop-ups and each
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
one of those options cost
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
so much money
 
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.590 align:start position:0%
so much money
and

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
not having the final numbers to make
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
that decision could really play an
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
impact to your family so
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is really a straightforward
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation where it is no cost
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
and it really helps the member make a
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
decision for for their families
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
and just don't get confused with the
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
death benefit
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
and a pension benefit because the death
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
benefit's going to be coming up if you
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
die while you're working
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
and you didn't you have to have 20 years
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
of service you can sign a form and your
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
your spouse will get 50 percent of your
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
benefit if you didn't sign that form
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
your spouse would get your money back in
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
interest and and
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much uh i shouldn't say that's it
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
but yeah um we're looking at if um you
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
know where you can get a hundred percent
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
of that benefit and that's going to be
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
coming up but there's two different
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
things a death benefit and then your
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
your pension benefit for your spouses
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
and i will take any questions
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
questions

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
it seems like we've covered this one
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
already thank you okay
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none i'll close the public
 
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.750 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none i'll close the public
hearing

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
and we have a bit of time before our
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis suggests that we
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
could vote on the spill already do you
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
have a motion
 
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh yes i'd like to move otp on house
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
bill 1557
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
hi second seconded by representative
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
grod okay
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
i i think we covered everything pretty
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
much it's just a very straightforward
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
thing that uh
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
people should have the information they
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
need to make a decision like this enough
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
time to make it and they shouldn't lose
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
that opportunity because the retirement
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
system isn't able to get the information
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
in the required amount of time
 
01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.550 align:start position:0%
in the required amount of time
representative

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you it seems prudent to the
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
employer employee to have the
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
information that they need before they
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
need to make before they make the
 
01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.630 align:start position:0%
need to make before they make the
decision

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i understand uh
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
what was being said there
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
so currently after they receive
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
notice of return or give notice of
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
retirement whatever the trigger is
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
employees have 120 days
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
to make the decision
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
if there's a screw-up
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
and they don't get that in from they
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
don't get their paperwork
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
they have to hope they made the correct
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
decision with incomplete information
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
they're stuck and after that
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
um period of time
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
are they
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
um stuck with that decision for the
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
entirety of their retirement as mr
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
carlin said you can only change your
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
survivorship benefit in very rare
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
and special circumstances a divorce
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
right right that's what i understand oh
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
they're stuck just wanted to make sure
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
because it seems fairly common sense to
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
me so
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%

01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%

okay and motion passes 14 to 1.
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
represents something assassin will you
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
be writing a minority report
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes and no objection to consent
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
what's that you know objection to
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
consent okay that's fine we'll put this
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
on i'll write the majority report unless
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.790 align:start position:0%
okay
i'm

01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
pretty sure 1587 will not be quite that
 
01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.630 align:start position:0%
pretty sure 1587 will not be quite that
easy

01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
easy
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
will take it take a break before the
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.070 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
personally don't understand why it takes
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
that long
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
what difference does it make what your
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
exact last number is going to be
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
i don't need that but
 
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.470 align:start position:0%
i don't need that but
if

01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the
 
01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:42.229 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the
problem

01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
about how brave people are
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's all gone
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
oh yeah hi
 
01:18:01.679 --> 01:18:03.189 align:start position:0%
oh yeah hi
so

01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know yesterday i
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:38.470 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
financial integration or management of
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
well i'm just thinking i don't know
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what i don't have a specific
 
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.790 align:start position:0%
exactly what i don't have a specific
word

01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:14.550 align:start position:0%
word
yeah

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
the light recently especially recently
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:08.790 align:start position:0%
is that
we

01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
were so focused on this being an option
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
that occurred when you were eligible to
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
retire we never really thought about
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
what happens to those that pass away
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
before that eligibility occurs
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it basically
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
says look um
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
you know what we there's no reason to
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
wait until you're eligible to retire to
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
simply fill out a form as to what your
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
plans are
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
and that's all this does is it opens
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
this up
 
01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.629 align:start position:0%
this up
to

01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
for you to have the ability to do this
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
now currently on line three
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
it mentions any member upon joining the
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
retirement system or any member who has
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
reached retirement service age we have
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
been made aware that that really does
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
kind of leave a gap in the middle for
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
existing employees
 
01:36:56.239 --> 01:36:57.109 align:start position:0%
existing employees
um

01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
and that will certainly need to be
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
quickly amended and i'll either tom or
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
my representative lanzar or myself will
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
be happy to make sure that gets taken
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
care of but we certainly don't want to
 
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
leave a gap the
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
the gap that we have right now has kind
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
of put us in this situation to begin
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
with so
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
um i just i just want to bring that to
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
you to your uh attention here so
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
certainly don't be
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
don't be overly concerned with all the
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
legalese here but this is just this just
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
basically outlines what you see below is
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
the procedure so and that's really not
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
changing it's just it's just a matter of
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
when you're going to feel your or your
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative lucas
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
just to
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
to clarify something so there was a
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
discussion during an earlier bill about
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know people can specify their
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
beneficiary and change it at any time
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
how does that differ
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
from i mean is this this obviously is
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
different but what is this versus that
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
so what happens when you go to retire
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
and you look at your options
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
you are not solely looking at your
 
01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:07.830 align:start position:0%
you are not solely looking at your
options

01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
options
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
because your spouse must agree and sign
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
off to that option
 
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.590 align:start position:0%
off to that option
and

01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
that is something that
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
in this particular case if you are going
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
to do this like i was i was
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
not married when i entered into the
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
system but two years later i was
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
i would have been able to come in and
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
sit down with my wife and look at this
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
and say you know what as of right now
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
this is this is how we want this to
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
unfold and that way in the event that i
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
pass away
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're where we need to be if i pass away
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
beforehand but but in order to make a
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
change later let's you know let's say we
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
review this when i am eligible to retire
 
01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:44.550 align:start position:0%
review this when i am eligible to retire
and

01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
she and i think something different
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
should pas you know should
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
be the way we do things then we have the
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
option to change that
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.390 align:start position:0%
at that point
follow-up

01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't get to to what i'm
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
wondering um
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
about you know there's some sort of um
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
you know survivor benefit
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
that people are currently able to
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
apparently specify
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
before they retire and change at any
 
01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.590 align:start position:0%
before they retire and change at any
time

01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
how is that different from the thing
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
this controls so
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
so what happens as of right now is until
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
you are eligible to retire that
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
paperwork is not
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
is not filled out
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit different
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different area this
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the pension benefit
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
that you get
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
and it's not has nothing to do with
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
being killed in the line of duty or that
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
a good quick follow-up
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay so the one the the one that was
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
being mentioned before is
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
for uh the death benefit not for
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
anything with retirement yeah this this
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
particular bill 1497 has nothing to do
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
with death benefits no but i mean the
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
prior discussion i wasn't here for the
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
prior discussion this this is about
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
pre-selecting your
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
essentially your survivorship benefit
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
prior to being eligible to retire so
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
that you could do it say after you got
 
01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:09.990 align:start position:0%
that you could do it say after you got
married

01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
married
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
or whenever
 
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
i mean without necessarily being
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
eligible what's confusing me is there
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
was a discussion from mr carlin
 
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:18.950 align:start position:0%
was a discussion from mr carlin
about

01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
some kind of selection that could be
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
done at any time and ongoing and i just
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't understand perhaps we should wait
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
for mr carlin to explain since he's the
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
next speaker so so i'll give you
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative like i'll give you a real
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
example here a guy that i worked with in
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
manchester passed away
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
right before
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
actually well one of them was before one
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
of them was after they were eligible
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
they'd never filled the paperwork out
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
with this with the state that caused a
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
significant problem with his spouse
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how this was all
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
so this just gives the ability
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
for us to just fill the paperwork out
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
sooner that's really it there's no
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
increased benefit it doesn't it doesn't
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.119 --> 01:41:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
let me see if i understand this
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
from my i'm going to compare it to my
 
01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.270 align:start position:0%
from my i'm going to compare it to my
retirement

01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
so when i retired
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
i had an option of taking my retirement
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
package as one lump sum
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
or i could have it spaced out and as an
 
01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.109 align:start position:0%
or i could have it spaced out and as an
annuity

01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
annuity
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's an example of the kinds of
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
decisions that you're talking about
 
01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:31.830 align:start position:0%
decisions that you're talking about
making

01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
before you actually retire so that
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
if and it's done in conjunction with
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
your spouse
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
so that if something happens to you
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
before you retire before you retire
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
then there's a plan
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
for those benefits
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
and they're outlined by you and your
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
spouse before something happens to you
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying yeah so what
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
happens is there there's a list of
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
choices that the retirement system
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
presents to you and it involves
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
are you willing to take a reduced
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
benefit for survivorship of a spouse you
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
know or
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
or your spouse is willing to not do that
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
at all and you take a much higher
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
benefit but if you pass away it
 
01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:12.070 align:start position:0%
benefit but if you pass away it
disappears

01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
disappears
 
01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:12.790 align:start position:0%
disappears
so

01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
the you you don't get to sit down and
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
dictate this the retirement system has
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
has choices and you and your and your
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
spouse will
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
pick whichever one is is you think is
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
the best for you but as under current
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
law you cannot do that until you're
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
eligible to retire
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
and if you pass away beforehand this
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
then we get the mess that we've been
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair
 
01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
so are you are you all does this bill
 
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:40.950 align:start position:0%
so are you are you all does this bill
also

01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
allow for you to change those things
 
01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
as um
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
or you only get one shot at it let's say
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
you do it when you're first married and
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
then 20 years later you decide you want
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
something else because you know life is
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
different and
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
modify it as you get older
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's a fantastic question for mr
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
carlin but my understanding is that in
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
you don't lock this in until you
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
actually retire okay thank you i'm sure
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
he can expound on that much better than
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
i can okay thank you
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
so the prior one where they where they s
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
the prior one where they said uh
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
you could change it at any time
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
during your
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
during your working life
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
that was pension i guess huh and this is
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
something different that was that you
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
could change at any time the name of
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
your beneficiary
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
zender fellows thank you
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
so the language that is being added here
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
says upon joining the retirement system
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
so the example that you gave
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
of getting married like two two years
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
after you joined the retirement system
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
this the word doesn't include what you
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
just described correct as i opened we do
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
need to amend this
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
to include
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
any existing member that was an
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
oversight when it was drafted
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
it left a gap between those that get
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
hired and those that are eligible folks
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
like me that are in the middle
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
were were inadvertently excluded from
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
this and that's an easy correction we'll
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
okay um for the record again marty
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
carlin representing the new hampshire
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
nhrs doesn't have a position on the bill
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
we did prepare a handout
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
with some
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
background information on the bill but
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
while the change itself is fairly
 
01:45:21.199 --> 01:45:22.870 align:start position:0%
while the change itself is fairly
straightforward

01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances um you know the other
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
factors around it do seem to be a little
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
confusing so i'm going to sort of step
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
back you know 5 000 feet and kind of
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
walk back to this bill
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
active members
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
are encouraged to fill out a beneficiary
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
form once they start working
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
and up they can update that beneficiary
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
form at any time throughout their career
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know that they want to change the
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
beneficiary um the form can either be
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
submitted online through their account
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
or they need to send us a notarized
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
paper form but um you know they can do
 
01:45:57.679 --> 01:45:58.550 align:start position:0%
paper form but um you know they can do
that

01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
constantly if they would like
 
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
we try to encourage people to do that um
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
as much as we can and make sure it's you
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
know we say make sure you like the
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
person who's on that right now
 
01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.350 align:start position:0%
person who's on that right now
if

01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
an active member
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
dies while they're in service while
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
they're working and contributing there
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
are statutory death benefits available
 
01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:18.950 align:start position:0%

a8
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
refers to non-job-related death you know
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
a terminal illness not related to work
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
an accident
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%

death benefits
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
and those are automatic
 
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh we paid to the beneficiary on file it
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know presuming there is one which um
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
and um you know we just need to be
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
notified of the death and the
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances to move that along
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
so that those those are existing sort of
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
automatic there's no paperwork a member
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
has to fill out to do anything uh you
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
know to make their beneficiary
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%

contributing into the retirement system
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
before any benefit can be paid to a
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
beneficiary uh yes and actually it may
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
be if the committee thinks it's of use i
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
can send you our uh handout on the death
 
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.430 align:start position:0%
can send you our uh handout on the death
the

01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
statutory death benefits just for
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
background purposes basically please do
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
so a job a non-job-related death
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
if it occurs at any point in their
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
career the beneficiary would get the a
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
lump sum of the members contributions
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
refunded to them so the member money is
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
always going to go back to a beneficiary
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
if there is one
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
if the
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
non-job-related death if the member has
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
more than 10 years and is vested in the
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
pension system
 
01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:10.719 align:start position:0%
a spouse beneficiary would have the
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
option of taking 50 of their pension as
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
calculated on the date of death or a
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
lump sum equal to their accumulated
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
contributions plus a year's salary
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
and statutorily that's only available to
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
a spouse beneficiary if you had a
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
non-spouse beneficiary a partner or a
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
child or
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
cousin or whatever they would get the
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
lump sum payment is would be their only
 
01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:33.270 align:start position:0%
lump sum payment is would be their only
option

01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
the spouse would have the option of
 
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
choosing whichever one made more sense
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
to them the job-related death benefits
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
accidental death um there's a it's a
 
01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.830 align:start position:0%
accidental death um there's a it's a
50

01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
um benefit let me read this um that
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
there's no minimum service for that so
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh is killed early in their career and
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know in the line of duty uh there is
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
a benefit payable and i
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
literally just had that sheet in front
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
of me there it is
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
so for a group one member it's 50 of the
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
members average final compensation is
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
payable um
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
to a surviving spouse uh slightly
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
different for group two it's fifty
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
percent of the members annual rate of
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation in the year they
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
died so um that that might or might not
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
be a larger number but those those are
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
automatic benefits so that's sort of the
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
landscape on beneficiary designation
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
pre-retirement and death benefits
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
so what what this bill talks about is
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
something called pre-selection of a
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
survivorship option and that's under rsa
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
1813 not under the death benefit statute
 
01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.709 align:start position:0%
1813 not under the death benefit statute
and

01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
add to the level of confusion it's the
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
same sentence that representative
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
goalie's bill addresses but it does
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
something completely different um you
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
know and they don't there's no overlap
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
between them so
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
what what right now the way that bill
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
a13 is uh phrased members who are
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for service retirement can
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
pre-select a survivorship option so this
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
is somebody who is eligible to retire
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know they're older than 60 in group
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
one or they have you know they're older
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
than six in group two or have their 45
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
and 20 46 and 21 etc and filling out
 
01:50:11.119 --> 01:50:11.990 align:start position:0%
and 20 46 and 21 etc and filling out
another

01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
another form for the pre-selection if
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
they pass away while they're still
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
working the spouse would get 100 of
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
their pension as calculated you know on
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
on the date of their death
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay um so that obviously the 100
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
benefit is better than a 50 benefit but
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
the the member has to take an
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
affirmative action to fill out this form
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
and submit it to us and they all are
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
only allowed to do that once they're
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for service retirement so for
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
instance i'm not eligible for service
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
retirement i can't fill out a
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
pre-selection yet you know under the
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
current statute um you know the you know
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
there are issues with people who
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
are eligible and may not realize that
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
this benefit exists we try to we when we
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
do our
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
member education presentations we have a
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
slide on this
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
we include references to it in
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
newsletters we've done standalone emails
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know and and it's it's one of these
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
where you say this sounds to be good to
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
be true but it actually is it gives
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
someone who is continuing to work after
 
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
they're technically eligible to retire a
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
little more peace of mind if they pass
 
01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:18.229 align:start position:0%
little more peace of mind if they pass
away

01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
um you know the spouse would get a
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
larger benefit than
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
the automatic benefits under the other
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
statute so um what this bill would do
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
is allow members prior to service
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
retirement eligibility to designate that
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
pre-selection option
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
um it wouldn't take effect if you know
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
the person was you know 42 years old
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
when they died and they weren't eligible
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
for service retirement but you know a 22
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
year old could check the box on the
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
beneficiary form for this
 
01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:46.950 align:start position:0%
beneficiary form for this
and

01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
40 years later you know it's still in
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
effect they don't have to
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
be told about it and remember to do it
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
once they they become eligible for
 
01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
service retirement so
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
um you know so to the extent that some
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
people have already done these and some
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
people haven't this would make it easier
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
for more people to do this designation
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
right now it's two separate forms that
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
members have to fill out to do this the
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
regular beneficiary form and the
 
01:52:10.159 --> 01:52:11.669 align:start position:0%
regular beneficiary form and the
pre-selection

01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
pre-selection
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
and um you know the names have to match
 
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
you can't have different beneficiaries
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
on those two forms uh under this bill if
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
if it's passed and it was
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
a version of this was floated in the
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
senate last year so so we looked at it
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
it was an amendment it wasn't a bill
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
that didn't advance um you know we could
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
combine the pre-selection as another box
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the regular beneficiary form so
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
throughout someone's career they can
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
update their beneficiary and
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
check or choose not to check the
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
pre-selection box at any time as well so
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
it would streamline the paperwork issue
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
involved in this
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
and you know fortunately you know there
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
are very few in-service deaths of our
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
members you know obviously there's some
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
higher profile you know tragedies that
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
go on but just you know dying of a
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
disease or in a car accident you know
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
we've you know averaged you know there's
 
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
probably you know 66 to 73 over the last
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
three years per year and not all of
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
those people are eligible for service
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
retirement this affects you know younger
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
members as well so
 
01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:11.189 align:start position:0%
members as well so
um

01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know the actuary didn't see any kind
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
of cost issue with expanding this
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
because it's a it's such a small pool
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
out of a 48 000 active members
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know that that any additional
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
benefits that a
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
beneficiary would get
 
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
um you know wouldn't show up in the
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
rounding if you will on on the rates and
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
another difference is
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
the pre-selection allows you to
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
designate any beneficiary for this um
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
not just the spouse where
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
the the death benefits there's some
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
things that are only specific to a
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
spouse and obviously in 1968 that was
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
sort of the nuclear family model and
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
people may have different beneficiaries
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
now than they did then
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
is sort of a bigger picture i'm glad to
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions anybody has
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
about the bill
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
so the people that are affected that
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
getting this additional benefit
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
are individuals who are not yet eligible
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
no they they
 
01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
die in service
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
they have to be eligible for service
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
retirement and fill out the form you
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
know under this law so they it's almost
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's almost like a dormant benefit if
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
you're 30 years old and you check this
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
box and you die
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
so you don't get the benefit if you're
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
not eligible for service retirement the
 
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
pre-selection benefit is 100
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know to the beneficiary is only for
 
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
people who are service retirement
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
eligible under a13 so it it it's an
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
enhanced death benefit essentially but
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's only available if somebody dies
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
and is eligible for retirement
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think i would love to have your uh
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
information packet on this because i'm
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
getting thoroughly confused it and
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually i know i had stopped but i did
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
look at my notes i know representative
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
pearson addressed the
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the phrasing of any member or
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
point joining their retirement system
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
and we had a question whether the intent
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
was that anybody you know in their
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
career as you know any active member
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
could do this and would suggest
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
clarification on that
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's a strikethrough in the bill
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
um online
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
same line where it strikes out uh
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
sections one and two of rsa 100 a5 and
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
refers only to a5
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
and 185 pertains to
 
01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:35.910 align:start position:0%
and 185 pertains to
both

01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
service and early service retirement
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
benefits so it it seems like it would
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
as written open the universe of people
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
who could do receive something on the
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
pre-selection if a member who's eligible
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
for early service retirement passes away
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
that they would be payable to them too
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
and we just wanted to clarify if that
 
01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:55.189 align:start position:0%
and we just wanted to clarify if that
was

01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
the intent if it was and then it's fine
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
the way it is um
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
in early service retirement real quickly
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
is it's you're collecting your pension
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
before your full retirement age and it's
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
reduced uh you know by factors you know
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
how far away you are from retirement how
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
long you worked
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question shoot
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
mr carlin i i will bring up another
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
scenario and i wonder if the
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
system has considered this
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
if an active member designates say their
 
01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:34.550 align:start position:0%
if an active member designates say their
spouse

01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
spouse
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
and then just leaves that in the system
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
for years and years
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
and the spouse
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
passes away before
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
would that complicate things for the
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
retirement system if that's the
 
01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:53.830 align:start position:0%
retirement system if that's the
beneficiary

01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
so the the the members beneficiary has
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
passed away and then the member dies in
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
service with that person never changed
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that that would
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
there would be no lifetime benefit
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
payable to anyone in that sense because
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
the the beneficiary of the the benefit
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
is also deceased but the refund of
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
contributions and those that that would
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
go to the estate and it would have to go
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
through the you know the probate process
 
01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.550 align:start position:0%
through the you know the probate process

01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%

definitely necessary representative
 
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.189 align:start position:0%
definitely necessary representative
o'brien

01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
o'brien
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you man i'm sure mr collins
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
just to clarify with uh representative
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
schuett's question
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
i think in my time that one can declare
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
multiple benefits if if i were to put
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
down my wife and then if i was fearful
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
of her passing in the future i could
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
name children or other who i choose am i
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
correct so the system allows multiple
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries yes i i did to try to keep
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
it sort of simple aside you know i was
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
talking about a single beneficiary but
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
the law allows a member to designate
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
multiple beneficiaries and assign a
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of the benefit to them to the
 
01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.189 align:start position:0%
percentage of the benefit to them to the
multiples

01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
multiples
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
the law does limit that to any number of
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
your children and or your spouse so you
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't do you know three cousins it
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
would have to be one person but for the
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
sort of immediate family um you know you
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
you could allow multiple beneficiaries
 
01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
and and there's also a provision
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh we're talking about beneficiaries
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's you know who the benefits are
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
payable to you can also designate what's
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
called the contingent beneficiary and if
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
your beneficiary has passed and you have
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
a contingent any lump sums would go to
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
that person no contingent beneficiary
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for a monthly benefit
 
01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
but you know the whatever the whatever
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
is owed to the the members of the state
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
would go to the contingent beneficiary
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
so you can have those as well
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
and those they can be multiple
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative and then psychic
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so mr carlin
 
01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:05.750 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so mr carlin
really

01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
address all these options
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the case that an employee dies before
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
he he retires or they retire
 
01:59:18.639 --> 01:59:19.910 align:start position:0%
he he retires or they retire
because

01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
it clarifies what the
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell if you had two yeah yes
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask about multiple wives
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
but we'll save that for later um
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
the question that i have is
 
01:59:43.119 --> 01:59:44.550 align:start position:0%
the question that i have is
we

01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
remind me please where
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
there was a while back we passed the
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill to allow
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
someone to get an ex-wife
 
01:59:54.719 --> 01:59:56.390 align:start position:0%
someone to get an ex-wife
beneficiary

01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
beneficiary
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
off when is it necessary
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
without her permission when is it
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
necessary for a beneficiary to give a
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
spouse beneficiary to give permission uh
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
can you remind me of that circumstance
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
yeah um actually it's on one of the
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
notes i was referring to so i'm going to
 
02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
go back to that just to make sure i've
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
given you the
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
correct answer um the the ability for a
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
member to um
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
sort of de-list the beneficiary actually
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
is is it's a non-spouse beneficiary that
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
can be taken off without their consent
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
that was one of the bills there was a
 
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
couple of bills about that um
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
going on if if it's a spouse beneficiary
 
02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
and there's a divorce in which the
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
divorce decree
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know or settlement agreement doesn't
 
02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
designate a portion of the pension to
 
02:00:44.709 --> 02:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
the spouse you know we have to follow
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
what the divorce degree says but if it's
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
if it's a there's no pension
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
obligation to the ex-spouse
 
02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
a retired member can take them off and
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
put another spouse on that was
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
one change to the
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
limited uh exceptions for
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
um changing your beneficiary after the
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
120 days and then there was another bill
 
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
it was either the year before or the
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
year after where it allowed
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
someone to take a non-spouse beneficiary
 
02:01:11.599 --> 02:01:13.430 align:start position:0%
someone to take a non-spouse beneficiary
off

02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
off
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's always been a provision where
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
the beneficiary themselves can renounce
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
ex-member who i think testified on the
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
bill you were talking about who
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
claimed he might have made a bad
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
decision with a you know a non-committed
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
relationship and was locked into the
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
beneficiary and that he was seeking that
 
02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:38.629 align:start position:0%
beneficiary and that he was seeking that
change

02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%

02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the concerns
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
but um we we've i've actually seen it
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
firsthand in manchester where we had
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
firefighters that were thinking of
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
retiring they had their paperwork in
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
their desk and never went up the ledge
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
up the concrete and signed
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
their pre-option farm and they they
 
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
passed away
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
and their spouse ends up getting 50 with
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
if they signed that form they would have
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
gotten 100 of their of their uh pension
 
02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:51.430 align:start position:0%
gotten 100 of their of their uh pension
um

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
and with the demise uh the unfortunate
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh two suicides in manchester of young
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
individuals you know their their spouses
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
ended up losing out um if they didn't
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
sign those papers and instead of again
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
instead of 100 of that individual's
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
pension they would only get 50 percent
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
if they had over 10 years of service
 
02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:14.629 align:start position:0%
if they had over 10 years of service
so

02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
you can
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
the way the existing lara is i could be
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
driving up the concave to sign my
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
pre-option form get in the car accident
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
and kill myself and my spouse ends up
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
losing 50 percent of my pension
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
with no really no fault of of the member
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
so um it is something that really should
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
be done and
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
this bill was put in in the senate last
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
year uh senator kavanaugh put it in i
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
think they tabled it
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
and we have to look at the death benefit
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
also because that is another concern
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
that was brought to my attention which
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
believe it or not i i was always under
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
the assumption
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
that if somebody dies in the line of
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
duty their spouse or beneficiary would
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
get 100 of their pay plus their money
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
and the members money back plus interest
 
02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
and i was told now that it's they only
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
get 50
 
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask mr collins if this if
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
we sign a pre-option form for a 100
 
02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:10.719 align:start position:0%
percent benefit if i were to die in the
 
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
line of duty was would my spouse still
 
02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
get a hundred percent of the benefit
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
instead of the 50 under the accidental
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
death so those are concerns um
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
i would answer any questions and but i
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
we hope that this does get rectified
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
because it there's no sense in not
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
having to be able to pick an option uh
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
upon your
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
um hiring
 
02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
especially if you if you're married and
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
you have children
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
that'll answer any questions all right
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
coming here and testifying uh that was
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
very well said and
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so this
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
basically allows someone to pre-select
 
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
ahead of time versus keeping an eye on
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
when their data is that they reach that
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
service age eligibility to have to drive
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
back up to concord when they go and do
 
02:05:02.719 --> 02:05:04.390 align:start position:0%
back up to concord when they go and do
their

02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
spouses or survivorship options uh death
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
benefit they'll be able to do this at
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
the same time while it will not go in
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
effect until they reach that age they'll
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
at least have it done and not have to
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
keep looking at the clock as to when
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
they reach eligibility that's correct
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
okay see you done thank you thank you
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
committee my name is brian rill for the
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
record i serve as the president of the
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters of new
 
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'm captain for the city
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
of portsmouth fire department
 
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
i am not the subject matter expert on
 
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
this material however i do have
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
the ability to uh somewhat simplify
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
things as i'm speaking as a firefighter
 
02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
so um what this benefit
 
02:06:08.719 --> 02:06:09.589 align:start position:0%
so um what this benefit
is

02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:06:09.599 --> 02:06:10.629 align:start position:0%
is
um

02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
is actually just a
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
a safeguard for someone that is
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
has reached retirement eligibility
 
02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
and has not filled out this
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
pre-selection form if they
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
continue to remain on the job
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
as a firefighter or
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
in the in the public sector and they
 
02:06:31.589 --> 02:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
pass away while they're retirement
 
02:06:31.599 --> 02:06:32.709 align:start position:0%
pass away while they're retirement
eligible

02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
and have not filled out this form
 
02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:35.910 align:start position:0%
and have not filled out this form
their

02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
spouse receives 50 percent of the
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
benefit they normally would have gotten
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
what this benefit is not
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
is it's not a new benefit
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
this is this is the benefit that has
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
been earned by our members
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
it is just ensuring that that benefit
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
carries on to their beneficiary uh so
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
it's extremely important um
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully madam chair i may be able to
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
speak to the question that you asked
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
earlier this does not uh allow a member
 
02:07:04.079 --> 02:07:04.950 align:start position:0%
earlier this does not uh allow a member
who

02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh was
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
25 years old who came on the job checked
 
02:07:12.069 --> 02:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
the box and say died at 30
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
this would not
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
push that benefit forward
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
they would have to sign the form at 25
 
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
years old then work their entire career
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
reach retirement service eligibility
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
for this to actually take place
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
so it does not create a benefit for
 
02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
those that don't meet the requirements
 
02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
under service eligibility
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
this is important to firefighters
 
02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:36.310 align:start position:0%
this is important to firefighters
specifically

02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
due to the changes that we talked about
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
earlier in 2011 firefighters are having
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
to work longer careers they're having to
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
work 5 10 15 years longer than they
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
normally would have
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
which puts them in a position
 
02:07:53.669 --> 02:07:53.679 align:start position:0%
that they may be more
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
susceptible to
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
passing away prior to retirement
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's extremely
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
important that we make sure that we take
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
care of the families in this situation
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
and provide the benefit that has been
 
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
earned by each of these members
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i urge you to
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
support hp 1497 and would be happy to
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony i have a
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
question is it limited to group two is
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
it for all members of the system
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
so this should be for all members of the
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
system thank you representative product
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:32.790 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:33.990 align:start position:0%
um
our

02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
our um
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
employees when they reach this 10-year
 
02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
employees when they reach this 10-year
limit

02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
limit
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
is it up to them solely to um
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
be aware of that date or are they sent a
 
02:08:50.950 --> 02:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
reminder or
 
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
this may be a
 
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
question that mr carlin may be able to
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
answer the way i understand it is it's
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
not once you are vested in the system
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's once you meet your time and age to
 
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.270 align:start position:0%
it's once you meet your time and age to
retire

02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
retire
 
02:09:08.550 --> 02:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
which for someone like me would be
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
25 years and age 45. i see
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
but to answer your questions
 
02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:15.350 align:start position:0%
but to answer your questions
specifically

02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that while educating
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
firefighters throughout the state that's
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
all i'm familiar with there are many
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
folks that are retirement eligible that
 
02:09:26.550 --> 02:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
are unaware of this
 
02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:28.069 align:start position:0%
are unaware of this
process

02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
and i know mr carlin mentioned that
 
02:09:31.990 --> 02:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's some educational materials that
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
they provide i will say that um
 
02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
i've had to search for them to find them
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
short of us putting them in front of our
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
members faces a lot of them haven't seen
 
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:44.790 align:start position:0%
members faces a lot of them haven't seen
it

02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and so in light of the
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
previous um earlier bill
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
would this make
 
02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:58.229 align:start position:0%
would this make
our

02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.239 --> 02:09:59.669 align:start position:0%
 
jobs

02:09:59.669 --> 02:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
02:09:59.679 --> 02:10:01.430 align:start position:0%
jobs
offerings

02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
offerings
 
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
more desirable would it improve
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
at all
 
02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:06.550 align:start position:0%
at all
what

02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
how the perception of the retirement
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
system or we just do nothing
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question i think
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
by answering that i'm certainly going to
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
be speculating but i would say that
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
certainly if someone who's been in the
 
02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:21.350 align:start position:0%
certainly if someone who's been in the
system

02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
is not overly educated on the matter
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
someone who has no time in the system
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
would probably struggle to to have that
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
education as well so it may not make a
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:10:40.830 --> 02:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
for your
 
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%

02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on house bill 1497
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i can interrupt for just
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%

02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
i just would like to acknowledge
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
a very nearly honorary member of this
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%

this bill will also be going to the
 
02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
pension subcommittee it's got got some
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
issues and definitely needs at least one
 
02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:17.990 align:start position:0%
issues and definitely needs at least one
amendment

02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%

you

02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%

03:05:09.510 --> 03:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:05:11.269 --> 03:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
my name is tracy amrick
 
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
represent rockingham district 21 which
 
03:05:15.030 --> 03:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
is hampton
 
03:05:17.349 --> 03:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 1549
 
03:05:19.190 --> 03:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
i know you've heard this before is a
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
this deals with special duty
 
03:05:32.550 --> 03:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
employment of police officers
 
03:05:34.230 --> 03:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
and strictly that
 
03:05:36.309 --> 03:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
the current situation is prior to
 
03:05:39.429 --> 03:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
retirement special duty details which
 
03:05:41.190 --> 03:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
are like
 
03:05:43.670 --> 03:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
working at a construction site handling
 
03:05:45.030 --> 03:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
traffic or
 
03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
escorting a wide load or anything
 
03:05:49.750 --> 03:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
non-enforcement duties non-law
 
03:05:51.510 --> 03:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement duties
 
03:05:53.349 --> 03:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
special duty does not count towards
 
03:05:53.359 --> 03:05:54.710 align:start position:0%
special duty does not count towards
retirement

03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
so if your pre-retirement all your
 
03:05:59.269 --> 03:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
special duty time does not count for
 
03:06:00.550 --> 03:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
your retirement
 
03:06:00.560 --> 03:06:01.830 align:start position:0%
your retirement
however

03:06:01.830 --> 03:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:06:03.750 --> 03:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
once you retire
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
special duty time does count towards
 
03:06:08.469 --> 03:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
your retirement
 
03:06:08.479 --> 03:06:09.510 align:start position:0%
your retirement
so

03:06:09.510 --> 03:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
once you retire and you have your
 
03:06:12.550 --> 03:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
ceiling and whatever it is i'm not going
 
03:06:14.070 --> 03:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
to get into the retirement system i
 
03:06:15.910 --> 03:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
tried to open that book
 
03:06:18.230 --> 03:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
and said i'm not going to go there
 
03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
because i i'm certainly not going to be
 
03:06:22.469 --> 03:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
an expert on the state retirement system
 
03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
whatever your deal is whenever you
 
03:06:27.110 --> 03:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
retired under
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
all i'm asking all this bill does is say
 
03:06:31.750 --> 03:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
if you do a special duty it does not
 
03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
count against your retirement hours or
 
03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:35.349 align:start position:0%
count against your retirement hours or
pay

03:06:35.349 --> 03:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
pay
 
03:06:38.230 --> 03:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
a very and if you read the bills
 
03:06:38.240 --> 03:06:39.269 align:start position:0%
a very and if you read the bills
short

03:06:39.269 --> 03:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
short
 
03:06:39.279 --> 03:06:40.230 align:start position:0%
short
short

03:06:40.230 --> 03:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
short
 
03:06:42.309 --> 03:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh it says that
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
those payments would be handled not
 
03:06:47.830 --> 03:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
charged against retirement
 
03:06:49.590 --> 03:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
and that's the upshot
 
03:06:51.910 --> 03:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative eric
 
03:06:53.590 --> 03:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
03:06:53.600 --> 03:06:56.389 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative

schmidt
 
03:06:58.550 --> 03:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and welcome
 
03:06:58.560 --> 03:07:00.230 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and welcome
colleague

03:07:00.230 --> 03:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
colleague
 
03:07:00.240 --> 03:07:01.349 align:start position:0%
colleague
um

03:07:01.349 --> 03:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
i say colleague because he's on the jcec
 
03:07:07.429 --> 03:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
with me along with representative scitec
 
03:07:07.439 --> 03:07:08.630 align:start position:0%
with me along with representative scitec
um

03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:11.349 --> 03:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
but uh so if you're not an expert on the
 
03:07:13.910 --> 03:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
um retirement system
 
03:07:15.510 --> 03:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
and neither are we
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
nobody's an expert on the retirement
 
03:07:19.670 --> 03:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
system they all have an opinion uh but
 
03:07:21.910 --> 03:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh if you're not an expert on it where
 
03:07:23.590 --> 03:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
did you come up with the idea for this
 
03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
bill the bill was the idea was given to
 
03:07:27.910 --> 03:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
me by our
 
03:07:30.389 --> 03:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
retired police chief who is now on the
 
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
rockingham county sheriff's department
 
03:07:37.030 --> 03:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:38.950 --> 03:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
other questions representative pierce i
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
think you may have chaired
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
and uh this may
 
03:07:45.990 --> 03:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
not be something you can answer
 
03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
and if that if you can't that's okay
 
03:07:52.389 --> 03:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:54.389 --> 03:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
special duty
 
03:07:54.399 --> 03:07:56.550 align:start position:0%
special duty
who

03:07:56.550 --> 03:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
is there is there a clear definition of
 
03:08:00.150 --> 03:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
what that entails
 
03:08:01.750 --> 03:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
of what is defined as special duty
 
03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
versus something else well i did
 
03:08:07.349 --> 03:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
some homework on it and it is primarily
 
03:08:09.190 --> 03:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
duties which do not include law
 
03:08:09.200 --> 03:08:11.110 align:start position:0%
duties which do not include law
enforcement

03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's like escorting over a wide
 
03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
oversized load or
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
working in a construction site alongside
 
03:08:20.309 --> 03:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
the road and doing traffic management uh
 
03:08:22.389 --> 03:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
it's not you know you you don't go out
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
and arrest people on special duty that
 
03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:33.030 --> 03:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh hi representative
 
03:08:34.710 --> 03:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
the expert is sitting in the back of the
 
03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
room on the retirement system good
 
03:08:38.790 --> 03:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
all the questions should be directed
 
03:08:41.429 --> 03:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
there here's my question these are
 
03:08:44.550 --> 03:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
you're basically talking details
 
03:08:47.190 --> 03:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry police details police details
 
03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
yes okay the question i have is um
 
03:08:51.359 --> 03:08:52.070 align:start position:0%
yes okay the question i have is um
the

03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
do they retain police powers when
 
03:08:55.910 --> 03:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing this if they see something
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
going on are they obligated as police
 
03:09:01.110 --> 03:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
officers to break up a fight uh stop an
 
03:09:02.710 --> 03:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
assault something like that i would
 
03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
assume so
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
i i that i can't answer i i don't know
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
you see my my question is that if
 
03:09:13.670 --> 03:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
if they're not police officers i'm
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
acting as police
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
they're sort of compromised are they
 
03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
wearing two hats when they're doing this
 
03:09:23.429 --> 03:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
watching a construction site
 
03:09:25.030 --> 03:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to take a bigger mind than
 
03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:27.990 align:start position:0%
that's going to take a bigger mind than
mine

03:09:27.990 --> 03:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:30.229 --> 03:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
other questions representative rose
 
03:09:31.750 --> 03:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
03:09:33.510 --> 03:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:09:35.349 --> 03:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
this is i think going to piggyback on
 
03:09:37.830 --> 03:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
what representative scitec was asking
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
but a very good friend of mine is a
 
03:09:42.229 --> 03:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
police chief in in
 
03:09:44.469 --> 03:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
a town here in new hampshire and he
 
03:09:46.950 --> 03:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
often speaks of when there are not
 
03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
enough officers in a particular town
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
that of course a neighboring town can
 
03:09:54.150 --> 03:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
come to detail for that town so that of
 
03:09:55.990 --> 03:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
course there is coverage
 
03:09:58.790 --> 03:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
so if the police officer is you know in
 
03:10:00.389 --> 03:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
in town a and just coming over to help
 
03:10:01.830 --> 03:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
town because it's a neighboring town
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's considered a detail so
 
03:10:06.309 --> 03:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
would would that
 
03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
would that count as
 
03:10:10.150 --> 03:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know this here because they're
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
certainly working in the capacity if
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
if they were needed whereas you know
 
03:10:18.229 --> 03:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
traffic detail as as far as a
 
03:10:20.229 --> 03:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
you know construction crew is a little
 
03:10:21.990 --> 03:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
bit different i think what you're saying
 
03:10:24.229 --> 03:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
it would apply if they were retired
 
03:10:31.110 --> 03:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:32.070 --> 03:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:10:33.030 --> 03:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:36.790 --> 03:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
other questions representative bailey
 
03:10:38.870 --> 03:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out what would the
 
03:10:41.110 --> 03:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative pearson was telling us
 
03:10:42.790 --> 03:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
the other day that everything had to be
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
either solving a problem or
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
there was a couple different categories
 
03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:48.309 align:start position:0%
there was a couple different categories
but

03:10:48.309 --> 03:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
what what is this solving it's like what
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
you don't want it counted towards the
 
03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
retirement system is that to avoid the
 
03:10:57.190 --> 03:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
unfunded balance no
 
03:10:58.870 --> 03:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
with the retirement system it has to do
 
03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
with how many hours they can work
 
03:11:03.190 --> 03:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
there's a limit there's a limit on a
 
03:11:04.950 --> 03:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
retiree how many hours they can work
 
03:11:06.630 --> 03:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
without going back into a full-time
 
03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:07.750 align:start position:0%
without going back into a full-time
status

03:11:07.750 --> 03:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
status
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
i see thank you and what that does is
 
03:11:11.110 --> 03:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
allow people that are kind of at the
 
03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:12.150 align:start position:0%
allow people that are kind of at the
ceiling

03:11:12.150 --> 03:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
ceiling
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
of their retirement status being able to
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
do special duty
 
03:11:17.110 --> 03:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
and not have it count against the
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
retirement status
 
03:11:19.910 --> 03:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:11:19.920 --> 03:11:21.269 align:start position:0%
i mean
follow-up

03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:11:22.870 --> 03:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
i mean do you sort of
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
are you not really retired if you're
 
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
working 40 hours of detail work or you
 
03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:28.309 align:start position:0%
working 40 hours of detail work or you
know

03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
i don't that you'll have to talk to the
 
03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
retirement system on that one that yeah
 
03:11:34.469 --> 03:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you above my paid grade
 
03:11:34.479 --> 03:11:36.870 align:start position:0%
okay thank you above my paid grade
representative

03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:11:38.710 --> 03:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative bailey asked the question
 
03:11:40.630 --> 03:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
for me
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
how efficient
 
03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative fellow
 
03:11:46.630 --> 03:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm just wondering on line
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
five what what is the distinction about
 
03:11:51.429 --> 03:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
a permanent
 
03:11:51.439 --> 03:11:54.710 align:start position:0%
a permanent
policeman

03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:56.790 --> 03:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
i can actually help with that if he
 
03:11:56.800 --> 03:11:59.990 align:start position:0%
i can actually help with that if he
can't

03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
and it defines what a permanent
 
03:12:04.790 --> 03:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
a permanent policeman is someone who is
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
eligible to be in group two as a as a
 
03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:08.070 align:start position:0%
eligible to be in group two as a as a
policeman

03:12:08.070 --> 03:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
policeman
 
03:12:14.630 --> 03:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:18.309 --> 03:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
it is defined elsewhere in the statutes
 
03:12:19.750 --> 03:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr carlin if you
 
03:12:24.870 --> 03:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
could help straighten us all the mess
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and again for the
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
record marty carlin representing the new
 
03:12:48.070 --> 03:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirement system
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me we don't have a position on
 
03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
this bill and i signed up to just
 
03:12:54.309 --> 03:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
provide some background i think
 
03:12:56.550 --> 03:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
i would agree with representative
 
03:12:58.550 --> 03:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
emmerich that this is
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward in terms of
 
03:13:02.950 --> 03:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
retirement system world but just just to
 
03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
again give a little bit higher up view
 
03:13:07.590 --> 03:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
to see how this plays in
 
03:13:11.750 --> 03:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
under the current law nhrs retirees who
 
03:13:13.349 --> 03:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
begin working part-time for a
 
03:13:15.269 --> 03:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
participating employer
 
03:13:17.910 --> 03:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
after july 1 of 19
 
03:13:17.920 --> 03:13:18.710 align:start position:0%
after july 1 of 19
are

03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:13:21.910 --> 03:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
limited to a maximum of 1352 hours in
 
03:13:24.070 --> 03:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
the calendar year it's not a weekly
 
03:13:26.550 --> 03:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
limit it's an it's a calendar year limit
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
and the
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
employers are required to track hours
 
03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
work by retirees and report them to us
 
03:13:33.429 --> 03:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the following year
 
03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
so right now
 
03:13:37.030 --> 03:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
we're still in the window to get 20 21
 
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
numbers from the employers
 
03:13:41.990 --> 03:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
if they go over 1352 there's a penalty
 
03:13:44.070 --> 03:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's a pension offset for 12 months
 
03:13:45.670 --> 03:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
which is the state's portion of their
 
03:13:47.269 --> 03:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
pension which could be a significant
 
03:13:47.279 --> 03:13:48.309 align:start position:0%
pension which could be a significant
penalty

03:13:48.309 --> 03:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
03:13:48.319 --> 03:13:49.990 align:start position:0%
penalty
um

03:13:49.990 --> 03:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:51.750 --> 03:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's a grandfathering provision for
 
03:13:54.469 --> 03:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
retirees who were working in a position
 
03:13:57.550 --> 03:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
prior to 1 1-1 of 19 they can work
 
03:14:00.150 --> 03:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
1664 hours but you know
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
as long as they stay in that position so
 
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
03:14:07.429 --> 03:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
detail pay is included in the hours
 
03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
reported for retirees just just to kind
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
of clarify
 
03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
because there are some differences
 
03:14:16.710 --> 03:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
among active members on whether uh
 
03:14:19.429 --> 03:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
the detail pay is earnable compensation
 
03:14:21.990 --> 03:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
so for anyone who's hired
 
03:14:25.269 --> 03:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
on or after july 1st of 11
 
03:14:27.670 --> 03:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
detail pay does not count they don't
 
03:14:29.670 --> 03:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
contribute on and it doesn't contribute
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
toward their pension uh it does count as
 
03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
compensation over base
 
03:14:37.510 --> 03:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
to go back to 1587 this morning for
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
members who were in the system prior to
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
um 7-1 of 11 and weren't vested for one
 
03:14:45.269 --> 03:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
one of 12 and then the
 
03:14:48.389 --> 03:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
the original uh class of of vested
 
03:14:49.750 --> 03:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
members also
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
get detail as part of their pension so
 
03:14:55.830 --> 03:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:59.030 --> 03:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
um let's see uh so
 
03:15:01.349 --> 03:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of there is a definition in rsa
 
03:15:02.550 --> 03:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
100 a
 
03:15:06.710 --> 03:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh of extra or special duty pay that it
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
means member work activities or details
 
03:15:10.950 --> 03:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
for which the employer bills or charges
 
03:15:13.269 --> 03:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
another entity in whole or in part for
 
03:15:15.429 --> 03:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
the work activities or detail provided
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
so again this is a
 
03:15:19.349 --> 03:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
hiring law enforcement uh you know for
 
03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
tree cutting work you know on a busy
 
03:15:24.790 --> 03:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
street things like that and you know the
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
member or the retiree is paid by the
 
03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
employer but that you know it's it's
 
03:15:29.590 --> 03:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
through you know the phone company or
 
03:15:29.600 --> 03:15:31.030 align:start position:0%
through you know the phone company or
whoever's

03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
whoever's
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
authorizing the work so the only um
 
03:15:36.790 --> 03:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
question i had with the language of the
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
bill was it refers um
 
03:15:44.070 --> 03:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
to um special duty law enforcement
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
not extra special duty pay so just to
 
03:15:49.190 --> 03:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
clarify and from what the sponsor said
 
03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
that was his intention but that would be
 
03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
preferable to clarify that so
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
an employer couldn't create a class of
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
pay called special duty law enforcement
 
03:15:59.670 --> 03:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
just to get somebody out of the hours
 
03:16:01.510 --> 03:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
because there already is a definition of
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
detail in the statute so it would be
 
03:16:02.960 --> 03:16:03.750 align:start position:0%
detail in the statute so it would be
better

03:16:03.750 --> 03:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
in 2020 which is the last number
 
03:16:13.910 --> 03:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh year that we have data for with 374
 
03:16:16.630 --> 03:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
retirees working in police positions
 
03:16:19.510 --> 03:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
um some of them may do detail some may
 
03:16:19.520 --> 03:16:20.389 align:start position:0%
um some of them may do detail some may
not

03:16:20.389 --> 03:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
type of thing and to the question
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
someone asked
 
03:16:24.239 --> 03:16:25.349 align:start position:0%
someone asked
earlier

03:16:25.349 --> 03:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:16:26.630 --> 03:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
know if they have arrest powers or they
 
03:16:30.389 --> 03:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
can chase somebody who's you know
 
03:16:32.630 --> 03:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
driving by them at 120 or whatever that
 
03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's outside the retirement system
 
03:16:35.429 --> 03:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
purview so i never really did any
 
03:16:36.870 --> 03:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
research on
 
03:16:39.670 --> 03:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
um you know if they have full
 
03:16:41.349 --> 03:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
law enforcement powers but maybe there's
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
somebody here who can clarify that but i
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
can't answer that
 
03:16:47.110 --> 03:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
so i'd be glad to address any questions
 
03:16:48.309 --> 03:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
anybody has
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.910 --> 03:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr
 
03:16:53.920 --> 03:16:55.510 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr
carlin

03:16:55.510 --> 03:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
carlin
 
03:16:56.710 --> 03:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
could you
 
03:16:59.190 --> 03:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
tell me is the
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
site in the last on line seven of the
 
03:17:02.950 --> 03:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill is that
 
03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:04.469 align:start position:0%
bill is that
the

03:17:04.469 --> 03:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:17:07.590 --> 03:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
site in 100a that defines
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
the detail that you were just talking
 
03:17:11.190 --> 03:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
about or is there a different
 
03:17:13.269 --> 03:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
you just said 100a can you give us the
 
03:17:15.429 --> 03:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
specifications yeah the specific that is
 
03:17:17.429 --> 03:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
not that that that section of the
 
03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
statute specifically refers to the
 
03:17:23.110 --> 03:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
annual reporting by employers okay um
 
03:17:25.269 --> 03:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
all of the working after retirement it's
 
03:17:26.950 --> 03:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's grafted on to several
 
03:17:29.349 --> 03:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
different statues but the ex the
 
03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
definition of extra or special duty pay
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
is an rsa 100 a one
 
03:17:37.830 --> 03:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh section 32 32 and that was that was
 
03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
put in i think 2009 or so
 
03:17:43.269 --> 03:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:45.010 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is
 
03:17:45.010 --> 03:17:46.229 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is
[Music]

03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:17:50.070 --> 03:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
do you have any kind of estimate as to
 
03:17:51.269 --> 03:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
how many
 
03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
police officers
 
03:17:57.990 --> 03:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
who began before that july 1st 2011
 
03:18:01.030 --> 03:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
date are still on the job
 
03:18:02.790 --> 03:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
just a rough um
 
03:18:06.630 --> 03:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
trying to remember from last week's bill
 
03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:07.590 align:start position:0%
trying to remember from last week's bill
that

03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:18:07.600 --> 03:18:10.389 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:12.790 --> 03:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
about 1800 i think that there was that
 
03:18:14.950 --> 03:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
many yeah that still
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
they they i'm sorry they were in service
 
03:18:19.510 --> 03:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
prior to seven one of eleven so they're
 
03:18:21.910 --> 03:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
still working and still
 
03:18:24.229 --> 03:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
accruing detail pay is part of that comp
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
over base
 
03:18:27.269 --> 03:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
umbrella that we spoke about this
 
03:18:28.389 --> 03:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
morning on the
 
03:18:31.030 --> 03:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
other and one more follow-up
 
03:18:31.040 --> 03:18:32.309 align:start position:0%
other and one more follow-up
so

03:18:32.309 --> 03:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
if if a retiree
 
03:18:38.870 --> 03:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
came and worked those detail hours
 
03:18:40.480 --> 03:18:40.490 align:start position:0%
they could possibly be
 
03:18:40.490 --> 03:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
they could possibly be
[Music]

03:18:43.110 --> 03:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
what's the word deferring those on
 
03:18:47.990 --> 03:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
on the job officers who could be
 
03:18:49.590 --> 03:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
utilizing that
 
03:18:49.600 --> 03:18:50.389 align:start position:0%
utilizing that
time

03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:18:52.469 --> 03:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
towards their retirement
 
03:18:52.479 --> 03:18:53.190 align:start position:0%
towards their retirement
if

03:18:53.190 --> 03:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:18:55.590 --> 03:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you know detail hours
 
03:18:57.510 --> 03:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
are available to police departments it's
 
03:18:59.830 --> 03:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
the local authorities who decide who to
 
03:19:01.590 --> 03:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
assign them to and you know what what
 
03:19:03.510 --> 03:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
the needs are so i i couldn't
 
03:19:05.349 --> 03:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
specifically say yes or no to that i
 
03:19:06.309 --> 03:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't thank you i have enough
 
03:19:06.319 --> 03:19:11.590 align:start position:0%
wouldn't thank you i have enough
information

03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:16.229 --> 03:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:20.150 --> 03:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
if i were to calculate 352
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
hours per year
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
it ends up at on a 52 year week year
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's 26 hours a week correct
 
03:19:28.080 --> 03:19:30.150 align:start position:0%
it's 26 hours a week correct
so

03:19:30.150 --> 03:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
retirees are allowed to work up to 26
 
03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
hours a week
 
03:19:38.309 --> 03:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
without affecting their pension benefit
 
03:19:40.469 --> 03:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
yes is that correct yes and that was
 
03:19:44.150 --> 03:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
effective july 1 2011. that's when we is
 
03:19:47.830 --> 03:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
put into statute for 352 hours no that's
 
03:19:50.870 --> 03:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
the that 1352 took effect on january 1st
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
of 19 there was
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
previously there was a weekly limit of
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
32 hours a week that was put in in 11
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
and that was amended to make it an
 
03:20:01.990 --> 03:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
annual limit at a lower weekly average a
 
03:20:04.150 --> 03:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
few years back
 
03:20:04.160 --> 03:20:05.110 align:start position:0%
few years back
okay

03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:20:08.870 --> 03:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:08.880 --> 03:20:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
follow up i'm sorry
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
i know in my own time we have a whole
 
03:20:15.990 --> 03:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
pecking order of who gets plea police
 
03:20:18.389 --> 03:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
detail and is that a function of the
 
03:20:20.630 --> 03:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
municipality as opposed to some place in
 
03:20:23.190 --> 03:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
statute yeah i i don't know of any
 
03:20:25.910 --> 03:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
statutory governing that i
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
so i won't guess but you know it seems
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
like it will guess
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you it's a municipal
 
03:20:33.990 --> 03:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
the police department decides who gets
 
03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
the details
 
03:20:38.229 --> 03:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
and as was said they frequently ask
 
03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
around for neighboring towns if they
 
03:20:42.710 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
need a lot of people on the highway for
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
guarding utility trucks or whatever
 
03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
senator pearson and then go
 
03:20:52.630 --> 03:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
03:20:52.640 --> 03:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
so

03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:54.630 --> 03:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
during the
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
this period of time where
 
03:21:00.229 --> 03:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
in which we're discussing here
 
03:21:00.239 --> 03:21:01.190 align:start position:0%
in which we're discussing here
folks

03:21:01.190 --> 03:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
folks
 
03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
folks are retired so they're collecting
 
03:21:07.110 --> 03:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
a pension benefit
 
03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
while they're doing this they're
 
03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
3 13 52 maximum hours
 
03:21:13.830 --> 03:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
03:21:16.070 --> 03:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
or any of these special details
 
03:21:18.790 --> 03:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
is anything being taken out of their pay
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
to contribute into the system for the
 
03:21:24.550 --> 03:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
job that they are working on no no thank
 
03:21:24.560 --> 03:21:26.070 align:start position:0%
job that they are working on no no thank
you

03:21:26.070 --> 03:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative goalie and then schmidt
 
03:21:30.550 --> 03:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you man chair thank you marty for
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:35.830 --> 03:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
you made the statement earlier that you
 
03:21:35.840 --> 03:21:36.790 align:start position:0%
you made the statement earlier that you
were

03:21:36.790 --> 03:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:21:39.670 --> 03:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
unsure whether their special duties
 
03:21:40.950 --> 03:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
included law enforcement activities
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
isn't it pretty clear on line five that
 
03:21:47.910 --> 03:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
it states
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
any hours worked on special duty law
 
03:21:53.190 --> 03:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement would allow them
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
to provide law enforcement while they're
 
03:21:56.950 --> 03:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
03:21:58.630 --> 03:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
again not as a
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
lawyer it seems like it but there may be
 
03:22:03.349 --> 03:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
other statutes you know defining that
 
03:22:05.190 --> 03:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know in the public safety statutes
 
03:22:06.630 --> 03:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
that may
 
03:22:08.630 --> 03:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure you know that it's it's on
 
03:22:10.389 --> 03:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
its face yes
 
03:22:11.429 --> 03:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:13.670 --> 03:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:22:18.950 --> 03:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
so are we potentially opening any doors
 
03:22:22.229 --> 03:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:24.150 --> 03:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
you have to be an expert
 
03:22:25.990 --> 03:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
you're the only one
 
03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:26.790 align:start position:0%
you're the only one
to

03:22:26.790 --> 03:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
to recognize
 
03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
you're going down the wrong path here
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
to clarify i wouldn't call myself an
 
03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
expert i've just been around a while um
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
but you know the
 
03:22:40.630 --> 03:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences similar to the
 
03:22:40.640 --> 03:22:41.510 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences similar to the
bill

03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:22:43.630 --> 03:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
last week that would increase it to
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
1664. only to the extent that full-time
 
03:22:49.429 --> 03:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
positions are eliminated because there's
 
03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
more hours available to work for
 
03:22:53.349 --> 03:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
retirees this is limited to law
 
03:22:56.710 --> 03:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement detail pay
 
03:22:59.590 --> 03:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
again because all the hours are reported
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
as hours not broken out we don't know
 
03:23:04.309 --> 03:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
how many hours folks are working for
 
03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
that um you know for statistical
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
purposes that separate report contained
 
03:23:10.950 --> 03:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
in this bill could guide the legislature
 
03:23:12.950 --> 03:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
to look at down the road if if they seem
 
03:23:16.309 --> 03:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
to be any unintended consequences but
 
03:23:18.870 --> 03:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
follow it so i mean
 
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like they're doing a lot
 
03:23:20.880 --> 03:23:22.070 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like they're doing a lot
of

03:23:22.070 --> 03:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:23:24.150 --> 03:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
kind of what's called traffic detail
 
03:23:24.160 --> 03:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
kind of what's called traffic detail
here

03:23:24.760 --> 03:23:24.770 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:23:24.770 --> 03:23:26.070 align:start position:0%
here
[Music]

03:23:26.070 --> 03:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
civilians are hired to do this kind of
 
03:23:29.670 --> 03:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
thing in many cases
 
03:23:29.680 --> 03:23:30.389 align:start position:0%
thing in many cases
but

03:23:30.389 --> 03:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:23:33.030 --> 03:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
what you have to do is you have to know
 
03:23:35.990 --> 03:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
something about managing traffic which
 
03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
police are trained to do and
 
03:23:40.870 --> 03:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
and civilians learned how to do
 
03:23:40.880 --> 03:23:41.750 align:start position:0%
and civilians learned how to do
so

03:23:41.750 --> 03:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:23:44.309 --> 03:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't seem like really police
 
03:23:44.319 --> 03:23:45.590 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't seem like really police
work

03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:23:45.600 --> 03:23:46.550 align:start position:0%
work
like

03:23:46.550 --> 03:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:23:48.389 --> 03:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
where you have to know something about
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
police practices and policing
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:23:55.349 --> 03:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for my question and
 
03:23:58.469 --> 03:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
can we think in those terms and and then
 
03:24:00.150 --> 03:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
03:24:08.469 --> 03:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:11.269 --> 03:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that's a a question
 
03:24:11.279 --> 03:24:13.349 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that's a a question
but

03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
i i know i i wasn't i was about to say
 
03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
the same thing i'm not sure what the
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
question was it's you know that
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
there are no obvious unintended
 
03:24:22.950 --> 03:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
consequences that the retirement system
 
03:24:33.269 --> 03:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:35.269 --> 03:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
03:24:36.630 --> 03:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i
 
03:24:38.550 --> 03:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
actually have two very short questions
 
03:24:40.870 --> 03:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
the first i think i know the answer to
 
03:24:42.309 --> 03:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
and the second i think i'm really
 
03:24:43.590 --> 03:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
baffled on
 
03:24:45.990 --> 03:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
the the first is is
 
03:24:47.910 --> 03:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
what is the rationale
 
03:24:50.229 --> 03:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
behind placing a cap
 
03:24:51.670 --> 03:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
on the number of hours that can be
 
03:24:54.150 --> 03:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
worked in a nutshell as best you can in
 
03:24:55.750 --> 03:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
a nutshell it
 
03:24:59.190 --> 03:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
before 2011 uh the definition part time
 
03:25:01.750 --> 03:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
was anything less than full time so you
 
03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
could theoretically have folks working
 
03:25:06.309 --> 03:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
39 and a half hours a week collecting a
 
03:25:08.630 --> 03:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
full pension and essentially doing
 
03:25:10.229 --> 03:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
a position that we're not getting any
 
03:25:12.870 --> 03:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
contributions on that you know arguably
 
03:25:14.630 --> 03:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know should be a contributing uh
 
03:25:16.469 --> 03:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
position going forward so the
 
03:25:18.389 --> 03:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
legislature lowered that to a weekly
 
03:25:20.550 --> 03:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
limit and then adjusted it again in 2018
 
03:25:23.349 --> 03:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
but you know the the policy argument
 
03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
that i heard when these bills were being
 
03:25:26.790 --> 03:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
put forward is
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know you you know you could take an
 
03:25:30.630 --> 03:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
employer could go to an entirely
 
03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
part-time workforce you know if they
 
03:25:34.469 --> 03:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
were working you know 35 hours a week
 
03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's really part time in name
 
03:25:38.309 --> 03:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
only for most people at that
 
03:25:39.990 --> 03:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
level of hours and then not pay any
 
03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
contributions into the retirement system
 
03:25:42.710 --> 03:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
and those
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
liability costs would be spread among
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
everyone else in the system so that was
 
03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
sort of the impetus to to define a
 
03:25:51.110 --> 03:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
number of hours for retirees that was
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
truly part-time and part of the reason
 
03:25:56.710 --> 03:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
32 was brought up again in 2018 lowered
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
was under the affordable care act
 
03:25:59.990 --> 03:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
anything over 30 hours a week you
 
03:26:03.269 --> 03:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
qualify for health care anyway so that
 
03:26:04.950 --> 03:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
most employers had already moved to a
 
03:26:08.309 --> 03:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
lower uh weekly limit because of that
 
03:26:10.870 --> 03:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
outside of our statutes and my follow-up
 
03:26:12.150 --> 03:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
please please
 
03:26:13.670 --> 03:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
so i understand what the bill is trying
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
to do but why should these hours not
 
03:26:18.790 --> 03:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
count against that cap you know that's
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
that's a policy decision um if if
 
03:26:21.279 --> 03:26:22.870 align:start position:0%
that's a policy decision um if if
employers

03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
employers
 
03:26:23.750 --> 03:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:26:25.429 --> 03:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
who are using part-timers feel like
 
03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
there's not enough hours to get these
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
jobs done you know and they they could
 
03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
speak to you about you know the reason
 
03:26:32.469 --> 03:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
03:26:33.910 --> 03:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know i i
 
03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a reason for or against the
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
change um you know but it would be a
 
03:26:38.870 --> 03:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
policy decision
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
and obviously employers reached out to
 
03:26:43.830 --> 03:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor on that uh but
 
03:26:45.349 --> 03:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer for that one
 
03:26:48.309 --> 03:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:50.150 --> 03:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
representing fellows
 
03:26:52.790 --> 03:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um let me just go through a
 
03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
scenario so
 
03:26:57.190 --> 03:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
we'll see if i understand
 
03:26:58.830 --> 03:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on here
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
suppose a police officer
 
03:27:04.630 --> 03:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
retired in 2017
 
03:27:04.640 --> 03:27:05.590 align:start position:0%
retired in 2017
with

03:27:05.590 --> 03:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:27:08.630 --> 03:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know whatever 30 years of service
 
03:27:08.640 --> 03:27:09.670 align:start position:0%
you know whatever 30 years of service
and

03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:13.190 --> 03:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
he's receiving his retirement payment
 
03:27:14.469 --> 03:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
under this
 
03:27:16.950 --> 03:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
he could be working
 
03:27:19.429 --> 03:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
26 hours a week
 
03:27:21.910 --> 03:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
plus he could in in when and when he
 
03:27:24.389 --> 03:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
earned his retirement those hours
 
03:27:27.510 --> 03:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
special duty was included in that yes it
 
03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
was so his retirement was based on his
 
03:27:31.750 --> 03:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
regular hours plus any special duty
 
03:27:34.469 --> 03:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
hours he had so now he could be working
 
03:27:38.309 --> 03:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
part-time he could be working 26 hours
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then he could be working another
 
03:27:44.229 --> 03:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
15 special duty hours
 
03:27:47.190 --> 03:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
which wouldn't count if we passed this
 
03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
and he could actually he'd be taking
 
03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.469 --> 03:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
yes a short answer is yes i don't know
 
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
how often that would occur but yes yes
 
03:28:04.389 --> 03:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:06.550 --> 03:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
03:28:08.870 --> 03:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh following a question
 
03:28:10.950 --> 03:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
of one of members here
 
03:28:13.670 --> 03:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
how many hours can a retired police
 
03:28:13.680 --> 03:28:15.030 align:start position:0%
how many hours can a retired police
officer

03:28:15.030 --> 03:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
officer
 
03:28:17.830 --> 03:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
can work on duty
 
03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
on detail i'm sorry
 
03:28:21.990 --> 03:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
well it it's there's no specific limits
 
03:28:24.070 --> 03:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
on detail right now for retirees it's
 
03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
any hours worked whether it's you know
 
03:28:27.910 --> 03:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
for the law enforcement agency or the
 
03:28:27.920 --> 03:28:28.790 align:start position:0%
for the law enforcement agency or the
town

03:28:28.790 --> 03:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know or you know or detail it's
 
03:28:35.670 --> 03:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
the total is 1352 hours in a year
 
03:28:36.870 --> 03:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
and again this is only for a
 
03:28:39.269 --> 03:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
participating employer obviously learned
 
03:28:41.190 --> 03:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
for there are no non-member law
 
03:28:43.349 --> 03:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement outfits but a retiree could
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
work full-time in another career and
 
03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
collect a pension and that's okay it's
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
this limit is for
 
03:28:50.830 --> 03:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
working for a participating
 
03:28:53.030 --> 03:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
employer they could also work full-time
 
03:28:55.190 --> 03:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
for the police and lowell representative
 
03:28:58.950 --> 03:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:01.110 --> 03:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and oh my goodness okay so i
 
03:29:04.710 --> 03:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
almost forgot my question um it's but a
 
03:29:04.720 --> 03:29:06.389 align:start position:0%
almost forgot my question um it's but a
currently

03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:29:08.950 --> 03:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
a current police officer who's not
 
03:29:08.960 --> 03:29:10.309 align:start position:0%
a current police officer who's not
retired

03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
retired
 
03:29:13.110 --> 03:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
can work as many detail hours as they
 
03:29:15.030 --> 03:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
wish so there's
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:21.510 --> 03:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
employee it's only on the retired
 
03:29:23.030 --> 03:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
employee correct
 
03:29:25.190 --> 03:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
yeah there's there's no limit on how
 
03:29:27.750 --> 03:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
many hours an active group two member
 
03:29:31.030 --> 03:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
could or any member could work uh detail
 
03:29:33.990 --> 03:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
anybody who joined the retirement system
 
03:29:36.150 --> 03:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
on or after seven one of eleven that
 
03:29:37.750 --> 03:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
detail pay doesn't count towards the
 
03:29:39.990 --> 03:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
pension anybody who is in the system and
 
03:29:41.590 --> 03:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
before that date and still active you
 
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
know they do that does go towards their
 
03:29:45.750 --> 03:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
pension calculation but there's no limit
 
03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
on the hours
 
03:29:49.110 --> 03:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:29:50.710 --> 03:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
president o'brien
 
03:29:52.550 --> 03:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:29:54.150 --> 03:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr collins for taking a
 
03:29:54.160 --> 03:29:55.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr collins for taking a
question

03:29:55.510 --> 03:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:29:58.389 --> 03:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
what concerns me with this well
 
03:30:00.309 --> 03:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
they are a police officer they have to
 
03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
meet certain qualifications
 
03:30:03.429 --> 03:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
whether it be
 
03:30:05.429 --> 03:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
target range shooting
 
03:30:07.269 --> 03:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
other different things physicals and
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
stuff like that but once a person is
 
03:30:09.680 --> 03:30:11.429 align:start position:0%
stuff like that but once a person is
retired

03:30:11.429 --> 03:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
retired
 
03:30:13.830 --> 03:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
they're basically out of the system
 
03:30:14.710 --> 03:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
do you
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
know of anybody who would get hired
 
03:30:18.469 --> 03:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
under this situation
 
03:30:20.550 --> 03:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
does the police department have any
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
standards for these particular people to
 
03:30:25.030 --> 03:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
meet the qualifications because i
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
imagine some of this why wouldn't it be
 
03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
anybody off the street i think they want
 
03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
somebody with a gun
 
03:30:34.229 --> 03:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
and if that is the case are they meeting
 
03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
the qualifications that they would as a
 
03:30:38.469 --> 03:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
police officer
 
03:30:40.389 --> 03:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
nothing under the retirement system law
 
03:30:42.630 --> 03:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
governs that i am aware just from past
 
03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
bills that there are there are full-time
 
03:30:47.830 --> 03:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
and part-time certification for police
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
officers through police standards and
 
03:30:50.870 --> 03:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's different
 
03:30:53.190 --> 03:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
levels of qualification for a full-time
 
03:30:56.630 --> 03:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
certification versus a part-time
 
03:30:59.110 --> 03:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:31:01.110 --> 03:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know you know and i i don't know
 
03:31:03.269 --> 03:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
specifically whether a town could call
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
someone law enforcement or they need to
 
03:31:04.800 --> 03:31:05.910 align:start position:0%
someone law enforcement or they need to
have

03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
them you know have the sort of requisite
 
03:31:09.269 --> 03:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
certification from police standards i
 
03:31:10.950 --> 03:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow up with that being said
 
03:31:14.950 --> 03:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
and very well explained but just to make
 
03:31:14.960 --> 03:31:16.469 align:start position:0%
and very well explained but just to make
sure

03:31:16.469 --> 03:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
in other words the new hampshire
 
03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
retirement system would just take it
 
03:31:22.229 --> 03:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
that this person is retired and working
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
under this without any knowledge whether
 
03:31:27.030 --> 03:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
they met that particular qualifications
 
03:31:28.710 --> 03:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's the responsibility of the
 
03:31:28.720 --> 03:31:31.269 align:start position:0%
that's the responsibility of the
employer

03:31:31.269 --> 03:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:31.279 --> 03:31:32.229 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:31:32.229 --> 03:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other questions mr
 
03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
carlin so you're off the hook for this
 
03:31:43.040 --> 03:31:44.309 align:start position:0%
carlin so you're off the hook for this
one

03:31:44.309 --> 03:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:31:57.990 --> 03:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:59.510 --> 03:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chairman members of
 
03:32:00.950 --> 03:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
the committee again for the record my
 
03:32:02.790 --> 03:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
name is arthur beaudry i represent the
 
03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state permanent
 
03:32:06.389 --> 03:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
firefighters retirement association and
 
03:32:09.030 --> 03:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
we are here in opposition of house bill
 
03:32:09.040 --> 03:32:10.550 align:start position:0%
we are here in opposition of house bill
1549

03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
1549
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons that we were in
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
opposition of house bill 1079 last week
 
03:32:15.600 --> 03:32:16.469 align:start position:0%
opposition of house bill 1079 last week
um

03:32:16.469 --> 03:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
if it walks like a duck and quacks like
 
03:32:21.670 --> 03:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
a duck it's a duck um you can change the
 
03:32:21.680 --> 03:32:22.550 align:start position:0%
a duck it's a duck um you can change the
names

03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
names
 
03:32:25.349 --> 03:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
in manchester uh where i come from
 
03:32:27.910 --> 03:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
um they have auxiliary police officers
 
03:32:30.710 --> 03:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
they have full uh arrest rights and they
 
03:32:33.670 --> 03:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
carry a weapon and but they uh fall
 
03:32:37.110 --> 03:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
under the 1300 hour rule
 
03:32:39.190 --> 03:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
so you can change this name to anything
 
03:32:39.200 --> 03:32:40.070 align:start position:0%
so you can change this name to anything
but

03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:32:42.630 --> 03:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
our concern is when the municipal
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
association comes in and says they're in
 
03:32:45.670 --> 03:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
in support
 
03:32:47.590 --> 03:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
of having part-time workers to save
 
03:32:49.510 --> 03:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
money but then they come in on other
 
03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
bills and say that the system is broken
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
and it's unfunded liability is out of
 
03:32:54.239 --> 03:32:55.269 align:start position:0%
and it's unfunded liability is out of
control

03:32:55.269 --> 03:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
control
 
03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
well this plays into it because if you
 
03:32:58.630 --> 03:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
don't have money going into the system
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
to invest
 
03:33:01.670 --> 03:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
the unfunded accrued liability will
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
never get paid off so
 
03:33:06.550 --> 03:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
if these individuals like to continue to
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
keep working they can keep working as a
 
03:33:10.710 --> 03:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
full-time police officer
 
03:33:13.349 --> 03:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
they don't have to retire and go work as
 
03:33:15.910 --> 03:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
an auxiliary or as a what they would
 
03:33:18.630 --> 03:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
call a special duty law enforcement i
 
03:33:20.469 --> 03:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
question personally
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
why would they
 
03:33:23.830 --> 03:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
want somebody other than a
 
03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
police officer that could actually have
 
03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
arrest rights if that's the case you
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
could hire
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
a traffic company that would go out and
 
03:33:33.110 --> 03:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
take care of traffic for probably half
 
03:33:35.590 --> 03:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
the cost that they would be charging
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
the police officers so
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
i would assume that they would want a
 
03:33:41.670 --> 03:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
police officer that has arrest rights
 
03:33:41.680 --> 03:33:42.469 align:start position:0%
police officer that has arrest rights
and

03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
has the powers to to
 
03:33:47.110 --> 03:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
keep keep the public
 
03:33:49.750 --> 03:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
at bay so i will answer any questions
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
but those are the reasons why we are
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to it and
 
03:33:55.349 --> 03:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
it may be small but it does impact the
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
system and we truly want to get the
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
system into 100
 
03:34:00.630 --> 03:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:34:02.309 --> 03:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
03:34:03.830 --> 03:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
03:34:08.790 --> 03:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
so my understanding
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking of again my my friend
 
03:34:13.349 --> 03:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
that i've been talking to a lot
 
03:34:15.590 --> 03:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
that is the police officer
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is if you're a
 
03:34:21.030 --> 03:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
full-time police officer
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to say you know i'm
 
03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
not working christmas day i'm not
 
03:34:26.469 --> 03:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
working after
 
03:34:28.469 --> 03:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
you know nine o'clock at night
 
03:34:28.479 --> 03:34:30.070 align:start position:0%
you know nine o'clock at night
whereas

03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
one of the questions asked is well why
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
would you retire or you don't have to
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
retire so if you retire of course you
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
can say
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
no i'm not working christmas day or i'm
 
03:34:40.710 --> 03:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
not working on tuesdays
 
03:34:42.309 --> 03:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
so is that correct that if you're
 
03:34:44.309 --> 03:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
full-time you pretty much have to work
 
03:34:46.790 --> 03:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
when you're told you're going to work
 
03:34:46.800 --> 03:34:48.229 align:start position:0%
when you're told you're going to work
versus

03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
versus
 
03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
i can explain that as a firefighter
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
because we have very limited um
 
03:34:56.870 --> 03:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
special duty but that is that's pretty
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
much voluntary you go on a list and they
 
03:35:01.030 --> 03:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
pick off a list you're not mandatory to
 
03:35:03.510 --> 03:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
go because i i know
 
03:35:04.870 --> 03:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
that they have when they don't have
 
03:35:07.110 --> 03:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
enough police officers in manchester
 
03:35:08.870 --> 03:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
they they go and hire the county
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
sheriffs to come in and take over
 
03:35:12.389 --> 03:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
because they don't have enough police
 
03:35:15.190 --> 03:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
officers volunteering to do the work so
 
03:35:16.710 --> 03:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
to answer your question at least in
 
03:35:18.630 --> 03:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
manchester i believe it's
 
03:35:21.110 --> 03:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
not mandatory it's it's you're on a list
 
03:35:22.870 --> 03:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
and they pick off the list for whatever
 
03:35:24.550 --> 03:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
details you want
 
03:35:26.710 --> 03:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
but it's not a mandatory thing if they
 
03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
can tell you to work your eight-hour
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
shift if they don't if a police officer
 
03:35:32.550 --> 03:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
calls in sick i'm assuming they can say
 
03:35:35.190 --> 03:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
hey you got to cover that shift but to
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
tell you you've got to go out and follow
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
a tree company around because they're
 
03:35:41.110 --> 03:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
cutting trees down i don't believe they
 
03:35:47.349 --> 03:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
person goalie
 
03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:35:57.750 --> 03:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
you've been around here long enough as
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
we've discussed a number of hours that
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
should be worked
 
03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
after retirement
 
03:36:06.630 --> 03:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
and we've had
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
it continue to go down
 
03:36:11.349 --> 03:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
do you believe
 
03:36:14.070 --> 03:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:16.150 --> 03:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
either or the number of hours per week
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
or a set number per year or do you think
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
a set number per week should suffice
 
03:36:22.229 --> 03:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
having the hours per year
 
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
i think the week would be better and i
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
as i testified on house bill 1070 79
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
at least
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:36:35.830 --> 03:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
school board member i saw firsthand
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
teachers and principals working
 
03:36:37.680 --> 03:36:38.790 align:start position:0%
teachers and principals working
full-time

03:36:38.790 --> 03:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
03:36:41.750 --> 03:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
um under under the law because it was at
 
03:36:44.710 --> 03:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
the even at 32 hours they only work
 
03:36:47.670 --> 03:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
seven seven hour days five days a week
 
03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
so they could pretty much work full-time
 
03:36:51.269 --> 03:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
and claim
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
that uh you know it's part-time work so
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
i would
 
03:36:58.150 --> 03:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
see the hours a week would be better and
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
again reduce it from less than 30
 
03:37:04.229 --> 03:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
because under the affordable care act um
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
30 hours above is considered full time
 
03:37:07.920 --> 03:37:08.630 align:start position:0%
30 hours above is considered full time
so

03:37:08.630 --> 03:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:11.830 --> 03:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
as i stated again in house bill 1079
 
03:37:14.070 --> 03:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
we would like to see 20 hours a week
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:37:24.150 --> 03:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
mr beaudry if we did it by the hours
 
03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
though how would you um
 
03:37:29.110 --> 03:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
manage the let's just take the police
 
03:37:32.309 --> 03:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
details for example the um
 
03:37:35.190 --> 03:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
seasonality of the work in the summer
 
03:37:38.710 --> 03:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
i mean again
 
03:37:41.830 --> 03:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
these departments and
 
03:37:43.269 --> 03:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
one of the departments that used to come
 
03:37:45.190 --> 03:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
before when we've been dealing with this
 
03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
03:37:49.269 --> 03:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
committeeman goalie had mentioned this
 
03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
has been going on for decades but
 
03:37:52.710 --> 03:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
hampton beach they say in the summer
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
they need a lot of a lot of police
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
officers well if they know that they
 
03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
should start working ahead of time
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
to get those police officers
 
03:38:02.710 --> 03:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
so they have enough to accommodate what
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
their needs are
 
03:38:06.070 --> 03:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
they have basically a whole year to do
 
03:38:06.080 --> 03:38:07.590 align:start position:0%
they have basically a whole year to do
that

03:38:07.590 --> 03:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:10.630 align:start position:0%
that
so

03:38:10.630 --> 03:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:38:14.469 --> 03:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
so as as the budget committee chair for
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
my town
 
03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
i would be very remorse if my police
 
03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:19.670 align:start position:0%
i would be very remorse if my police
department

03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:38:19.680 --> 03:38:20.710 align:start position:0%
department
hired

03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
hired
 
03:38:23.429 --> 03:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of officers in the summer
 
03:38:24.830 --> 03:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
and then had
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
them not
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
needing them in the winter
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying full-time people i'm
 
03:38:32.550 --> 03:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
saying podcast oh okay all right i'm so
 
03:38:32.560 --> 03:38:33.269 align:start position:0%
saying podcast oh okay all right i'm so
sorry

03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%

anyway thank you that's okay i
 
03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
understand to get there
 
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
get steamed up about it
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
season that seasonal work is
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
the main reason that we chose to make it
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
an annual limit so that a person could
 
03:38:52.550 --> 03:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
work full time in the summer and then
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
take the winter take off the rest of the
 
03:38:54.720 --> 03:39:00.790 align:start position:0%
take the winter take off the rest of the
year

03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:04.550 --> 03:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
i don't have any cards is there any
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
other person who would like to testify
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i'm going to close
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
and our next hearing is at two
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
i have a question of the chair man i'm
 
03:39:28.710 --> 03:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
sure it has nothing to do with this this
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
bill but if you look at today's agenda
 
03:39:34.550 --> 03:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
you see
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
well that's right it refers to a whole
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of bills that ain't on the list
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
for today
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any one of them i
 
03:39:51.750 --> 03:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
so when when are the i have in special
 
03:39:57.750 --> 03:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
interest in one of the bills which is
 
03:40:00.309 --> 03:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh 1552
 
03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's on the 31st at
 
03:42:51.830 --> 03:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:51.840 --> 03:47:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:03.840 --> 03:59:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:59:39.830 --> 03:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:39.840 --> 04:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon we are going to open the
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
the committee recognizes representative
 
04:03:32.319 --> 04:03:36.950 align:start position:0%
the committee recognizes representative
mcguire

04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
committee i'm carol mcguire representing
 
04:03:43.750 --> 04:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
merrimack district 29 the towns of
 
04:03:46.229 --> 04:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
allenstown epsom and pittsfield
 
04:03:49.110 --> 04:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
and house bill 1563
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
came out of my experience on the
 
04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
decennial commission on the pensions
 
04:03:53.760 --> 04:03:55.269 align:start position:0%
decennial commission on the pensions
where

04:03:55.269 --> 04:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:03:55.279 --> 04:03:57.030 align:start position:0%
where
we

04:03:57.030 --> 04:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
essentially agreed that a
 
04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
regular cost of living increase for the
 
04:04:04.150 --> 04:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
too expensive to plan for
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
best practices from private industry
 
04:04:20.550 --> 04:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
it signs up
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
members new new hires
 
04:04:26.070 --> 04:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
into the deferred compensation plan
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
which is a tax advantage savings plan
 
04:04:30.560 --> 04:04:31.830 align:start position:0%
which is a tax advantage savings plan
and

04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:34.389 --> 04:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
at a two percent rate and then it
 
04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
automatically escalates everyone in the
 
04:04:37.120 --> 04:04:38.229 align:start position:0%
automatically escalates everyone in the
system

04:04:38.229 --> 04:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:04:38.239 --> 04:04:39.590 align:start position:0%
system
by

04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
or 25 dollars if they're on the dollar
 
04:04:47.520 --> 04:04:49.670 align:start position:0%
or 25 dollars if they're on the dollar
rate

04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
rate
 
04:04:52.950 --> 04:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:56.469 --> 04:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
and so what this does is it
 
04:04:56.479 --> 04:04:57.910 align:start position:0%
and so what this does is it
lets

04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
lets
 
04:04:57.920 --> 04:04:59.510 align:start position:0%
lets
employees

04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:05:03.189 --> 04:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
save for their retirement tax advantaged
 
04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:13.510 --> 04:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
because many people as turned out have
 
04:05:16.309 --> 04:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
if they get to retire and they don't
 
04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
have any significant savings on of their
 
04:05:19.920 --> 04:05:20.790 align:start position:0%
have any significant savings on of their
own

04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:05:22.870 --> 04:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
or they enrolled in the
 
04:05:24.870 --> 04:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
deferred compensation plan at five
 
04:05:26.150 --> 04:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
dollars a week
 
04:05:28.389 --> 04:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
and 30 years later they're retiring and
 
04:05:30.150 --> 04:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
they're still putting in five dollars a
 
04:05:32.790 --> 04:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
week which is
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
better than nothing but not as good as
 
04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
it could have been
 
04:05:39.110 --> 04:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
and many people just don't bother to
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
sign up
 
04:05:43.269 --> 04:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
so this automatically signs them up
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
escalates it
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
but with the caveat that if any person
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
wants something else and
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
tells the system that they're exempt so
 
04:05:53.439 --> 04:05:55.189 align:start position:0%
tells the system that they're exempt so
if

04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:05:58.870 --> 04:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
their their free choice is what
 
04:06:00.630 --> 04:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
sets the limits
 
04:06:02.710 --> 04:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
this just changes the default to be
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
contribute at a at a modest level to
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
start and then escalating to a fairly
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
substantial one
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:18.550 --> 04:06:18.560 align:start position:0%

it's purely
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary yes and follow-up
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
and this bill makes it mandatory
 
04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
correct well you you always be signed up
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
if you choose you can
 
04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
sign yourself back out
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
you can sign yourself back out yes
 
04:06:50.950 --> 04:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
without a sorry without a penalty yes
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
without penalty and without a
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
an alternative plan
 
04:06:54.880 --> 04:06:55.830 align:start position:0%
an alternative plan
correct

04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:06:58.319 --> 04:06:59.590 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
representative

04:06:59.590 --> 04:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
the the you don't need an alternative
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
plan this applies to state employees
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're already covered by the defined
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
benefit pension this is a supplement
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
just to clarify a few things make sure i
 
04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
understand it when you say it's
 
04:07:18.389 --> 04:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
mandatory it's mandatory that
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
that they be included in the plan unless
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
they opt out but that's if the employer
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
chooses to offer it at all is that
 
04:07:27.030 --> 04:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
correct yes the basic bill is mandatory
 
04:07:29.189 --> 04:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
for state employees
 
04:07:29.199 --> 04:07:30.550 align:start position:0%
for state employees
for

04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
towns and so forth that enroll their
 
04:07:35.189 --> 04:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
employees in
 
04:07:37.830 --> 04:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
this plan which is allowed may adopt
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:44.149 --> 04:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
so as i understand it
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
the money put into this
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
retirement account
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
is just from the employer the employee
 
04:07:51.990 --> 04:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
does not contribute
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
is that correct no it's the other way
 
04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
around it's all from the employee the
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
employer at least the state does not
 
04:07:58.399 --> 04:08:00.550 align:start position:0%
employer at least the state does not
contribute

04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
04:08:00.560 --> 04:08:01.590 align:start position:0%
contribute
okay

04:08:01.590 --> 04:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:05.590 --> 04:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
nothing bars them from contributing but
 
04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
as of yet they have not never yet chosen
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:15.279 --> 04:08:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:08:16.710 --> 04:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:08:18.800 --> 04:08:19.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
so

04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:20.000 --> 04:08:21.510 align:start position:0%
so
as

04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
as a state retired state employee
 
04:08:27.750 --> 04:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
even though it was like 35 years ago i
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
remember when i first started work they
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
told me about the the deferred comp plan
 
04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
right off the bat
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
and you know made it clear that you know
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
it was optional and you could put your
 
04:08:39.510 --> 04:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
money in or not
 
04:08:43.349 --> 04:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
i think one of my concerns
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
one concern is that
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
i think that when state employee i'll
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
just speak from the perspective of state
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
employees when
 
04:08:53.349 --> 04:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
when they have to put seven percent of
 
04:08:53.359 --> 04:08:54.149 align:start position:0%
when they have to put seven percent of
their

04:08:54.149 --> 04:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:08:57.429 --> 04:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
their salary into the retirement system
 
04:08:57.439 --> 04:08:59.269 align:start position:0%
their salary into the retirement system
to

04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:09:03.030 --> 04:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
require them to put another percentage
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
into another system
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then with the automatic escalation
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that a lot of employees are fi
 
04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
are hired at the lowest labor grade and
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
they frequently get
 
04:09:17.349 --> 04:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
a step increase after one year and then
 
04:09:19.990 --> 04:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
they could get a cost of living increase
 
04:09:22.630 --> 04:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
that same year it seems to me that
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
there's a potential like in three years
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
they can be right up to that maximum
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
seven percent and so i'm
 
04:09:31.830 --> 04:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
in that case that's that's a good thing
 
04:09:31.840 --> 04:09:33.670 align:start position:0%
in that case that's that's a good thing
right

04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:09:36.229 --> 04:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
unless they're so highly paid that they
 
04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
reach the irs limit before then
 
04:09:42.149 --> 04:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm just wondering if if you gave
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
some consideration
 
04:09:47.429 --> 04:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
to the fact that when young people
 
04:09:49.110 --> 04:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
start work
 
04:09:50.710 --> 04:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
that one of the first things they might
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
want to do is buy a house and to put
 
04:09:55.349 --> 04:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
their money into this system
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
and once you put it in you can't take it
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
out without a penalty
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
that that might not be in their best
 
04:10:01.680 --> 04:10:02.550 align:start position:0%
that that might not be in their best
interest

04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's correct and that's why
 
04:10:06.389 --> 04:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:10:08.870 --> 04:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
clearly specifies in several places that
 
04:10:11.110 --> 04:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
if they opt out of the system or they
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
opt out of the automatic escalations
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
they're out
 
04:10:17.349 --> 04:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
there's no question about it
 
04:10:19.110 --> 04:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
and and to be honest
 
04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
in my experience in the private sector
 
04:10:23.429 --> 04:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
the same thing troll holds true most
 
04:10:23.439 --> 04:10:24.469 align:start position:0%
the same thing troll holds true most
people

04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:10:26.229 --> 04:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
most young people starting a job don't
 
04:10:30.070 --> 04:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:30.080 --> 04:10:31.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
just to clarify when you say out
 
04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
then they're out of
 
04:10:39.189 --> 04:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
contributing more to the system but
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
their money's in there and once it's in
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
the deferred comp until you get to
 
04:10:45.990 --> 04:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
retirement age isn't there a penalty to
 
04:10:49.510 --> 04:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
get your money out of that system um
 
04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
i believe there's that there is a
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
penalty if you
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
unless you leave state employee or
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
something like that you mr downing is
 
04:10:58.469 --> 04:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
here i can answer that and that in
 
04:11:01.269 --> 04:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
detail i'm not up on on it
 
04:11:01.279 --> 04:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
detail i'm not up on on it
um

04:11:03.030 --> 04:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:05.189 --> 04:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
but yes it's it is
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
hell is the same as if you put it into a
 
04:11:12.870 --> 04:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
an ira or whatever it's
 
04:11:15.030 --> 04:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's money put aside and you can choose
 
04:11:16.469 --> 04:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
you can choose not to do so if you think
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%

my problem with this bill though is
 
04:12:31.269 --> 04:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
number one
 
04:12:34.389 --> 04:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
the mandatory amounts
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
when i started
 
04:12:38.550 --> 04:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
i wasn't making very much money and so i
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
was glad that
 
04:12:43.110 --> 04:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
i could get in for just the five dollar
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
per paycheck
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
entry fee if you will representative
 
04:12:49.110 --> 04:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
schuett is there a question
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
04:12:51.439 --> 04:12:52.790 align:start position:0%
yes okay
but

04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:55.110 --> 04:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
i question the
 
04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
automatic increment increases
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
my own circumstances changed about
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
halfway through my employment
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
my husband passed away and
 
04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
suddenly all the bills fell on my one
 
04:13:09.680 --> 04:13:10.950 align:start position:0%
suddenly all the bills fell on my one
salary

04:13:10.950 --> 04:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
salary
 
04:13:13.750 --> 04:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i think it do you not agree that it
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
should be up to the employee
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
to decide how much they can afford
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely and that's why the employee's
 
04:13:25.750 --> 04:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
decision overrides any default this just
 
04:13:28.469 --> 04:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
sets the defaults what happens if
 
04:13:31.349 --> 04:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
if you don't care or you don't
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
make an effort to change it so
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
half a percentage point of your raise
 
04:13:37.920 --> 04:13:39.349 align:start position:0%
half a percentage point of your raise
is

04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know not you can live with that
 
04:13:43.030 --> 04:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
because it only applies when you're
 
04:13:44.630 --> 04:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
getting a
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
um a regular raise it's not
 
04:13:48.239 --> 04:13:49.910 align:start position:0%
um a regular raise it's not
the

04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
the system is
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
is such that
 
04:13:55.030 --> 04:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
when there's a general raise for all
 
04:13:55.040 --> 04:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
when there's a general raise for all
employees

04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:14:00.309 --> 04:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
the the the rates would be increased
 
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
and the dollar amount 25 dollars per pay
 
04:14:03.040 --> 04:14:04.070 align:start position:0%
and the dollar amount 25 dollars per pay
period

04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:14:05.910 --> 04:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
i thought that was fairly low if you
 
04:14:08.229 --> 04:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
think five dollars up is is more
 
04:14:09.990 --> 04:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate i'm
 
04:14:12.149 --> 04:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not prepared to i don't know how
 
04:14:14.389 --> 04:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
many people are
 
04:14:16.550 --> 04:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
deducting fixed dollar amounts rather
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
than a percentage of pay
 
04:14:19.680 --> 04:14:20.830 align:start position:0%
than a percentage of pay
thank

04:14:20.830 --> 04:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:14:20.840 --> 04:14:22.550 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:14:27.429 --> 04:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:14:31.110 --> 04:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the past history
 
04:14:33.110 --> 04:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire retirement system
 
04:14:33.120 --> 04:14:33.830 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire retirement system
and

04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
i kind of like the the basic idea of
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do but let's look
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
04:14:46.469 --> 04:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
we took what an employee in group two
 
04:14:47.990 --> 04:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
was paying nine and three-quarter
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
percent raised it up to 11 point
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
something percent
 
04:14:55.670 --> 04:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
we also changed the ull rules to
 
04:14:55.680 --> 04:14:58.389 align:start position:0%
we also changed the ull rules to
municipalities

04:14:58.389 --> 04:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay and that's coming in from them
 
04:15:02.309 --> 04:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to make this
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory to the employees
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
in other words you got to take the
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
earnable income that they currently have
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
make it mandatory to contribute to
 
04:15:15.429 --> 04:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
something that should have been already
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
that wasn't
 
04:15:19.510 --> 04:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
in the past this is not actually related
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire retirement system
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
it is a completely independent system
 
04:15:26.229 --> 04:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's more like a
 
04:15:28.870 --> 04:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
when when i was working i had both a
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
defined benefit pension and a 401k
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
and i contributed to both of them
 
04:15:36.550 --> 04:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
the pension is as you know defined
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
benefit pensions are it's fixed
 
04:15:42.239 --> 04:15:43.510 align:start position:0%
benefit pensions are it's fixed
the

04:15:43.510 --> 04:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:46.469 --> 04:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
401k money has been
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
invested fairly well and i'm living
 
04:15:51.030 --> 04:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
quite comfortably thank you
 
04:15:54.870 --> 04:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
so and i and after listening to stories
 
04:15:56.950 --> 04:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
about people that as i said put in five
 
04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
dollars a week forever
 
04:16:02.229 --> 04:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
and you know kind of regretted it
 
04:16:04.870 --> 04:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
i i said well this is what
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
the research in the private sector says
 
04:16:09.670 --> 04:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
is the best thing to do to help people
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
safe make it easy for them to save
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
and if they have other arrangements or
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it or whatever
 
04:16:20.309 --> 04:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
fine they're out that's that's their
 
04:16:23.110 --> 04:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
business but it just makes it easier for
 
04:16:23.120 --> 04:16:24.389 align:start position:0%
business but it just makes it easier for
them

04:16:24.389 --> 04:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
ah thank you and you know i totally
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
agree with you because i was an active
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
participant in what we call the d comp
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
program and i'm glad that i did
 
04:16:36.790 --> 04:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
04:16:39.349 --> 04:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
like others have brought up again
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
looking yeah to me you do have to look
 
04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
at collectively other things have
 
04:16:44.399 --> 04:16:45.429 align:start position:0%
at collectively other things have
happened

04:16:45.429 --> 04:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:16:48.149 --> 04:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
and now to come on with this the money
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
got to come from somewhere and that's
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
definitely well the point is that if you
 
04:16:55.590 --> 04:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
want to save if any person wants to have
 
04:16:59.910 --> 04:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
some money of their own when they retire
 
04:16:59.920 --> 04:17:00.790 align:start position:0%
some money of their own when they retire
why

04:17:00.790 --> 04:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
it should be in a tax-deferred
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
retirement plan
 
04:17:07.110 --> 04:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
for as long as possible just
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
to avoid giving a third of it to the
 
04:17:11.590 --> 04:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
feds i mean that's that's only common
 
04:17:11.600 --> 04:17:12.469 align:start position:0%
feds i mean that's that's only common
sense

04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:17:14.309 --> 04:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
and most people
 
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
either particularly if they're young
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
when they start working they don't think
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
about it they don't worry about it you
 
04:17:23.110 --> 04:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
know they may sign up once when they're
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know filling out the forms at their
 
04:17:25.199 --> 04:17:26.389 align:start position:0%
you know filling out the forms at their
uh

04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:29.269 --> 04:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
orientation but
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
they don't think about increasing it
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
when their pay goes up
 
04:17:35.670 --> 04:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
and so if they do think about it
 
04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
more power to them let them do it but an
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
awful lot of people don't think about it
 
04:17:43.830 --> 04:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you madam chair
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:17:49.349 --> 04:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
just going further with
 
04:17:51.429 --> 04:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
someone who's in the same
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
type of situation that i was
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
if suddenly your income is dramatically
 
04:17:59.520 --> 04:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
if suddenly your income is dramatically
altered

04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
altered
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
what you need to spend it for
 
04:18:03.040 --> 04:18:03.830 align:start position:0%
what you need to spend it for
if

04:18:03.830 --> 04:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:18:07.110 --> 04:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
you feel that you can't afford
 
04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
any kind of increment increase
 
04:18:12.389 --> 04:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
after you get a pay increase then you
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
have to drop out of the system no you
 
04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
can drop out of automatic escalations
 
04:18:18.790 --> 04:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
and maintain your contribution at the
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
same level but you
 
04:18:23.110 --> 04:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
or you could drop out of being able to
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
go forward and and put in
 
04:18:28.550 --> 04:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
in the future sure you could
 
04:18:33.189 --> 04:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
the the system right now already allows
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
employees to

okay i'm i'm misinterpreting the
 
04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
language i guess then thank you

or if it's if it's written wrong i will

i
 
04:18:53.670 --> 04:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's been known to happen that and based
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.389 --> 04:19:00.399 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
04:19:02.399 --> 04:19:05.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.950 --> 04:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
i was
 
04:19:06.960 --> 04:19:08.229 align:start position:0%
i was
i

04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:19:10.710 --> 04:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're aware but just to check
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
that are you aware of the fact that when
 
04:19:16.469 --> 04:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
you get close to retirement age when you
 
04:19:18.550 --> 04:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
get close to age 65 if you have a
 
04:19:20.710 --> 04:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
deferred comp plan
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
that you can put a significant amount of
 
04:19:24.159 --> 04:19:25.030 align:start position:0%
that you can put a significant amount of
money

04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:19:27.269 --> 04:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
into that plan within like you know
 
04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
three three to five years if you haven't
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you haven't been putting in large
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
amounts all along
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
and that for some people that might be a
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
better arrangement
 
04:19:38.550 --> 04:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
actually the best arrangement is to put
 
04:19:40.469 --> 04:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
the money aside while you're young so it
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
has time to compound
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
but yes i am aware that you can put more
 
04:19:47.110 --> 04:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
in when you're older i think you can put
 
04:19:49.349 --> 04:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
more in when you're over 50
 
04:19:51.269 --> 04:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
not necessarily how close you are to
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
retirement it's based on calendar age
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
but and but those are already in the
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
plan there's a maximum limit that the
 
04:20:01.030 --> 04:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
irs sets and it goes up as you get older
 
04:20:01.040 --> 04:20:01.830 align:start position:0%
irs sets and it goes up as you get older
but

04:20:01.830 --> 04:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:07.349 --> 04:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't need to replicate the
 
04:20:09.990 --> 04:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
entire plan document with all the irs
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:14.720 --> 04:20:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:20:16.309 --> 04:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:20:16.319 --> 04:20:17.349 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:17.359 --> 04:20:18.309 align:start position:0%
um
i

04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to ask if don't you think
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
that some people might have the opinion
 
04:20:24.870 --> 04:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
that there are better ways to use your
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
money than to put it into a deferred
 
04:20:28.790 --> 04:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
comp which is mostly like mutual fund
 
04:20:30.070 --> 04:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
because there are if you get the timing
 
04:20:36.469 --> 04:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
right it's significant opportunities in
 
04:20:39.910 --> 04:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
stock to invest in stock for example if
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
you had bought some stock in march of
 
04:20:44.479 --> 04:20:46.550 align:start position:0%
you had bought some stock in march of
2019

04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
2019
 
04:20:49.510 --> 04:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of march of 2019 you might be
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
well have like three times as much as
 
04:20:51.600 --> 04:20:53.349 align:start position:0%
well have like three times as much as
you

04:20:53.349 --> 04:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
paid those for those stocks at this time
 
04:20:55.680 --> 04:20:56.550 align:start position:0%
paid those for those stocks at this time
i

04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know all the investment
 
04:21:00.550 --> 04:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
options under the plan but i believe
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
they do offer stocks you can ask the
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
director of the plan
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
he was here representative bailey
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
04:21:14.080 --> 04:21:14.870 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
um

04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:17.590 --> 04:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
i i like the plan i just i just had one
 
04:21:19.590 --> 04:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
kind of softball question for you how
 
04:21:21.189 --> 04:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
did you choose between
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
in and opt out
 
04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
that was due to
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
the literature about
 
04:21:27.760 --> 04:21:29.030 align:start position:0%
the literature about
nudging

04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
nudging
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
so that what it is is it it says that
 
04:21:36.309 --> 04:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of people won't take action so if
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
you have an opt-in system which is what
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
they have and have for quite a while
 
04:21:44.710 --> 04:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
only those who really
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
really care will bother to opt in
 
04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
if you have it opt out a lot of people
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
will not care enough to opt out
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
so they will save
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
regard despite themselves
 
04:21:59.429 --> 04:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up i guess mark a
 
04:22:02.550 --> 04:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
comment we have seen today some opt-in
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
things that were a problem right that
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
people weren't opting in as they should
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
04:22:16.399 --> 04:22:17.910 align:start position:0%
that is the
experience

04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the public and private sector
 
04:22:21.429 --> 04:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
is that if it's an opt-in plan for
 
04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
saving most people will not bother to
 
04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
opt in
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:28.710 --> 04:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative lucas
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um isn't it the case that if
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
somebody decides that they don't like
 
04:22:33.279 --> 04:22:34.229 align:start position:0%
somebody decides that they don't like
the

04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
investment options provided here they
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
could just as well
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
open up ira with fidelity or somebody
 
04:22:43.750 --> 04:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
and invest however they like rather than
 
04:22:46.710 --> 04:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
using this plan absolutely and that's
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
the point is that this is
 
04:22:51.050 --> 04:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
this is a default it's for the
 
04:22:51.060 --> 04:22:53.110 align:start position:0%
this is a default it's for the
[Music]

04:22:53.110 --> 04:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:22:55.750 --> 04:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
essentially the least common denominator
 
04:22:55.760 --> 04:22:58.830 align:start position:0%
essentially the least common denominator
thank

04:22:58.830 --> 04:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:03.269 --> 04:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.110 --> 04:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
are there any members from the public
 
04:23:14.309 --> 04:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
sing none we will close the hearing for
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
house bill 1563 i apologize madam chair
 
04:23:21.110 --> 04:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
i had thought the director of the
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
deferred compensation plan would be here
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i am going to
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
