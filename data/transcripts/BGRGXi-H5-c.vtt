00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
to accept the consent again
 
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 align:start position:0%

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.150 align:start position:0%
all right seeing nand those in favor
opposed

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
all right Senator gray you're in for
 
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
okay so then the next item is the board
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
all right so this is 2022 232 on license
 
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 align:start position:0%
and registration requirements
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
applications and fees the board did file
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
an amended conditional approval
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
um The Heading says revised conditional
 
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
approval but this is actually an amended
 
00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 align:start position:0%
it's not a revised
 
00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:55.850 align:start position:0%
it's not a revised
um

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 align:start position:0%
because it's the only second one that
 
00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 align:start position:0%
they submitted
 
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
the first comment on page six which is
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
also made on subsequent Pages 7 12 18 19
 
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
20 21 and 37 of the amended conditional
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
approval text has to do with the PLC
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
1002 and 300 rules once again this is
 
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
just an informational note to the
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee to keep this on your radar as
 
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
well as to track which boards are
 
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 align:start position:0%
actually citing to these rules so I
 
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
won't get into that comment to in-depth
 
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
the only other comment I had was on page
 
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
29 which is then repeated on page 36.
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
it's an unclear comment because it's
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
unclear of whether the board can request
 
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
an applicant's social security number on
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
an application to take a prerequisite
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
examination to be a social worker or a
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
marriage and family therapist
 
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.090 align:start position:0%
marriage and family therapist
um

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
RSA 161b colon 11 authorizes the
 
00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
collection of social security numbers
 
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
for any application applicant for a
 
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
professional license however this is not
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
for a license this is just to take the
 
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
exam so it seems unclear of whether or
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
not they actually have the statutory
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
good morning uh
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for holding the special
 
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
session I want to apologize for us
 
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
missing the last meeting
 
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.430 align:start position:0%
missing the last meeting
um

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the lplc uh
 
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
with me is attorney rakia medley and she
 
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
is the chief legal counsel for the board
 
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
side of oplc so it's interesting I
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
looked into the question based on
 
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
attorney ricard's comment and
 
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
there was a section let me grab my note
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
real quick
 
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
I identified to the the social security
 
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:56.780 align:start position:0%
number issues one of them is an nhp
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
30603 that relates to marriage and
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
family therapists I don't think we need
 
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
that number so I suggest we just strike
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
that piece from the rule okay glad to
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
um the social workers 30403 is a little
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
bit more complicated so the way that
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
works and this is done nationally is
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
that individuals come to the state for
 
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
recognition with the association of
 
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
social worker boards the aswb once they
 
00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
meet the the prerequisites the state
 
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
then gives them approval and the state
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
has to register those individuals with
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
the aswb and that allows them to sign up
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
for the examination
 
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
the and that's just the way it's done I
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
think it's done in something like 80
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
percent of the states as I was told
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
there is no way for applicants for
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
social workers to register with the aswb
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
independently without going through the
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
state so the state creates the account
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
then the individual goes and signs up
 
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
for the test and the information the
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
state provides is what the aswb uses to
 
00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
identify and make sure it's the same
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
person uh
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
I did print out the language of 161 b11
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
it says essentially for Social Security
 
00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
it says essentially for Social Security
numbers

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
of any applicant for a professional
 
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
license commercial drivers like license
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
occupational license or marriage license
 
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
so it is limited to those uses to
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
request Social Security numbers I I now
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
the question I think is for the gel car
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
I suppose how far do we want to extend
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
161 b11 and does this as a piece of the
 
00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
application for professional licensure
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
fall under that purview and I will point
 
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
out that in 2014 this is the current
 
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
rule there was a form approved by gel
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
car and the social security number is on
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:00.110 align:start position:0%
 
see

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
so the this test is required to become a
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
social worker correct
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
correct but the so but the social
 
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
security number is being used by the
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
test Bender or these the professional
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
association as an identifier
 
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
despite all uh
 
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
all protestations to the up to the
 
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.730 align:start position:0%
all protestations to the up to the
contrary

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
contrary
 
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
and and the test vendor is
 
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay sort of part of the process it
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
seems to you know getting licensed
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
and it's not ask for anywhere else in
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
the process is that correct
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you repeat the question
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
are you asking for the social security
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
number anywhere else in the process
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
add an initial application
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
isn't this the initial application well
 
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:16.019 align:start position:0%
that's why it's interesting because this
 
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
is approval that the board has to give
 
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
or the state has to give in order to
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
take the examination and passing the
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
examination is part of the initial
 
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
application process so the Nexus is
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
there it is tied to licensure in this
 
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.829 align:start position:0%
there it is tied to licensure in this
state

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:11:34.449 --> 00:11:34.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
all right would you care to make a
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
motion representative Lynn
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I would move to approve
 
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.730 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I would move to approve
yes

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't fees and Licensing fees
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
that was to which the attorney referred
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
about six weeks ago we heard that there
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
was work in progress to rectify that
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
where does that stand now uh we are
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
actually taking a very hard look at
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
licensing fees right now we met last
 
00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:11.579 align:start position:0%
week and we're implementing or two weeks
 
00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:14.339 align:start position:0%
ago time is meaningless and we're taking
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
a hard look at fees right now and um
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
when do you expect to have uh I couldn't
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
give you an affirmative answer right now
 
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative so in the um request to
 
00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:38.459 align:start position:0%
put this I'm having I like the
 
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
explanation about it says the applicant
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
social security number for the purpose
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
of Child Support Enforcement pursuant to
 
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 161 colon B so what I'm trying to
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
rectify that statement in relationship
 
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.870 align:start position:0%
rectify that statement in relationship
to

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
the application so I think this is a
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
holdover statute from one on the board
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
who's with HHS and essentially The
 
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
Authority there was to in individuals or
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
in cases where individuals weren't
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
paying child support it was a mechanism
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
the state could essentially revoke
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
licensure until back child support was
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
paid they can do the same thing with
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license I'm not familiar with
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
that statute but that's where it stems
 
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.230 align:start position:0%
that statute but that's where it stems
from

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
yes they threatened to take away your
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
license so you can't work until you pay
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear to be uh
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
logical but I believe it's it's
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
is it a federal requirement is that is
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
that where it sounds from I don't know
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's I'm I'm pretty sure it's a
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
federal requirement based on paying
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
child support
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
I think you're right I'm pretty sure
 
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
and I have a follow-up question so is
 
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.670 align:start position:0%
and I have a follow-up question so is
this

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
consistent with other applications that
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
yes most nearly all the professional
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
licenses ask for a social security
 
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
number and they mentioned this statute
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
or at least that it's for purposes of
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
Child Support okay thank you
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
director Morrow I don't think we have a
 
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
second yet
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:26.459 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what was the motion to approve
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
the rule as amended a second okay
 
00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor
 
00:14:39.889 --> 00:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
opposed no
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:51.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.569 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
um Professional Engineers I'll take the
 
00:14:59.290 --> 00:14:59.300 align:start position:0%
two together this is
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
2023-44 and
 
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
2023-116 44 is on ethical standards and
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
license surrender and 116 is on
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
continued status they both have the same
 
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
issue there are some comments around the
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
fees but I won't spend any time on that
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
the main issue is that the rules have
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
been expired since January of 2022 you
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
do have in your packet a memo from Tina
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
Kelly stating that for the first one for
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
the ethical standards and license
 
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
surrender she states that they have not
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
enforced the statute or they have not
 
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
enforced the rules and no disciplinary
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
action has been taken against
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers for violations to
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
the expired engineer 501 ethical
 
00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
standards she didn't submit that she
 
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
didn't submit a statement like that for
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
the next one one for 116.
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
in both of these Tina has submitted
 
00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339 align:start position:0%
revised conditional approval requests
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
they should be amended conditional
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
approval requests that's just an FYI for
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
your motion so both of them have amended
 
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
conditional approval requests associated
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
with them and that is the only issue is
 
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
good morning to go solsterhout for the
 
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
record oplc general counsel with me is
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
attorney Ricky and medley Council for
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
oplc as well
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
um so I did look into this there has
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
been no discipline from that board since
 
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.050 align:start position:0%
been no discipline from that board since
2019.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:32.060 align:start position:0%
2019.
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
additionally I checked there are
 
00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
statutory references uh particularly for
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
Eng 500
 
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
there is a RSA 310-a colon 22 which
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
essentially functions as a charging
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
statute so the board wasn't entirely
 
00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:51.019 align:start position:0%
without a mechanism by which to hold
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
licensees accountable
 
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
about the license renewals in the other
 
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
the license renewals I checked with the
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
head of Licensing yesterday as far as I
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
know there are no denials so under the
 
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
process too right 541a 29 and 29a we
 
00:17:10.809 --> 00:17:10.819 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
provide applicants with an opportunity
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
to cure
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
any defective applications and we
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
also if there are particular issues they
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
would have conversations with the board
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
in person sort of show cause hearings as
 
00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
far as I know to the best of my
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
knowledge there were no denials during
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
that time period
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh what about the fee is it statutory or
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
only in rule
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you repeat the question
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
the licensing fee for for continued
 
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.570 align:start position:0%
the licensing fee for for continued
status

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
the 1002s on the same issue
 
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
no no no but maybe I'm not understanding
 
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
my question is while this rule was
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
expired and you're renewing licenses
 
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
without denials are you collecting the
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
fee and if so is that fee defined in
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
statute or only in the expired rule
 
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
that's a really interesting question
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
that I do not have the answer for right
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
now I will have to check on that for you
 
00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:11.810 align:start position:0%
now I will have to check on that for you
okay

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm going to look at the
 
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
I believe it's
 
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of the board if I
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes I have a quick question
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
just do and do these rules at all
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
conflict with the upcoming changes that
 
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
were made in House Bill 655 for a
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
I would have to do a more thorough
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
reading of these particular rules I do
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
think there's something in the soil
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
rules that are on our radar where as of
 
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
October 3rd
 
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
the statute that it's referencing no
 
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
longer will exist so I'm not aware of
 
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
that situation here I would have to do a
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
closer reading and compare it to the
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
language at FCP 107 nothing caught my
 
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
attention when I was going through this
 
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
but I can't I can't say for sure yes or
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
no but I did I did identify something
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
have that answer you can email it to us
 
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
or absolutely that we have we just don't
 
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
cause ourselves yes thank you yes
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
um there is a 310 a21 does allow the
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
board to issue renewals and it does talk
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
about renewal fee in there
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
but it's not defined no it says the
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
board shall charge a 20 reinstatement
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
fee but it does not State how much that
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
fee is okay well this is this continued
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
status is just a normal renewal not a
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
reinstatement so
 
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:10.070 align:start position:0%
reinstatement so
correct

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
it is also the continued status is also
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
for renewals um it is cited as Authority
 
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:18.059 align:start position:0%
and in their appendix
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
so this is um part of the authority that
 
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
and they do have
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I'll have to double check the um the
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
the bill whether or not that was changed
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
but there is 310 A7 that does Grant the
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
director Morrow there have been
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
instances I know with the boards under
 
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
oplc where they have not collected fees
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
During the period of expiration but I
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
don't know what the circumstances are
 
00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.870 align:start position:0%
don't know what the circumstances are
here

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
foreign okay then I'd like to make a
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
motion that we approved the rule
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
with the information that we asked about
 
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.690 align:start position:0%
with the information that we asked about
the

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:13.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
Authority and also with a comment or
 
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.049 align:start position:0%
Authority and also with a comment or
assurance

00:21:20.049 --> 00:21:20.059 align:start position:0%
assurance
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
that the fees set in the rule have not
 
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
been collected while the rule was
 
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:31.010 align:start position:0%
been collected while the rule was
expired

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
oh second okay
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
any questions comments Senator gray um
 
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
my problem is with defeats in in the
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
collection of the fees during the
 
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
expiration period
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
the way you stated the rule I'm
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
don't know that I'm comfortable with
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
chairman Mike on I don't know if I'm
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that part of it right
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
now okay the oplc has reflected let me
 
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
use in the past but go on and and that's
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
where I would like to get in in the
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
motion is that if there is not statutory
 
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
approval that they refund the
 
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:16.820 align:start position:0%
the fees any fees collected
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
stating in that way makes it clearer for
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
me that they have an obligation to a to
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
find out and B if they were you know
 
00:22:26.159 --> 00:22:27.409 align:start position:0%
find out and B if they were you know
without

00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:27.419 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh so you know if you will modify that
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
then I can support that I I would agree
 
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
the the intent is that if there is not
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
explicit statutory Authority for the
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
feed and the expired rule can't be used
 
00:22:47.649 --> 00:22:47.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
just make a comment about that I guess
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
the thing that I'm that troubles me
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
about this is
 
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
who's complaining in other words if I I
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
certainly could agree that if somebody
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
who got their you know who renewed their
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
license was charged with fee and there
 
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
was no Authority and that person said
 
00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
wait a minute I want my money back
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely I have no problem with that
 
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.950 align:start position:0%
absolutely I have no problem with that
but

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
I'm I am a little troubled with the idea
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we are now gonna
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
without a complaint from somebody taken
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
upon ourselves to say
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
um no
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know if you collected the fees
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't I don't think that
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
there's some suggestion that anybody was
 
00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
acting in bad faith and so if they
 
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
collected the fees
 
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
and they shouldn't have
 
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
and nobody's complaining I'm I'm not
 
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
troubled by that thank you
 
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn I'm complaining
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
because we have a very clear statutory
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
statement that an expired rule cannot be
 
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.029 align:start position:0%
statement that an expired rule cannot be
enforced

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
if the amount of the fee is specified
 
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
only in the rule then they have no
 
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
authority to charge that amount rather
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
than one dollar or ten thousand dollars
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's why if they are so
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
if the board is so careless doesn't let
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
their rules expire we need to shake them
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
up a bit and say
 
00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:12.539 align:start position:0%
you know you don't have the authority to
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
charge these fees even though you you
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
did the work well except my my only
 
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
problem with that is that so now what
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is we're going to give
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
the board more work to do to refund to
 
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.299 align:start position:0%
you know to go about finding out who
 
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
they who they charge fees to and refund
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
the fees presumably that's not going to
 
00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:36.260 align:start position:0%
help the issue of their keeping up with
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
the you know not letting rules expire
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you completely they
 
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have let the rules expire I
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with that but
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're both saying but
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
at the same time a rule is a rule and
 
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
you can't give Authority I mean people
 
00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
cannot just unilaterally decide what to
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
do if the rule has been expired so I
 
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
just think if the rules expired and we
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
it can't be enforced but I agree that
 
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
they should refund the money and
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if it is a lot of work it
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
is a lot of work but it's also a
 
00:25:12.409 --> 00:25:12.419 align:start position:0%
reminder that these rules count for
 
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
something and I think that's the
 
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
important part I mean that's why that's
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
why we're here right we do all this work
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
because rules matter
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
so I think I I agree that the fear
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
should be even though and just because
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
no one's complaining doesn't make it
 
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.090 align:start position:0%
no one's complaining doesn't make it
right

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
well right may not be the right word but
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
yes and and as I recall the board of
 
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
Engineers was generating a significant
 
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.750 align:start position:0%
Engineers was generating a significant
Surplus

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
Surplus
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
because they're they have relatively few
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
complaints compared to some other boards
 
00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
complaints compared to some other boards
so

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
just a few comments one it is our
 
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:52.340 align:start position:0%
practice that if we uncover that we have
 
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
taken a fee without the authority either
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
statutory or enrolled we do issue
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
refunds just as a general practice
 
00:25:59.400 --> 00:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
refunds just as a general practice
um

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
foreign I also want to make it clear
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
that as an administrative function it
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the board issuing the
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
refunds it is actually an oplc function
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing it on their behalf but uh it
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
does it does make a difference and it it
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't interfere with their ability
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
to Draft rules going forward and I also
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if the gel car is aware of
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
this I think representative McGuire and
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation one time but when I
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
came on board essentially January of
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
last year one of the first things that I
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
did was go out three years and identify
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
every lapsed and lapsing a rule close to
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
expiration and now we do meetings twice
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
a year we do one in January we do one in
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
July to identify every rule that should
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
expire and the hopes is to get out in
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
front of the boards and give them enough
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
time to promulgate rules without them
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
lapsing I don't think that was happening
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
before I came on board but it's
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
certainly happening now so in the future
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
the goal is to have that number of
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
expired rules reduced to zero so we are
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
being proactive about that but it's a uh
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
it's a step we just started doing in the
 
00:27:11.289 --> 00:27:11.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
director moral and I um we were just
 
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
discussing we don't think that you could
 
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.409 align:start position:0%
discussing we don't think that you could
put

00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:18.419 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
um a a demand if you will on the
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
condition where additional condition
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
that the um that the oplc refund the
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
fees but what you could do is you could
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
postpone this one and have them report
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
back you would need a waiver the the
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
deadline on it is September 19th so a
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
couple of days before the meeting but
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
that is an option you could do that as
 
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
well for this one
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
or you could do an objection and give
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
all right in that case I'd like to move
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
to object to the rule on the basis that
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
it was being enforced
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.289 --> 00:28:02.299 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
yes it's been second and comments
 
00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:08.330 align:start position:0%
yes it's been second and comments
questioned

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
aye opposed no okay I put us by may I
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
ask a clarifying question we were
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually looking at Eng 500 and 400 no
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
just 400 we were just at 400 all right
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I thought yes no they just
 
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:24.380 align:start position:0%
moved on yeah
 
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
500 I believe I don't think you had
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
emotion on that one yet
 
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh 20 23 44.
 
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:37.100 align:start position:0%
is there a second okay
 
00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:39.059 align:start position:0%
representative Higgins Phillips second
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
did before me okay good move
 
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh any comments or questions on the
 
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
ethical standards
 
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor
 
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.669 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor
aye

00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
aye
 
00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:51.409 align:start position:0%
aye
opposed

00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:51.419 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
all right so we've approved one objected
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
so the next item on the agenda is
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
2023.49 with which has to do with the
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
board of natural scientists and this has
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
to do with ethical standards
 
00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:16.220 align:start position:0%
um and just like uh 2023-44
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
these rules the only issue is that they
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
expired these rules expired back on
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
March 11 2019
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize my comment says March
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
18th it's actually March 11th
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and likewise uh Miss Tina Kelly did
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
file a memo with regard to the
 
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement of these rules stating that
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
no disciplinary action has been taken
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
against she put professional engineer
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
but it should be a professional natural
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
scientist for violations to the expired
 
00:29:53.889 --> 00:29:53.899 align:start position:0%
soil 500 ethical standards involuntary
 
00:29:56.409 --> 00:29:56.419 align:start position:0%
certificate surrender rules
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
I also want to point out to the
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
committee that there is a statute RSA
 
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
310 95 that does list a very limited
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
what you could consider ethical
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
standards that are in the rules so those
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
could have been enforced under the
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority but it seems as
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
though they weren't enforcing any of
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
I believe you said there was something
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
continual status is applied to these
 
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.029 align:start position:0%
continual status is applied to these
rules

00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
I believe it was House Bill 655 that
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
goes into effect October 3rd
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
um these rules would fall under those
 
00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:48.350 align:start position:0%
um these rules would fall under those
changes

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
um just due to the statute of story
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me statutory Authority changing
 
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
under HB 655. ah would that change the
 
00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
rule it wasn't the soil rules it was the
 
00:31:00.899 --> 00:31:01.970 align:start position:0%
rule it wasn't the soil rules it was the
RAB

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
RAB
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that was my mistake I did
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
say soil uh Douglas officer oplc general
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
counsel for the record so the
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
so this rule will refer to the revised
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
Statute but they shouldn't change the
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
rule itself
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
I didn't identify any issues with this
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry but after you pointed it
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
out I did go into oh it falls under
 
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
there as well it has the same issues as
 
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't change anything though it
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
really shouldn't no
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
fine there were a lot large portions of
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
of the statue that would just change the
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
connections so yeah it would just have
 
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
to be the statutory Authority changes to
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
the new oplc statute
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
all right well that sounds like the
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
first book in October you'll be making
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
some minor editorial Corrections all
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
over the place
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:00.500 align:start position:0%
second second
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
any questions comments
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none those in favor
 
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
next is 20 23 50 which is the real
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
estate appraiser board once again these
 
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
are ethical standard rules that have
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
been expired these ones have only been
 
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:27.380 align:start position:0%
expired since February 2nd 2023.
 
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
2023 excuse me
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
and likewise there's also a memo to the
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
same effect saying that there was no
 
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action taken while these
 
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
rules were expired
 
00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
in this particular set of rules has more
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority however under
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
or say 310b18 a specifically stating
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
that the uniform standards of
 
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
professional appraisal practice ethical
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
and professional conduct standards
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
in effect at the time of appraisal shall
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
be the ethical and professional conduct
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
standards to be followed at the time of
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
the violation so they did have the
 
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority should they have
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
chosen to enforce but it seems as though
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
they just were not enforcing uh due to
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
the rules being expired which is also
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
time or perhaps a real estate appraisers
 
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
were behaving ethically or as far as far
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
as the board could tell
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:26.419 align:start position:0%
questions comments emotions
 
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
oh and I apologize this one did have a
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
conditional approval filed so does the
 
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.490 align:start position:0%
conditional approval filed so does the
motion

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:39.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:54.059 align:start position:0%
and more on the real estate approach yes
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
the next one also has to do with the
 
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
real estate appraisal board
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
um 2023-61. this one is on continued
 
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.509 align:start position:0%
um 2023-61. this one is on continued
statuses

00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
statuses
 
00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:07.220 align:start position:0%
and very similar to uh 116 for engineers
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
there was a conditional approval filed
 
00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:11.690 align:start position:0%
there was a conditional approval filed
however

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
these rules
 
00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
were previously expired they've been
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
expired since February 2nd of 2023 so
 
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
there may be some questions about
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement and then additionally there
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
are fees in these rules because it's the
 
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.490 align:start position:0%
are fees in these rules because it's the
renewal

00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
renewal
 
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.570 align:start position:0%
renewal
um

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
of these uh particular licenses so there
 
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
is a comment with regard to
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
that informational note on the fees but
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
additionally for this one I did want to
 
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
point out that there is also a board
 
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
rule RAB
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
306.01 which also contains a fee
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
schedule that includes a renewal fee so
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
that is a rule that will need to be
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
repealed if they want to continue with
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
the PLC fee so that there's no
 
00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
conflicting board rules is that rule
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
currently in effect it is okay yes so
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's why I want to bring to the
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
board's attention it's currently in
 
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
effect and therefore in conflict with
 
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:15.380 align:start position:0%
the oplc fee rule
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
additionally with this particular
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
proposal there is a comment with regard
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
on page one of the conditional approval
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
text regarding the license expiration
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
period which is something we have talked
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
about before the oplc says every two
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
years but this particular board has a
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
rule that says every two years on
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
birthday whereas the oplc's rules say
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
every two years at the date of issuance
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
but I believe the oplc has already
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
addressed this issue that if it expires
 
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
on your birthday it'll just continue to
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
expire on your birthday because that'll
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
naturally be two years
 
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
certificate or registration with these
 
00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:03.020 align:start position:0%
rules with regard to
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
appraisal management companies there is
 
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
a board statute that specifically says
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
that the registration will expire every
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
year from the date of issuance however
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
these rules have it expiring every two
 
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.630 align:start position:0%
these rules have it expiring every two
years

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
and there is a little bit more of a
 
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
unique situation as in these are not
 
00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
licenses so it's unclear of whether
 
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:27.020 align:start position:0%
they'll fall under the oplc's um
 
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.930 align:start position:0%
they'll fall under the oplc's um
310

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:28.940 align:start position:0%
310
 
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:33.140 align:start position:0%
a authority of renewing every two years
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
for licenses as this is just a
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
registration for management companies
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't seem as there's any new
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
legislation to address this specific
 
00:36:42.359 --> 00:36:45.109 align:start position:0%
legislation to address this specific
issue

00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:46.430 align:start position:0%
 
lovely

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
lovely
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
and um well
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's all with that point for that
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
point I have a couple more comments on
 
00:36:57.849 --> 00:36:57.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
panting at the bid to explain what he's
 
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
doing about about this I don't mean to
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
look desperate
 
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh Douglas sells or how general counsel
 
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
for oplc I think our interpretation is
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
that all
 
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
under 541a license is defined in the
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
state as any any permission required by
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
the state and that does include registry
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I think our interpretation is that
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
under the new language of 310 under 655
 
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
it would fall be captured and have that
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.450 align:start position:0%
okay questions
okay

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.829 align:start position:0%
okay
fine

00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
sounds like we ought to clean up the
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
statute so it doesn't say something
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
explicitly different though
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and then the final
 
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.730 align:start position:0%
um and then the final
um

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
comments that I have on this rule have
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
to do with the renewal form there is a
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between the
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
printout of the form as this form is
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
done on the oplc's portal so there's no
 
00:37:59.569 --> 00:37:59.579 align:start position:0%
physical paper copy of the form but they
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
did provide printouts but on page one of
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
the amended text it asks for the
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
sponsoring provider which is not
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
something that's requested on the portal
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
printout I did talk to Tina Kelly
 
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
regarding this discrepancy she stated
 
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
that they would be working with the IT
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
department to put that on once the rule
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
became was approved and then became
 
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.630 align:start position:0%
became was approved and then became
effective

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
which would be fine however this
 
00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:32.660 align:start position:0%
particular requirement the sponsor
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
sponsoring provider was in the previous
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
rules as well
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
um so it's unclear whether there was a
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
discrepancy at that time as well as the
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
rules are now expired that's not an
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing issue but something that
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
certainly should be fixed
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
um additionally on the printouts there's
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
no where to put an electronic signature
 
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
it seems as though once you submit the
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
application that is essentially your
 
00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.589 align:start position:0%
application that is essentially your
signature

00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
signature
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
and therefore you're certifying
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
um that the application was submitted to
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
the best of your knowledge the normal
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
language however
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
this particular certification statement
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
also states that by submitting this
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
application they are swearing under the
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
penalty of perjury
 
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
which is first off not in the rule text
 
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
so that's a discrepancy but additionally
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if the board has the
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
um have the applicant certify under the
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
penalties of perjury it's not explicitly
 
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
stated in any of their statutes that
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
they can require that or that any sort
 
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.829 align:start position:0%
they can require that or that any sort
of

00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
information provided would be subjected
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
to that it really should be under RSA
 
00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
6413 which is unsworn statements which
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
would be allowable under the statute of
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
sounds like the people writing the forms
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
are sloppy in their language in what
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:07.730 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
Douglas said to have general counsel
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
I think the issue is more complicated
 
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
than I would love to believe and I
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
missed that so but it is true that we
 
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
were waiting because it in order to
 
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
make those form changes that's an I.T
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
requirement it does take about four
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
weeks to make those modifications and we
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
would make those modifications upon
 
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
approval so I just want to confirm
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
um would that be an editorial request
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
change if we were to change the statute
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
to 641-3 and could we agree to do that
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
or do you think it's more substantive
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
I ask
 
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
um I I think that would be more
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
substantive especially because
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
um you even if you were to cite to 6413
 
00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:53.579 align:start position:0%
you would need that in the rule text
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's not in the rule text anywhere so
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
that's a discrepancy and because it's
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
outside of the best of my knowledge and
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
belief it has to be in the rule text so
 
00:41:04.089 --> 00:41:04.099 align:start position:0%
I would argue that that's not really
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
editorial it would be substantive but we
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
could certainly do an oral Amendment to
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval to say that
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's a change that will be added to
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
the rule text and then you could fix it
 
00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
um from the discussion that I'm hearing
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this one is another one
 
00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:24.859 align:start position:0%
either to continue or object to
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
because you know when you say you know
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
change and you say it's more substantive
 
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
than that further discussion needs to go
 
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:36.260 align:start position:0%
on uh what's the preference to either
 
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
object or to continue
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
um so certainly you could object to
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
these rules um based on that but also
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
just like 116 this has that fee
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
um where the fee discrepancies that was
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
talked about in the engineers 116 which
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
you had previously objected to on those
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
grounds so if that's the course the
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
committee wants to take they could
 
00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
certainly add that change as something
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen in the preliminary
 
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
in the final so we need to take a vote
 
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
on this is there any is are there any
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
more issues that we need to discuss
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
before we vote on the objection no that
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
was all for this proposal in that case
 
00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.130 align:start position:0%
was all for this proposal in that case
just

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on the objection
 
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
aye aye opposed
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
all right and the objection response can
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
all right moving on to the mechanical
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.730 --> 00:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
um so this particular proposal there was
 
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
an amended conditional approval filed
 
00:43:02.339 --> 00:43:03.349 align:start position:0%
an amended conditional approval filed
um

00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
this one has an informational note to
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
the committee at the top of page one
 
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.870 align:start position:0%
the committee at the top of page one
um

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
just to inform the committee and also as
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
a reminder to the board this board was
 
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
moved from the Department of Safety over
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
to the oplc
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
um within the last year or so and
 
00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:23.060 align:start position:0%
therefore their
 
00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
abbreviation for their rules is being
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
changed from saf MEC to just MEC
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
this particular proposal only has
 
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
various sections of 300 it's not the
 
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
entire chapter
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
so when the board goes to certify the
 
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
rules should they be approved and
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
adopted when they certify they need to
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
go through the entire chapter the entire
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
300s to change that on every single rule
 
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
that is something that can be done
 
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
editorally but it is something that
 
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
really needs to be done
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
additionally on this proposal on page
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
five of the conditional approval text
 
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
there's an unclear comment
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
um regarding
 
00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:11.109 align:start position:0%
um regarding
the

00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
requirements or
 
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.630 align:start position:0%
requirements or
um

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
one of the criteria that the board takes
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
into consideration of whether to Grants
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
a license to an applicant and that is to
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
determine if the applicant was mentally
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
or physically competent to practice
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
however the form doesn't have a lot of
 
00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the physical or
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
mental ability to practice that
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
particular profession so it's really
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
unclear how the board is going to make
 
00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
this determination with the lack of
 
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.370 align:start position:0%
this determination with the lack of
information

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
and additionally this was a comment that
 
00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
was made on the conditional approval
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
request that was before the board back
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
in 2015. at that time the committee did
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
approve the rule as written however this
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
is still an issue and if the committee
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
has any questions or wants that
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
addressed at this time they can still do
 
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.490 align:start position:0%
addressed at this time they can still do
that

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:03.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
and then finally
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
there is on pages 4 and 20 of the
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval text that
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
informational note regarding the fees as
 
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how they check physical or
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
mental capability from a form
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
particularly in online form where you
 
00:45:34.569 --> 00:45:34.579 align:start position:0%
can't see the shaky handwriting
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
do we do you have any information on how
 
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
I've never actually seen it happen uh
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
Douglas solster how oplc general counsel
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure how the board would
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
check on that I think it is intended to
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
be a little bit more flexibility giving
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
something that should happen during a
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
licensing term uh the individuals struck
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
by mental illness or some physical
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
handicap of some sort I don't know the
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
correct term but
 
00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
director Morrow
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
I certainly do not disagree with your
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
concern but I think this language has
 
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
been fairly standard in various boards
 
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
for a long time what their process is I
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
maybe it's something that needs to be
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.819 --> 00:46:49.130 align:start position:0%
 
has

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
other information you know on continuing
 
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.930 align:start position:0%
other information you know on continuing
applications

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
you know that they can look at
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
complaints etc etc so
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like this one is a
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
legislative fix that
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
oplc ought to come to us with something
 
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
that that you know talks about their
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
criteria uh and not necessarily try to
 
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
cram it into something that we would do
 
00:47:20.809 --> 00:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
today so yeah that's my opinion so and I
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
also just want to say that should this
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
had been a renewal perhaps there have
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
been other things to look at but just to
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
be clear this is for the initial
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
licensing so once again it's unclear how
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
they would gather that information for
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
an applicant who is applying for the
 
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
first time and hasn't been under the
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
board's jurisdiction before
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
um mechanical licensing board most of
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
those people are apprentices before they
 
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:47.540 align:start position:0%
get the full-fledged license so The
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
Apprentice supervisors reports
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
or complaints for their work as an
 
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.770 align:start position:0%
or complaints for their work as an
apprentice

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
apprentice
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
might be applicable
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
and again because there are
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
complications that's why it should be
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
some kind of a legislative fix that the
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
board comes to us or oplc comes to us
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
and and gives us some kind of
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
guidance that we can put into rule next
 
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.109 align:start position:0%
guidance that we can put into rule next
revision

00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
revision
 
00:48:15.119 --> 00:48:16.609 align:start position:0%
revision
okay

00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:18.980 align:start position:0%
but other questions comments
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative Baroda no
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
no anyone else
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
do we have a motion
 
00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:29.690 align:start position:0%
do we have a motion
proof

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
proof
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
could we add that the oplc come back to
 
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
us with information on that part of the
 
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh the application
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
that certainly could be a recommendation
 
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
a recommendation okay would that be
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
agreeable Senator as amended okay I'll
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
second then
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
anyone any further discussion comments
 
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.309 align:start position:0%
anyone any further discussion comments
questions

00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
aye opposed
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you that completes our agenda we
 
00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
will meet again on September 21st for
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
the regular meeting correct
 
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
yes okay uh just an additional piece of
 
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
information uh there were two bills that
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
affected 541a directly this session 358
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
and 266. I'm in the process of doing a
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
memo to all the agencies to make them
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
aware and I will send copies to the
 
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
yes both house bills
 
00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:35.809 align:start position:0%
yes both house bills
okay

00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
another question just an apology to the
 
00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
board for being late there there were
 
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
two accidents on Route four and one in
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
Rochester and a school bus driver that
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
didn't know that you're supposed to let
 
00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:50.819 align:start position:0%
traffic pass after you've built up and I
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
think I was 14th or 15th in line so
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
my apologize to the board for being with
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
tardy okay
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
trouble in that case we are adjourned
