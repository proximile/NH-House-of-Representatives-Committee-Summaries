00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
would have to be refunded then we're
 
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
also going to
 
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
hear from crochet
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
about the four items
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
that subtract from our revenue stream
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
such as
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
money going to dhhs or the l chip
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
primary history now that evolved
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we won't see many more of
 
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 align:start position:0%
those hopefully some of these will
 
00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.309 align:start position:0%
those hopefully some of these will
disappear

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
and then we want to talk with the dra
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
on the latest update on
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
finally representative romney wants to
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
and i think a senate bill
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh and on and on this book
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
on this bill that senate has which
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
also associated with one section
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
is almost word for word house house bill
 
00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.189 align:start position:0%
is almost word for word house house bill
565.

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
565.
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
so we'll start off as teresa rosenberg
 
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.070 align:start position:0%
so we'll start off as teresa rosenberg
here

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
teresa thank you for being here this
 
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.070 align:start position:0%
teresa thank you for being here this
morning

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much can you hear me yes
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
major and members of the committee
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh on your i think
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
your screen you may see carl heathfield
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
and kevin kennedy these are cpas that
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
i have brought that would love to talk
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
to you about
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
what they and there have done for their
 
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.830 align:start position:0%
what they and there have done for their
clients

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
clients
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
with the ppp um tax
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
and carl is from one of the largest cpa
 
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.350 align:start position:0%
and carl is from one of the largest cpa
firms

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
firms
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
in the state and kevin has a smaller in
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
smaller firms so i thought it was good
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
to have both
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
so you can see the treatment they have
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
they both their their companies have
 
00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.029 align:start position:0%
they both their their companies have
applied

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
applied
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
also robin abbott who is the executive
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
director of the cpa
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
society took a straw poll
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
over the weekend and carl and kevin can
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
give you results of that as well
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
so if you could um allow
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
carl and kevin in that would be great
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
because they are the ones who prepare
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
the returns
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
um i don't i wish i were that clever but
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
that was what i was going to ask you so
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
janine would you like kyle and kevin and
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
just did it thank you
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
i think or carl if carol and kevin are
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
um go ahead and start
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
yeah kevin do you want to start or
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
would you like me to no go ahead okay
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
um hi good morning everybody um my name
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
is carl hefield and i
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
as theresa just mentioned i'm with um
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh baker newman noyes uh we're
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm based out of the manchester office
 
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.790 align:start position:0%
i'm based out of the manchester office
um

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i also am uh i'm representing the
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
cpa society today as as
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh the co-chair of the their tax
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee along with kevin
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
kennedy um i i guess
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
maybe if you we could start by just um
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
getting the question on the table that
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
you would like us to address just so we
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
make sure we've
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're answering the questions that you
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
want to hear hear about
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
um maybe that's the best way to start
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
the real question is is our
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
business taxes are about 275 million
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
dollars ahead of plan this year
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
and since we hadn't passed senate bill
 
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.150 align:start position:0%
and since we hadn't passed senate bill
three

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
and the taxes in new hampshire were due
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
april 15th then those businesses that
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
received the ppp loans and this is about
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
25 000 of my best
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
would have to report this as income
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
and pay the taxes on it now
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
we would like to get a feeling is
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
did they do that and
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
and if we do pass senate bill 3
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
as is then we would see a lot
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
of requests for refunds
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
later on in the year when they
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
file their extension or whatever so
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's our issue
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
is to try to identify this
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
vocal money that we have that we had
 
00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
vocal money that we have that we had
anticipate

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
how much of that might be associated
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
with the ppp loans that
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh if we pass senate bill three
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to pay back
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
because if we don't do that people will
 
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.550 align:start position:0%
because if we don't do that people will
see

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
we have this money sitting here and the
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
natural thing for politicians today is
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
we've got money let's spend it
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
and we need to warn them uh
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
what the potential here is if we go one
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
way or the other
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
so that's the question so
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
i can uh provide a couple of comments on
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh the first is i i don't see that we'd
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
be able to quantify
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
that in any means just because there's
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
simply not enough data
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
but i think relative to some of your
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
considerations as to what this amount
 
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:39.220 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.389 align:start position:0%
might be
[Music]

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
the the ppp loans
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
are taxable in new hampshire based on
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
when the loans are forgiven and
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
a vast majority of people who received
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
ppp loans
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
were not forgiven as of 12 31
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
20 for various reasons um
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
and because of that it's unclear based
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
funds that were received how what
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
percentage of that is actually because
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
people were anticipating the taxation of
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
the ppp funds
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
or something else so
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
if indeed it does become non-taxable
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
the the overpayment amounts associated
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
are probably not clear simply because
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
people only would have paid and included
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
that amount to the extent that they were
 
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.990 align:start position:0%
that amount to the extent that they were
forgiven

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
and so so that's one issue
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
the other issue is is that payments
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
received i believe included
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
because they were unclear as to the
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
status of sb3
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
prepared extensions a large number of
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
extensions for their business clients
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
and on the premise that the amount would
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
be taxable
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
they included with their extension
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
payment a payment to cover
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
the amount that's taxable if it turns
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
out not to be taxable then
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
any overpayment associated with the 2020
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
return that was included in the
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
extension payment
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
would likely be carried forward to
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
subsequent payments or potentially
 
00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.629 align:start position:0%
subsequent payments or potentially
refunded

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
refunded
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
um so to the to the big question
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
quantifying it is not easy but
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
i think there are a lot of
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
considerations relative to
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
how the ppp funds actually are related
 
00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:31.829 align:start position:0%
how the ppp funds actually are related
to

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
that that excessive excess amount of
 
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.990 align:start position:0%
that that excessive excess amount of
revenue

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
and you started off by saying that
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
ppp loans that haven't been forgiven is
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
that because
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh the small business association just
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't caught up
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
with the paperwork and that these would
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
be forgiven because if you took out a
 
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
be forgiven because if you took out a
ppp

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
ppp
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
meeting certain requirements that you're
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
going to use at least 60
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
on wages and
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
and the rest of it to support uh
 
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.110 align:start position:0%
and the rest of it to support uh
maintaining

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
your uh employees
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
i think the reason that there's a lot
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
that haven't been forgiven is twofold
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
you may recall that the time period to
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
use the ppp funds were extended
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
and because of that people didn't
 
00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:33.910 align:start position:0%
and because of that people didn't
actually

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
utilize their funds or were in a
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
position to apply for forgiveness by the
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
end of the year because
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
certain conditions of the ppp fund
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
allowed you to
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
rectify say shortages and full-time
 
00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:45.910 align:start position:0%
rectify say shortages and full-time
equivalent

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
employee counts through the end of the
 
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.949 align:start position:0%
employee counts through the end of the
year

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
actually i think a larger part of the
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
reason forgiveness was not actually
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
applied for so it's not
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
the sba that's necessarily behind its
 
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.189 align:start position:0%
the sba that's necessarily behind its
people

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
hadn't actually applied for forgiveness
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
with their banks
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
partly because when the second round of
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
ppp funds became available
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
banks refocused their systems
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
to process the second draw payments and
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
many of them
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
shut down the ppp application
 
00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:18.069 align:start position:0%
shut down the ppp application
forgiveness

00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
forgiveness
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
process so people clients businesses
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't actually apply for forgiveness
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
because those portals at the banks
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
weren't available to them
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
so they could apply for ppp loans
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh knowing that they weren't going to
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
use them
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
to retain employees no they they applied
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
for the loans and used the funds
 
00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:41.030 align:start position:0%
for the loans and used the funds
appropriately

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
but the loan it's it the amount they
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
received is a loan
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire regulations it's a loan
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
until it's actually forgiven
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
and so based on the current law the ppp
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
funds are not considered taxable
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
until the loan is actually forgiven so
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
until the sba
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
agrees to forgive the debt it's a loan
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
on the books and not included in
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
state taxable income but they but they
 
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.189 align:start position:0%
state taxable income but they but they
knew

00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
knew
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
that they were applying that they use
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
these ppp
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
loans for maintaining their
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
their employees all right so they did
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
the right thing
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
so they know eventually uh
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible to have their
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
loans forgiven
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
in theory most most most businesses i i
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
believe use the funds appropriately and
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
expect to be forgiven if they haven't
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
been already
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case then
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
eventually if sb3 passes
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
and they had filed their returns paying
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
because they used current law they're
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
going to get that money back
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
for the amounts for the amounts that
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
were forgiven in 2020 for the 2020
 
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.390 align:start position:0%
were forgiven in 2020 for the 2020
return

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
return
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
if the loan is forgiven in 2021
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
um and sp3 does not pass then that
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
income would be included on their 2021
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
return of course i'm referring to a
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
calendar year return
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
right um
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
can i just add maybe just to help
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
clarify i
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
so i think what what we're saying and
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in our practice
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
is that um some ppp
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
recipients um had their loans forgiven
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
those taxpayers
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
filed most of them at least from what we
 
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.029 align:start position:0%
filed most of them at least from what we
can

00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know from what we've seen in our
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
practice we'd have filed extensions
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
because they weren't sure
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
what the final law was going to be on
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
ppp loans so they filed extensions
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
paid paid their extension payments as if
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
the ppp
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
loans were taxable and
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
if if sp3 passes as it is they
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
those uh those taxpayers will have an
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
overpayment that will either get
 
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
overpayment that will either get
refunded

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
refunded
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers that did not
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
apply for forgiveness in 2020 and are
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
applying for forgiveness
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
in 2021 will face the same
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
issue um next year so
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know if it's if it's still unclear
 
00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:35.029 align:start position:0%
you know if it's if it's still unclear
um

00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
they you know it'll be a next year issue
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
but the the impact for those
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
for those taxpayers who are who will
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
apply for forgiveness in 2021
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
won't be felt until um
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
you know around this time or the summer
 
00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:52.710 align:start position:0%
you know around this time or the summer
of

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
next um you know next year so 2022
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
so you know it i don't know what perc i
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't really tell you what percentage
 
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.110 align:start position:0%
couldn't really tell you what percentage
of

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have applied for forgiveness
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
in 2020 versus the percentage that
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
applied for forgiveness or will apply
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
in 2021 um
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
you know but it's but it's you know
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
that it's really those it falls into
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
those two
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
buckets okay before we open it up
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions since
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
a cert an amount of 270
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
about 275 million dollars above what's
 
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.350 align:start position:0%
about 275 million dollars above what's
anticipated

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
has the businesses that
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
remitted their taxes for tax year
 
00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:59.270 align:start position:0%
remitted their taxes for tax year
2020

00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
have done that well to produce the
 
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
have done that well to produce the
difference

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
has business has been that but you're
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
the accountants
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
you see this because we have to
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
determine is it just strictly due to
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
increase in business or
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
um they have to come back
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean my only response can be
 
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:35.990 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean my only response can be
somewhat

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
anecdotal but there certainly are
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
businesses that did well um
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
in spite of kovid um
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
and so you know some of i would expect
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
that some of those
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
um revenues are you know
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
because businesses generated profits or
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know paid um wages that generated
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
bet um and then
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know other many other businesses you
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
know were were negatively impacted
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
um by the situation and um
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
so it you know it's really hard to put a
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
number on that and and
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
and tell you what percent you know give
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
you percentages but
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
there there's certainly some um
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
you know some population of businesses
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
that had you know had strong
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
results in 2021 and and
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
um those those business taxes whether
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
they're bet taxes or bp
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
bpt taxes you know reflect those
 
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.190 align:start position:0%
bpt taxes you know reflect those
results

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative brownie
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
i kind of did but a lot of it's been
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
answered i think but
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
um first what percentage of the uh
 
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
would you would you guess of the filers
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
are calendar year filers
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
um is that is it a majority of the
 
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.070 align:start position:0%
um is that is it a majority of the
filers

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
yes yes most uh most businesses
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
are or the vast majority are calendar
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
year filers
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
um you know there certainly are fiscal
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
year filers
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
um but the you know
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
typically though i mean for for
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
for-profit businesses
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
um calendar year is the most prevalent
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
tax year
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and i don't know percentage-wise
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
but it's well over 50 percent
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay and then with the second and the
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
second wave
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
of follow-up mr chair um
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
that was just approved in the end of
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
december there's
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
the second phase of this that it ends in
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
may 31st
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh so what kind of guidance is going out
 
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:55.750 align:start position:0%
uh so what kind of guidance is going out
to

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
those again that wouldn't affect that
 
00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.029 align:start position:0%
those again that wouldn't affect that
would

00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
obviously affect uh filings for next
 
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:02.789 align:start position:0%
obviously affect uh filings for next
year

00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
is that safe to say yes
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
but in terms of what it uh but these
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
businesses are doing quarterlies
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
correct so how how would uh how would
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
that affect the quarterly payments
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
yeah um again it's it's sort of all over
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh all over the board depending on the
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
specific uh client situation or taxpayer
 
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.470 align:start position:0%
specific uh client situation or taxpayer
situation

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
most businesses um would base their
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
estimates on safe harbor or many of them
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
would base them on safe harbor so they
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
would really be basing their quarterly
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
estimates on their
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
2021 taxes or what they
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
what they presume their 2021 taxes to be
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
but not all taxpayers would be doing
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
that some would
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
project them based on what they expect
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
their 2022
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
results to be and um
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know that it would it would seem
 
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:04.870 align:start position:0%
you know that it would it would seem
that

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
if the current law is to include
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
um ppp forgiveness in
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire tax base uh that they
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
would be making that
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
assumption accordingly um and then
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
then obviously if sb3 passes and
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
those funds are not taxable they they
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
would be overpaid
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
and that would result in some future
 
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:30.870 align:start position:0%
and that would result in some future
refunds

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
or application of those overpayments to
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
um to future tax periods
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
and if i can add a little more
 
00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:41.029 align:start position:0%
and if i can add a little more
complexity

00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
complexity
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
the a lot of taxpayers actually pay
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
and they receive a credit against their
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
the ppp funds if they are taxable
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
apply to the business profits tax which
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
increase business profits tax
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
and if they have enough bet credit
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
reduces the bet credit or credit carry
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
again to add some complexity to it folks
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
may be simply
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
understanding what their bet
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility is based on their wages
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
and paying quarterlies based on that
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
and understanding that even if the bpp
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
the ppp funds are taxable for business
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
the result is really to eat into the bet
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
credit that they've got
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to increase their
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
overall taxes
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
i think i just wanted to clear something
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
up before my
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
real question on mr he
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
he failed on said
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
that they would be basing what they
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
will pay in quarterly estimates
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
this year on the 21 taxes did you mean
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
20 taxes
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
um yes i'm sorry 2020 yes they would be
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
basing them on their 2020
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
taxes uh for estimates that they're
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
paying in 2021 yes sorry about that
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
thanks um we get confused about these
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
things all the time
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
on the other uh you
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
do and do either of you represent um
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
water's edge on
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
corporations the huge majority of our
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
money comes from
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
just about 100 companies which are
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
mostly water's edge
 
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.350 align:start position:0%
mostly water's edge
and

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
consolid do consolidated returns
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering whether the cpa
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
society on has
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
members that are active in that area
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
or whether they're specialized firms
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
um well i i guess i can
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
answer and then kevin you can um
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know supplement my answer if if what
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
i say doesn't apply to your practice but
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
um for you know for our practice
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
um even though we are a large firm we're
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
probably not working with
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
those types of companies that you've
 
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:30.389 align:start position:0%
those types of companies that you've
described

00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
described
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
most of those are very large companies
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
represented by much larger national
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
firms than ours
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i so i don't know we we have we do
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
have many clients who file
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
combined new hampshire returns um
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
but um the amount that
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know of the top 100 taxpayers
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
um that you're referring to i don't know
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
if we represent any of those
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
um you know or you know very few of them
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
sure and i'll add on we we also file
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
unitary returns for our clients but
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
because of the size of my firm water's
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
edges is
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:35.590 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
ames

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you to both
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh of you for joining us to all three of
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
you i should say
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much um and so we're
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
we're uh puzzling through this situation
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
trying to understand
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
the impact of a of the proposed
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 change
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
and the impact
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
sort of has two aspects to it one is
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
on the state's revenues and that's
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
really what we've been talking about
 
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:15.820 align:start position:0%
and the other is on
 
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.430 align:start position:0%
and the other is on
[Music]

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
individual businesses and we haven't
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
talked so much about that
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
the revenue report that we just received
 
00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:30.950 align:start position:0%
the revenue report that we just received
from

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
dra for this month just ended
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
april had a huge
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
increase way beyond historical levels
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
way out of the norm and if you look at
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
the sub
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
categories that dra provides to us
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
the subcategory for extensions
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
is the one that really has the huge
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
increase and there's some sort of more
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
moderate increase in the estimates
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
so it's both looking both are looking
 
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.350 align:start position:0%
so it's both looking both are looking
forward

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
um well the age of the extensions is
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
really looking back
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
and making some some guesstimates
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
and this may you may not be able to
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
answer this but
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
could such a huge jump in revenues be
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
explained mostly or a major part
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
by what we're talking about here
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:44.060 align:start position:0%
well the current bbt
 
00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.669 align:start position:0%
well the current bbt
[Music]

00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
rule that may be changed by sb3
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
so the filings now would be on the
 
00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:53.750 align:start position:0%
so the filings now would be on the
assumption

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
or uh or end um
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
might it be that this huge jump reflects
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
the success of the very big businesses
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
in this time of covid and the high
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
profits that have
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh come to these big businesses and as i
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
say i may be asking too much of you but
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh if you could uh offer your
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
wisdom on that question i'm sure we
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
would all
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay um you know i think all i
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
can um
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
you know the what i can offer is that i
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
i would say that there were many many
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
more extensions filed
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
um for this past year than
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
historical at least that again that's
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
what i've seen in our practice and i
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
just in speaking with other cpas i
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's pretty consistent and not all of
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
those extensions
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
are because of ppp loans um
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
you know not all of those extensions are
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers that had ppp loans
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
forgiven in 2020
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
but there's just a lot more extensions
 
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.909 align:start position:0%
but there's just a lot more extensions
because

00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
while ppp is one reason that
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
companies extended um
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
they may have extended for a bunch of
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
other reasons i mean there were a lot of
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
changes over the last year
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
with the the cares act and with the
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up legislation
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
both for individuals and businesses
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
that have taken more time for
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
cpas and clients to sort out so
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of those you're seeing a
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
lot more extensions in general
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
some of those extensions um are related
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
to the ppp
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
um uncertainty um
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
but many of those extensions are just
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
all the other complexities and um
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know and extra time that's been
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's needed
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
to prepare um complete returns
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
so um i guess that's a long way to say i
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
think a lot of what you're seeing
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the data with respect to the
 
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.109 align:start position:0%
in the data with respect to the
extensions

00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
is it's not all ppp related it's
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
there's some of that but um a lot of it
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
is just
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
um taxpayers that extended um
 
00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:34.150 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons and um
 
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.430 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons and um
[Music]

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
you know i don't i don't know if the if
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's got
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
if the if the revenue numbers you're
 
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.230 align:start position:0%
if the if the revenue numbers you're
seeing

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
are because of large companies doing
 
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.750 align:start position:0%
are because of large companies doing
well

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
or better than expected
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
um i again i think it just it really
 
00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:53.109 align:start position:0%
um i again i think it just it really
depends

00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
depends
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis some did well
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
and some
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid i don't have much to add to
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh mr field's comments
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
um i agree extensions occurred for for a
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
number of reasons
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's unclear the percentage of
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
extensions that were filed by large
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
corporations and if those large
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
corporations who presumably received
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
larger ppp funds
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
had filed for forgiveness so the
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
amount of businesses the number of
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
businesses that applied for forgiveness
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
and included that on their extension or
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
their return
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
is certainly high but it's unclear in
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
terms of the dollar amounts
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
how that spread and if the larger firms
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
had the resources and the ability to
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
apply for forgiveness in 2020 and
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
received them
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
sooner than uh the vast number of small
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
businesses who
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
who didn't apply so again it's just more
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
more information to to
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
put in more complexity to the decision
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
as to what will be the ultimate effect
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i guess i would also just add
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
that very large businesses
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
um you know were not qualified for ppp
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
loans in the first piece
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
um you know and again it depends on
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
their industry and
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and there there are exceptions to
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
that but the
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
in general the very largest businesses
 
00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:21.589 align:start position:0%
in general the very largest businesses
um

00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify for ppp most very large
 
00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.510 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify for ppp most very large
businesses

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
always extend their returns just because
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
the returns are so complicated they need
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
all the extra time uh to prepare them
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
right okay uh a follow-up question
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah uh thank you
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
um so switching perspectives to the
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
business um the uh
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
federal rule uh it wasn't so clear when
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
we started out after the
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
first covet bill was passed by congress
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
but it became clear
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
in december the federal that the federal
 
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.190 align:start position:0%
in december the federal that the federal
rule

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
is that the loan the forgiven loan
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
proceeds are not um
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
are not revenue under the uh are not
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
taxable revenue
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
and um that deductions may be taken
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
so it's both both of those elements
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
and we're contemplating going to the
 
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.349 align:start position:0%
and we're contemplating going to the
federal

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
rule here there's an argument that
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's double dipping so to speak
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
you the loan
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
proceeds are excluded
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
expenses paid for with those loans
 
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.109 align:start position:0%
expenses paid for with those loans
nonetheless

00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
are deducted from other income
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
and my question to you is
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
if you can help us
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
understand the fairness
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
of doing it the federal way or doing it
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the current stateway which we're
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
struggling with that question too
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
and the there is a proposal we have a
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
pending amendment
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
before the committee to disallow
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
disallow to accept the federal
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
exclusion of the uh forgiven loan
 
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.030 align:start position:0%
exclusion of the uh forgiven loan
proceeds

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
proceeds
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
but to disallow the deduction of the
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
expenses that were paid for
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
forgiven loan and if you could comment
 
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.349 align:start position:0%
forgiven loan and if you could comment
on

00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
how why why is it fair
 
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:50.810 align:start position:0%
to our businesses to
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.589 align:start position:0%
to our businesses to
[Music]

00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
not allow the deduction
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
is that unfair i'm not sure i phrased
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
that exactly right but
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
so i i guess i'll have i guess my
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
response to that would be
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
um you know the society is is neutral on
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of fairness i think
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
philosophical or political question and
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
not really one that uh
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
that we're looking to take a position on
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
yeah okay i agree i i i would
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
um just add that if you
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
if um if the bill
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
is amended to exclude um
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
or to disallow deductions
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's really more confusing for that's
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
going to be more confusing for
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers than just not passing the bill
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
all together
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
in my opinion um i mean either way what
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
what you know it's just a way to
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
um to make the
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
ppp loan proceeds taxable you know
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
whether you included his income or
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
disallowed the deductions
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's the same it's the same result the
 
00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.309 align:start position:0%
it's the same it's the same result the
the

00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
forgiven amount becomes a taxable
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
cost to the business and i think
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
the disallowance of the expenses is a
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
more confusing
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
um avenue to do that
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
because um it's much less clear what the
 
00:40:35.359 --> 00:40:36.790 align:start position:0%
because um it's much less clear what the
timing

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
timing
 
00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:38.770 align:start position:0%
should be of that um
 
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:39.990 align:start position:0%
should be of that um
[Music]

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
recognition of the disallowed should it
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
go back to the 2020
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
year when the expenses were um
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
paid for or does that disallowance
 
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.430 align:start position:0%
paid for or does that disallowance
happen

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the year that the um loan is forgiven
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
you know we'd need more guidance i think
 
00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.270 align:start position:0%
you know we'd need more guidance i think
to

00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
for things to be clear so again we
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
you know we're neutral on the bill um
 
00:41:05.839 --> 00:41:06.550 align:start position:0%
you know we're neutral on the bill um
and

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't think i want to get into the
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
fairness question but i think
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's always important to try to um
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
at least keep things as clear and simple
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
no matter what the you know what the
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
ultimate result ends up being
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that that's very
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
helpful okay before i go to the next
 
00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.829 align:start position:0%
helpful okay before i go to the next
question

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.839 --> 00:41:34.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
and kevin do you represent the society
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
and did you take a vote that you'd be
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
or is that your own ferns
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
we we don't didn't take a a vote as a
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
society we
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
as a society we've um it's our policy
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
not to advocate one way or the other
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
for you know for a tax
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
increases or tax decreases we're
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know what we're trying to do and
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
what our mission is is to
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
um help explain how
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know impact uh taxpayers
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
and also you know if we do advocate for
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
anything as i just said we advocate for
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
clarity um and
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
to as much as possible simplicity to
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
um so that it's easy for taxpayers to
 
00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.630 align:start position:0%
um so that it's easy for taxpayers to
comply

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
comply
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
and it's clear as to what the rules are
 
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:39.750 align:start position:0%
and it's clear as to what the rules are
but

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not we don't as a
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
matter of policy and
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
i mean this has been voted on in general
 
00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:46.550 align:start position:0%
i mean this has been voted on in general
not

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
specific to every time we talk about
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
something but
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
um you know we we don't advocate for
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
increases in taxes decreases in taxes
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
um or you know new taxes
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're not going to
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
advocate one way or the other for that
 
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.109 align:start position:0%
advocate one way or the other for that
it's

00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's just the reporting and compliance
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
that we advocate for
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
um you know being as clear as possible
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
for our clients what you said is
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's much clearer to your clients
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
and yourselves if uh senator
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
bill three did not pass
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
because their client would get the ppp
 
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.510 align:start position:0%
because their client would get the ppp
loans

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
loans
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
and then they could and if they use it
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
for what
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
they apply for they're not going to pay
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
any taxes because
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's all deducted
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think the you know the
 
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.030 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think the you know the
amendment

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's been proposed to adds confusion
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
don't get deducted and
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
i mean right now so um
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
if if you're gonna amend sp3
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
um for that it would be simpler just to
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
not pass it at all
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
and allow the current law um
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's in place that the dra has already
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
issued guidance on
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
um to stand because we at this point we
 
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:28.790 align:start position:0%
um to stand because we at this point we
understand

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
the you know we understand how that
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
is gonna and we're at a point where
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh it could be the particle when
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's maybe trying to say
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
you gotta forget it and then if
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's the case in order to be balanced
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
we'd have to say for those that believe
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
it this way
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
is that then you can't deduct the
 
00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.829 align:start position:0%
is that then you can't deduct the
expenses

00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
if they go to the way of the political
 
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.030 align:start position:0%
if they go to the way of the political
winds

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
winds
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
but anyway we'll go to the next question
 
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.150 align:start position:0%
but anyway we'll go to the next question
miss

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
miss
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
ribson a major yes i have to leave in 10
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
minutes could i ask a question that i
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
think is clarifying before i go
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
i still can represent elementary thank
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
on i don't
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
thinking about the water's edge
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
on for on mr
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
hayfield on do you have any idea
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
on whether the subsidiaries
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the larger businesses on
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
were able to qualify for
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
ppp loans on their own
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
i've seen some indication of that
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
looking through who got a ppp loan in
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
lebanon but
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how whether that they were
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
very small
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
people those and they probably didn't
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
get good advice
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea what the advice
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
would be on that
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh well i do think i is your if your
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
question is do
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
um with subsidiaries of those larger
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
water's edge groups qualify for ppp
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
and did some of them receive them i i
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
think the answer is
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes in certain circumstances i think
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
um you know the general rule
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
that businesses over i think 300
 
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.550 align:start position:0%
that businesses over i think 300
employees

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
could not apply or qualify for ppp there
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
were exceptions to that and i think
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
some of those exceptions depended on the
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
industry so
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
i believe restaurants and and some
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
hospitality businesses
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
could qualify based on their
 
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.550 align:start position:0%
could qualify based on their
subsidiaries

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know situation and not not not have
 
00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.430 align:start position:0%
you know situation and not not not have
to

00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
sort of look at the larger group
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
um that they belong to
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
does does that answer your question so i
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
so yes i believe
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
some probably did qualify but and some
 
00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:13.030 align:start position:0%
some probably did qualify but and some
didn't

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay represents spellsbury
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
uh yes i think it's been very very
 
00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:25.109 align:start position:0%
uh yes i think it's been very very
interesting

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
commentary so far and
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
i by the way do not in any way disagree
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
with the notion that just
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
failing to pass sb3 it might be a
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
simpler and more direct route
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
my concern is that if there is a
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
political will to see sb3
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
go forward that the amendment may be
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
necessary and
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
did i hear you correctly to agree
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
in your comment uh i believe to
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative ames representative major
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
that it is essentially true
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
that all uh ppp loans
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
must be offset by qualified deductions
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
yes um so if in order to qualify for
 
00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:21.109 align:start position:0%
yes um so if in order to qualify for
forgiveness

00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
forgiveness
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
um they have to have used the loan
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
proceeds for
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
the various types of expenses that were
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
allowed under the program
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
most of those being wages but there were
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
some other expenses that were also
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
qualified and so then do you agree
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
that the the um necessary consequence of
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
that is that that portion
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
of their um revenue
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
attributable to the ppp alone uh
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i i i guess i'm kevin i don't
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
know if you had a
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
no i'm not sure i understand the
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
question but to the extent of ppp i'm
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
glad to rephrase it
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
all right well if i can offer a response
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
which may be the answer that
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
ppp funds a big piece of that were to be
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
used for wages and in some cases
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
it was all used for wages so to the
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
extent that wages were paid with ppp
 
00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.430 align:start position:0%
extent that wages were paid with ppp
funds

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
those wages will be included in the bet
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
calculation now if
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
the the issue is that
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
the sb3 is passed without an amendment
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that it follows essentially the irs
 
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.109 align:start position:0%
and that it follows essentially the irs
guidelines

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
the income would not be taxable but the
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
deductions for payroll would still be
 
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.710 align:start position:0%
deductions for payroll would still be
allowed

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
those deductions for payroll would still
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
be included in the bet
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
calculation for the new hampshire return
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
different perhaps that helpful i i i
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
think you're confirming that there is a
 
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.109 align:start position:0%
think you're confirming that there is a
b

00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
b
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
e t uh impact on uh
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
from from payroll um but
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
uh i guess i'm just asking you to
 
00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:12.230 align:start position:0%
uh i guess i'm just asking you to
confirm

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
that there that that to the extent that
 
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.510 align:start position:0%
that there that that to the extent that
uh

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
ppp loans are forgiven as a result of uh
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
having been used for qualified expenses
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
that particular revenue is not
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
i mean even if sp3 is not passed
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
i mean if that's if if if new hampshire
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
law stays the way it
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
is and forgiving ppp
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
is therefore included in taxable income
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
it will be
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
entirely offset by the expenses
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
for which it was used the the expenses
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
for which it was used will be included
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
as deductions on the return
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
so there's no net tax effect uh
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
if i may uh chairman major i had another
 
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.870 align:start position:0%
if i may uh chairman major i had another
question

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh so you know in our search
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
for uh for evidence and data we of
 
00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.710 align:start position:0%
for uh for evidence and data we of
course

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
have to rely heavily on anecdote
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
the problem with anecdote is it's spotty
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh you don't know how well
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
reinforced it is but i'm thinking of
 
00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.750 align:start position:0%
reinforced it is but i'm thinking of
several

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
business donors who i know well here in
 
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.349 align:start position:0%
business donors who i know well here in
town

00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh with whom i've had conversation on
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
this topic uh
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i just wonder if i can just describe
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
those two situations very
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
briefly whether you find them to be
 
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.990 align:start position:0%
briefly whether you find them to be
representative

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
or aberrations in one case
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the owner of a moving
 
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.030 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the owner of a moving
company

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
and the other case i'm talking about the
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
owner of a glass company
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh both of them of course were filled
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
with fear
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
when the government imposed
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
limitations came about and uh things
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
temporarily took a nosedive for their
 
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.430 align:start position:0%
temporarily took a nosedive for their
businesses

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
in in march and april uh but by may
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
particularly june july things started to
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
look differently
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
and uh they both would have predicted
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
severe impacts but as it turns out they
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
both did extraordinarily well
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
in 2020 in the case of the glass company
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
they weren't in
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
installing showers so much but they were
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
busy all over the place installing
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
plexiglass dividers in schools and
 
00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:50.470 align:start position:0%
plexiglass dividers in schools and
elsewhere

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
and in the case of the moving company
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
virtually nobody moved for a couple of
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
months and then they saw a surge like
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
they'd never seen before
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
and broke all their records in the
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
second half of the year
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
so i just i think if we were
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
sitting here uh 12 to 14 months ago
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
using our crystal ball we would have
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
drawn very different conclusions about
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
who would be winners and who would be
 
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.950 align:start position:0%
who would be winners and who would be
losers

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
losers
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
there would have been a temptation to
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
assume there were no winners
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
and as things turned out i think maybe
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of surprises have occurred
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
in your practice and just
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
gazing across your clientele um do you
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
see many similar situations or do you
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
um i i have seen some of
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
those situations um
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
and then i i've also seen um some
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
many uh clients who who
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
did um struggle and were negatively
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
impacted for the entire year
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
um you know for and it really just
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
depends on the business
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
who their customers were and how their
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
customers were
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
impacted and sort of how that trickled
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
down to them but yeah i've
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
i i have seen stories like you've
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
described and i've seen
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
um many stories of
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh sort of the opposite impact as well
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's you know pretty diverse in terms of
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
i would agree with carl it's pretty
 
00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:33.990 align:start position:0%
i would agree with carl it's pretty
diverse

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
diverse
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
so basically the conclusion is there's
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative murphy thank you mr
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thanks to our guests for
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
joining us and i
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually was asking the question that
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury just brought
 
00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:03.750 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury just brought
up

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
in my mind given that the cares act and
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
the ppp
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
funds were meant to help employees
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
stay afloat and employees get paid
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
pay for health benefits pay for
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits and wages
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
and given that you both have said that
 
00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:22.549 align:start position:0%
and given that you both have said that
your

00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
clientele is not the water's edge of the
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
large corporations
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
it probably is even more appropriate for
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
the question that representative
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
spillsbury asked because it gives us a
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
flavor of the state
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
and so i was thinking about the various
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
businesses you have the business that
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
took ppe dollars and regardless of how
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
they invested it or
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
used it they folded and declared
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy they had no
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
business profits tax to speak of
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
you then have a company that changed
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
their way
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
received the ppe monies
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh changed their model perhaps and
 
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:00.950 align:start position:0%
uh changed their model perhaps and
perhaps

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
broke even or had minimal profit and
 
00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.069 align:start position:0%
broke even or had minimal profit and
therefore

00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
not necessarily impacted with the
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and then you have
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
the other group that um representative
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
spillsbury talked about and
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to just to get a handle in
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
you on your in your experiences and in
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
your practices
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
there's another group that you know made
 
00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.270 align:start position:0%
there's another group that you know made
really

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
um a significant profit out of the covet
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know whether they were
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
they changed their business model they
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
were putting up plexiglas or whatever
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
but actually do have had a significant
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
profit and did take ppp
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
dollars do you have a sense and i'm just
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get a sense of
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
um percentages in your practices how
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
would those three groups break down
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
is the group that made a significant
 
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:46.710 align:start position:0%
is the group that made a significant
profit

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
profit
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
and impacted with the bpp
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
um attacks uh is that a large number or
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
just a sense i know you don't have an
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
exact number but where do you think
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah i guess that would be really
 
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:05.750 align:start position:0%
um yeah i guess that would be really
hard

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
hard
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
so i yeah i don't know
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i haven't done any sort of review
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
of that nature
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
are you impressed with a significant
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
number of uh businesses that have
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
changed their model and have had a
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
significant uh
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
increase in the profit margin of the
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
i can't say that i can again i haven't
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
looked at that particular
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
ratio to determine if profit margins are
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
up for
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
and and if and if so what what
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of my clients that represents
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative romney thank you mr chair
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
um one thing that came up in our
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
hearings was
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
a discussion of the main street program
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
which took some of the 1.8 billion that
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
the state got and
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
used it for a similar state driven
 
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.870 align:start position:0%
used it for a similar state driven
program

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just curious and my our
 
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh there's uh this per
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
this is totally different and that that
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
there'd be no forgiveness of
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
of uh of the revenue uh or the the
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
of the uh of the loan i don't even know
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
i think it was created as a loan program
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
but have any of your clients mention the
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
main street program to you
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
or whether they want to see
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
some kind of a similar thing done with
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
well i mean in terms of of businesses
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
that receive them
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure any business owner would be
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
happy not to have to pay tax on them
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
um and you know in getting back slight
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
to the kind of the original question
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
when this all started is in terms of the
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
extensions and things
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
my firm at least has for for any client
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
unless there's a clear
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
indication that they're going to have to
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
pay the main street relief funds
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
those funds were included in 2020
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
even though it was presumed
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
even though there may be a small chance
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
they get to have to pay it back and so
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
that income is included in the 2020
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
estimates for the extensions
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
but i'm i can only imagine that
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
businesses would
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
be happy to see that the main street
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
funds are included with the non-taxation
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
of ppp funds if that happens
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:59:49.599 --> 00:59:54.710 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
members

00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%

i gotta and i thank every member
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
got a uh email from a
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
cpa organization
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
and it looks like they're taking a stand
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
of many cpa organizations that are
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
taking a stand
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
one way or the other relative to senate
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm not aware i'm
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware i i don't know yeah no no
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
no no do you have the do you have the
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i've got it uh resident major if
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
you want
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
i had uh that's uh
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
mason rich okay
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
so there's specific firms not
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily the cpa society
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right this was mason rich
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
professional association
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
and it just came in this morning i guess
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
this morning i i read it once and i oh
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
my god
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm gonna have to read that slowly
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
again yeah it's it's tense
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh i was surprised i would have thought
 
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.150 align:start position:0%
uh i was surprised i would have thought
that

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
but you know you don't know of many uh
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
cpas that are
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
out there but i don't i don't know how
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
many more of these letters we're going
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
to get from cpa
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
groups representative major
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
um i think robin abbott is own listening
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
and she may be able to give some light
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
if maceman rich has contacted the
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
society about
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
a physician to my knowledge we haven't
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
heard from anyone
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
in the individual society asking for
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
position we've heard from a lot of
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
individual society excuse me uh
 
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.270 align:start position:0%
individual society excuse me uh
individual

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
firms asking what the outcome
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
is of senate bill 3 and it's been more
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
for clarification how to treat
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
um treat the the grant or loan
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
um in in the tax returns but
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh robin may be able to say if others
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
have contacted her
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
out of position but to my knowledge um
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
we've really been hearing mainly from
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
firms of have you all made a decision
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay i notice in the attendees
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
there's a nhs cpa is that a firm or an
 
01:03:02.319 --> 01:03:03.670 align:start position:0%
there's a nhs cpa is that a firm or an
organization

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
that would be robin abbott the executive
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire society of
 
01:03:08.079 --> 01:03:09.910 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire society of
cpas

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
cpas
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
would she be willing to join us
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh robin i am here can you hear me
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
yes were you able to um listen to the
 
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.430 align:start position:0%
yes were you able to um listen to the
discussion

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
i did listen to the whole discussion and
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for having us on
 
01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.230 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for having us on
today

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
um i missed the last maybe 10 seconds of
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
your comments but i
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
theresa summed it up very nicely as well
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
as carl and
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
kevin so i really want to thank them for
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
being present they are they are
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
stellar in what they do and which is why
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
they represent our tax committee
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
but to your point um i would say there
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
are no specific firms that have reached
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
out to us with the position
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
however many have shown quite
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
a great deal of interest on which they
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
would this was going so that they could
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
advise their clients
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
because their clients have been very
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
stressed about this situation in
 
01:04:05.359 --> 01:04:06.390 align:start position:0%
stressed about this situation in
particular

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
the one organization i would say that
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
does take a stand that you may know of
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
is a national organization called the
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
american institute
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
of certified public accountants that's
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
the aicpa
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
so many of you have probably heard of
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
them before
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
they tend to take a more national
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
legislative stance
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes will trickle down their
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
guidance to us
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not we use that is really up
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
to the society
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
and and our board and our members and
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
and carl said it perfectly
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
um as did kevin as we are neutral on
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
bills but what we try to do is educate
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
our members
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
and educate the legislators as far as
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know what both sides are or
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
are doing so i hope that answers your
 
01:04:45.039 --> 01:04:46.710 align:start position:0%
are doing so i hope that answers your
question

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh yes it does thank you does the
 
01:04:49.599 --> 01:04:50.630 align:start position:0%
uh yes it does thank you does the
committee

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
have any further questions to ask of
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
this distinguished
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
group of people representative major
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative tudor here
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
did i hear um you talk about a stroll
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
straw poll in the beginning of this that
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
i missed that or
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
were you going to tell us about a straw
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
be i'd be happy to tell you it was
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
really just kind of a soft pull to some
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
of my more active members as far as what
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
their sentiment was on
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
sb3 and many who have had interest in
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
this from the beginning
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
um and i would say you know carl summed
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
it up perfectly
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
most cpas are really
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
participating in extensions with their
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
clients or
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
if they aren't they are paying a portion
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
of of what they expect as the ppp
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
with with a bit of um you know
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
uncomfortableness i i
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
would say what i hear mostly is that
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
most of our members
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
and again we do not take a stand but
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
most of our members are in support of
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
sb3 we're one of the only states that is
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
sort of taxing this money so
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
kind of has an icky feel to it when when
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
and i understand our tax structure is
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
very different from other states
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
around the country including in new
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
england but what we've sort of heard is
 
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.029 align:start position:0%
england but what we've sort of heard is
that

01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
people are feeling sort of not so great
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
about being taxed
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
on sort of this found money um but again
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
understanding our tax structure is
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
different um
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're doing what we have to do
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
but i will say this
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
and and to credit carl and kevin for
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
when there was that irx extension on the
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
17th and they had the deadline on the
 
01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:24.150 align:start position:0%
17th and they had the deadline on the
15th

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
15th
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
this has probably been one of the worst
 
01:06:26.559 --> 01:06:27.190 align:start position:0%
this has probably been one of the worst
years

01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
by far for members that they have ever
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
experienced i mean i'm getting calls on
 
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:32.549 align:start position:0%
experienced i mean i'm getting calls on
a

01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
routine basis of yep that's it i'm done
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
i'm hanging up my for sale sign
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm good i'm not doing this anymore it's
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
been really challenging
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
so if there's any way that you can make
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
the practitioners and their
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
clients lives a little bit clearer a
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
little easier
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
that would go a long way right and
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
clear and easier doesn't mean you're
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
taking a stand
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
all right any uh further questions
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
saying thank you very much for pairing
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
with us today you're welcome thank you
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
why don't we just take a quick couple
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
minute break
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.839 --> 01:09:32.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:46.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.839 --> 01:10:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
do you need help figuring out the
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%

and but having chris do
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
we have on our revenues
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
we have flow revenues that
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%

and chris is going to talk about these
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
you get committee members especially
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
those that have
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
come on the last few years uh
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
a history of how this happened and what
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
it does
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%

01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
um so the reason that i'm here today to
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
talk about this if if some of you were
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
on the call i think two
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
meetings ago and i brought up the liquor
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
commission there was a
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
potential for a transfer of liquor funds
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
over to
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%

01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire granite advantage
 
01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.550 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire granite advantage
program

01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
um and and we didn't know the amount we
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
still don't know the amount
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then the members of the committee
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
were asking you know what other programs
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
do we see money come in on a cash basis
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
that then is moved to
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
a restricted or a certain purpose
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
instead of going into the unrestricted
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
general fund and i named four that you
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
know in addition to that i named three
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
others that i was aware of
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up repsome spillsbury
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
reached out to me to get a little bit
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
more information
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
um you know kind of why this occurred
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
and some of the history and and i had
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
done some work for him which he then
 
01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.310 align:start position:0%
done some work for him which he then
asked

01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
asked
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
reps a major just suggesting that maybe
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
i should talk to the committee
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
in total and kind of go over some of
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
these funds and how they occurred and
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
and where we are today with them so that
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm going to do at a kind of
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
a high level i'm going to share my
 
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.229 align:start position:0%
a high level i'm going to share my
screen

01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
screen
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
and it's just going to be it's a
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
narrative of the different programs
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
basically law
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
or chapter law but i'll talk through
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
oh well i i can't share my screen
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's disabled right now but that's i'm
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
jenny jenae i just changed those
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
settings chris sorry about that
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
so you should see l-chip and some yellow
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
highlights so
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
so the l-chip program is the land and
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
community heritage investment program
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
program that matches local or non-profit
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
funds to conserve property buildings
 
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it's a competitive
 
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.149 align:start position:0%
throughout the state it's a competitive
program

01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's something that you know started
 
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
back in the early 2000s and
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
for from 2002 to 2008
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature would put appropriations
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
to fund l-chip and what would typically
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
occur is there'd be an appropriation for
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
a certain
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
amount through the budget process it
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
would be reduced or removed in
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
total so the program didn't have the
 
01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:07.830 align:start position:0%
total so the program didn't have the
seed

01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
seed
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
money to do what it was charged to do
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes there was other efforts to add
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
money in separate bills and those
 
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.030 align:start position:0%
money in separate bills and those
wouldn't

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
survive so there was lots of discussion
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
in the legislative body and
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
and interested groups to try to come up
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
with a dedicated funding mechanism for
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
the l-chip program
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
and what was decided is that a surcharge
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
on certain
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
um documents that the register of deed
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
register of deeds processes and
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
in this sheet before you can see
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
um roman 2 the highlighted part an
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
additional charge of 25
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
shall be assessed so that was the amount
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
that was agreed up to
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
in 2008 session
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
to fund the l-chip program and then what
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
occurred with that is they basically
 
01:15:59.120 --> 01:15:59.750 align:start position:0%
occurred with that is they basically
said

01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
register of deed you shall collect this
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
and remit it back to the state of new
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire basically
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
using the same mechanism that the rep
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
money comes to the state of new
 
01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
money comes to the state of new
hampshire

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
and it would go to the dra who would
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
then peel off or
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
or account for the rep the surcharge
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
related to the lchip program
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
and then that would be used to pay the
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
lchip program
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
through treasury if you were to look at
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
the operating budget you will find
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
in the treasury's operating budget
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
there's a an accounting unit
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
that is for l-chip so the treasury
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
actually cuts a check to l-chip at the
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
start of each um fiscal year
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
there's an estimated budget on what they
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
think they might gain in revenue
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
and if they don't gain that then they
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
don't get all the the appropriation
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
if they get more than what they've
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
estimated they're able to come through
 
01:16:50.159 --> 01:16:50.709 align:start position:0%
estimated they're able to come through
fiscal

01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
through treasury to accept the
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
additional revenue which they've done
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
so so it is money that comes in and
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis there's an adjustment
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
made to
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
remove it from the cash and put it where
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
it belongs with treasury to go to l-chip
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
right now they're estimating about five
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year that that is
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
removed as a result of the surcharge so
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
it's not the ret
 
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
tax that that is doing this it's it's a
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
separate surcharge
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
but it just comes in in the door kind of
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
on the back of the ret tax as it's
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
because back when they put this together
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion about
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
creating more work at the local level
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of collecting and remitting
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
revenue back to the state so that's the
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
l chip i mean if anybody has any
 
01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.950 align:start position:0%
l chip i mean if anybody has any
questions

01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
any questions i see representative
 
01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.870 align:start position:0%
any questions i see representative
romney

01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
romney
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh thanks chris um so when we do our
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're not including that 25 dollars no
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
no um usually that's kind of it's backed
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
out so that when you get to the end of
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
the year
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
you know there's throughout the every
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
month that's backed out of the
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
the uh cash number right so at the end
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
of the year there's an adjustment made
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
you've heard about all these adjustments
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
that occur at the end of the year
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
so when you get your total at the end
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know that the
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
five million you know it's been three to
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
five million a year
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
um is is not included in your base
 
01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.830 align:start position:0%
um is is not included in your base
number

01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay so and i guess one other oh sorry
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
okay i'm just wondering does that get
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
budgeted somewhere that five million or
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
is that just
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
money that comes into that fund so
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's budgeted in the treasury's uh
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
operating budget i get it okay so it's
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
been in there for a number of years
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
um and it continues to be there
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
for i think for a number of reasons i
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
think one of them is so that um
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
people who are interested in what's
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
going on with the lg program can
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
actually see there's an appropriation
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
that goes to that
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
to that program um one thing that did
 
01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:51.669 align:start position:0%
to that program um one thing that did
occur

01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
occur
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
when when they this surcharge was put in
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
place the first few
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
um budget cycles the lchip program still
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
didn't get 100
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the revenue generated the legislature
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
would put language in
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 or or a version of the
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
trailer bill to redirect um
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
some of that revenue back to the general
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
fund these were years when
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
we were going through the great
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
recession or coming out of the great
 
01:19:17.679 --> 01:19:19.350 align:start position:0%
recession or coming out of the great
recession

01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
recession
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
so you may have heard of you know if
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
you've been around at all you've heard
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
the term
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh rating dedicated funds you know rate
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
on the fund
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
and and so that was what's occurring and
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
there was efforts by
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
the supporters of the l-chip program and
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
other dedicated funds to
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
ask the legislature to stop doing that
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
so that since about 2017 i think
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's been no um adjustment that
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
everything has gone to the lchip program
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
and when we get the periodic reports
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
from the department of
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
data services it'll tell us like
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
a recent one says um l chip
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
approximately five hundred thousand
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
dollars which would be
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
which will come out of re tt on the 16th
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
of the month
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
yep yeah so
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
so there's an accounting for it but
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
depending on when you're looking at a
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
report it still may be in the cache
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
so that so it gets a little confusing
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
but it is adjusted out
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
and again when you're doing your
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
estimates in the committee
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
so the next is the the school building
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
aid debt service
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
that comes out of the meals and rooms
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
tax so again similar to
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
tourette there's a note typically on
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
some of the um reports that you get that
 
01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.669 align:start position:0%
some of the um reports that you get that
says

01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
by the certain day of the month the the
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
amount going to the building a debt
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
service will be
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
um will be removed from from the the
 
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.350 align:start position:0%
um will be removed from from the the
numbers

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
so what occurred here is back in 2008
 
01:20:50.159 --> 01:20:50.950 align:start position:0%
so what occurred here is back in 2008
2000

01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
2000
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
well 2009 10 and 11 so so those
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal years but starting in 2008
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
session year
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
there was concerns on with the recession
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
just getting
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
started a concern on meeting the promise
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
to the communities that had borrowed
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
money to build school buildings and the
 
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:10.310 align:start position:0%
money to build school buildings and the
state

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
school building aid program where they
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
match a percentage i think it's up to
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
like 20
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
of of the cost of of the debt service
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
for these
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
buildings at that time um you know
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
building aid it was a significant amount
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
of the budget it was about 40 million
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
and decisions had to be made on how do
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
we fund some of these things we don't
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
have the revenue to support it
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
so back in 2009 during um this was
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
what i'm showing you is the language
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's contained in chapter 144 laws of
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
2009 that was house bill 2 at the time
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that a number of
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
things occurred with the meals and rooms
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
tax at that time
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
it went from 8 to 9 so that's the first
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
um you're going to see there was a
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
section put in that said
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to take the amount
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
necessary so they get the yellow bold
 
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:04.550 align:start position:0%
necessary so they get the yellow bold
here

01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
to pay the interest on the bonds and
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
notes that were authorized
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
and the 198 colon 15a relates to the
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
school building aid
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
debt as well as the amount of 3.15
 
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.189 align:start position:0%
debt as well as the amount of 3.15
percent

01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
that would go to the former dread travel
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
and tourism
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
that number came up earlier this with
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
about a month ago six weeks ago there
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
was some question about this number
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
being suspended in the budget
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
and that is correct so instead of
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
the budget reflecting 3.15 percent of
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms collected it's it's
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
something slightly less than that
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
there's still over 17 million dollars
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
over the biennium going to travel and
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
tourism but
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
the governor and the house proposal is
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
slightly different than what 3.15 would
 
01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.310 align:start position:0%
slightly different than what 3.15 would
equal

01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
equal
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
and as i said the the school building
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
aid during that period
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
in 2009 it was going to be a 40 million
 
01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.709 align:start position:0%
in 2009 it was going to be a 40 million
appropriation

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
and then in 10 and 11 it was just under
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
45 million and then 46.2 million
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
so you're paying on this debt service
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
out to 2030
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
so until that point unless something
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
changes you'll see
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
an amount um taken off every month
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
to pay this uh bond debt service related
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
to the bonds for school building aid
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
the amount is the amount is going down
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
now so the the high point or the most
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
that was ever paid in a particular year
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
was about 14 million
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's down to about 8 million now a year
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it'll continue to trickle down as we
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
again it was it was a decision made at a
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
time when revenues were
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
um lower than anticipated
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
um there was no projection to go forward
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
but the state wanted to to continue to
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
meet that
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
obligation or promise it had made to the
 
01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.870 align:start position:0%
obligation or promise it had made to the
schools

01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
and the communities related to the
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
so that's all i really had to say on
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
that and i can move to the next thing
 
01:24:01.679 --> 01:24:01.990 align:start position:0%
that and i can move to the next thing
unless

01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
unless
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
there's a question it doesn't seem to be
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
any questions go ahead
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
all right i just raised my hand norm
 
01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.870 align:start position:0%
all right i just raised my hand norm
[Music]

01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
i just happened to notice on the first
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
page of that last
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
two slides that campsites were to be
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
taxed and that that didn't last very
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
long now did it
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
no no that's why i didn't bring it up
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
i couldn't resist i know that was ripped
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
very quickly and i guess i should say
 
01:24:30.159 --> 01:24:30.709 align:start position:0%
very quickly and i guess i should say
the

01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
part of the reason i show you that that
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
there was an increase in the meals in
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
rooms tax rate
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
that was part of the debate for
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
justifying that it was okay
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
to at least for the the uh biennium they
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
were budgeting for the 10 and 11
 
01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.070 align:start position:0%
were budgeting for the 10 and 11
biennium

01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
that increase would have allowed for
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
enough money to cover the debt service
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
associated with the school bonding aid
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
skill school building a bonding debt
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
service so
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
that was the reason i showed it there it
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't to create any other
 
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.270 align:start position:0%
wasn't to create any other
discussion

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
the next and the more recent um
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
one that is that you guys are hearing
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
about is the liquor fund transfer
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
related to the new hampshire grant
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
granite advantage
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
so as many um as many people know back
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
in 2014
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
there was changes to medicaid and health
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
insurance through
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
through uh um
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
that basically president obama's changed
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
to health care
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
and one of the changes was to allow for
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of discussion a lot
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
of concern in the state
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
as in many states about this expansion
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
and the costs associated with it
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
when it was first proposed the federal
 
01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.669 align:start position:0%
when it was first proposed the federal
government

01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
was paying 100 of that expanded
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
expansion cost or the medicaid
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
cost associated with that and then over
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
the years
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
it was going to come down from 100
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
percent to where we are today
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
at 90 percent um so there was concerns
 
01:26:12.639 --> 01:26:13.430 align:start position:0%
at 90 percent um so there was concerns
that

01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it was kind of likened to the idea
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
special ed funding that the feds had
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
always promised it would be provided to
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
states and and
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
um there was feelings that they've never
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
fully lived up to that promise
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
that they would do the same thing with
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
the federal dollars associated with the
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion so the legislature
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
passed bills to get it started and then
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
again in 2018
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
because of some changes with the funding
 
01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.590 align:start position:0%
because of some changes with the funding
mix

01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
mix
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
re-authorize it as the new hampshire
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
granite advantage healthcare
 
01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
program and then created a trust fund
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
and one of the things in the trust fund
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
that was negotiated at the time and has
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
been a focus
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
is that no state general fund shall be
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
deposited into the fund
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
so the medicaid expansion program should
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
continue forward without any general
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
funds that was very important and
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
something that's remained in statute
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
since then
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
but as we've gotten increased in the
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of people participating in the
 
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:16.870 align:start position:0%
numbers of people participating in the
program

01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
along with the funding
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
mix being more the state providing a
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
greater share
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
there was some concerns that
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money coming in
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
through the health insurance premium
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
or any other way that is covering the
 
01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:33.910 align:start position:0%
or any other way that is covering the
full

01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
cost between the 90 percent the federal
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
government pays for in the 10 percent
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
so in the in the law there's a section
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
romans six and you're going to see the
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
highlighted piece if you were to remove
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
the highlighted piece that was that's
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
what was there
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
up until 2019. so basically read the
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
commission accords with the most current
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
available information
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
shall be responsible for determining
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly commencing no later than
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
december 31 2018
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
whether there is sufficient funding in
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
the fund to cover projected program
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
costs for the non-federal share
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
for the next six month period if at any
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
time the commissioner
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
determines that a pr projected shortfall
 
01:28:15.199 --> 01:28:16.070 align:start position:0%
determines that a pr projected shortfall
exists

01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
he or she will terminate the program in
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
accordance with the federally approved
 
01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.149 align:start position:0%
accordance with the federally approved
terms

01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
terms
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
and conditions issued by cmc
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
so prior to the liquor commission aspect
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
being added that was the concern
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
and if that language wasn't in there
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
earlier this year
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
health and human services would have had
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
to abide if
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
there had been no change would have had
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
to abide by this language and start to
 
01:28:39.199 --> 01:28:40.390 align:start position:0%
to abide by this language and start to
terminate

01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
terminate
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
or close down the medicaid expanded
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
program because of
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
a lack of funding so one way to
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
address this was to use the liquor
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
commission fund
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
and the suggestion is it's not
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
at this point it's not general funds so
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
you've you've still abided by the
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh no use of general funds um
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
but because of the uncertainty and
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
knowing what kind of shortfall you're
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
going to have in the out years
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
they've allowed for an open
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation and for the amount
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to be transferred from the
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
liquor commission fund
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
and then there's a statement that um you
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
know if there's then if there's no
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
if there's insufficient funds from the
 
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
liquor fund
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
then they shall at that point start the
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
process to close or
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
re eliminate the program
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
so that's that's how that occurred and
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's the reason it's occurred is that
 
01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:35.510 align:start position:0%
that's the reason it's occurred is that
the

01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature a couple years ago was
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
looking for a
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
a mechanism that could fund the program
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
if there was a shortfall
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
and then the last one and probably the
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
most recent one
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
that you've seen is the affordable
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
housing affordable housing is not a new
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
issue in the state of new hampshire it's
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
been discussed uh
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know for over 10 years now in
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
various venues
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
if you were to do a simple search in in
 
01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:04.950 align:start position:0%
if you were to do a simple search in in
the

01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
bill search function in on the website
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
um you're going to see bills going back
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
you know like i said
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
10 years or more for study committees
 
01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:15.910 align:start position:0%
10 years or more for study committees
commissions

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
bills that would have provided capital
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
appropriations to
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
do affordable housing incentives for
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
your municipalities and
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
and local governments to set up
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing funds
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
and in the last few years you've heard a
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
workforce and the inability for the
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
workforce to find housing
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
which is creating some challenges for
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
businesses that want to grow
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
or expand or move into the area so this
 
01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:45.030 align:start position:0%
or expand or move into the area so this
last

01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
budget session it was felt that you know
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
this is probably the right time to
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
dedicate or restrict five million
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
dollars a year that comes in through the
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
real estate um
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
um transfer tax to to
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
go into the affordable housing fund
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
and and then the housing finance
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
authority is responsible for that fund
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
and they would um be the group um making
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
it available to the communities and the
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
places and businesses that that would be
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for it
 
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
so you saw that hit the first time back
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
in september
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
of this uh f20 september 20
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
and uh it caused a lot of questions at
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
that time because as you saw
 
01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
a reduction of a comment about a
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
reduction of 5 million dollars
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
for the the housing finance authority
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
for the affordable housing
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
in the revenue focus that came out after
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
that month
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
so i think you know the reason i'm
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
talking about this is just to provide
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of a
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
history that on why some of these
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
actions occurred it's
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
many times it's not as a result of oh
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
today i think it's a good idea that i
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
take money and restrict it from this
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
fund for a purpose that is fairly newly
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
discussed you most of these have
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
had discussions for a number of
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
and there's been a number of different
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
efforts to find a way to
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
have a steady revenue stream for them
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
so so those are the four that you know
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
stuck out and that we you know i
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
kind of talked about at a high level the
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
other day and
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
this is just a little bit lower but
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
still at a high level
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have well thank you
 
01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have well thank you
chris

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
chris
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
and with this mechanism if you continue
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh dedicating
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
these revenue streams to specific
 
01:32:43.750 --> 01:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
items then there'd be a lot less general
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
funds that can be utilized to support
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of the
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
budget kind of short search
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
short circuits so they regular budget
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
process i i think reps have all me
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
jumped off the call for she had a
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
conflict with another meeting but if i
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
think she was on the call
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
she would probably um i'm going to
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
suggest that she would make a comment
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
about the whole dedicated
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
fund process where that you know that's
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
in some ways this is a is like that you
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
know it's it's restricting a certain
 
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.430 align:start position:0%
know it's it's restricting a certain
revenue

01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
or a piece of a certain revenue for a
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
purpose the dedicated funds are truly
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
that where the revenue doesn't come into
 
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.390 align:start position:0%
that where the revenue doesn't come into
the

01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
um the collections of the general fund
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
or the highway fund or
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
that we see on in the revenue focus but
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
they're they go directly to those funds
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
the four that i just shared with you are
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
slightly different in that they do kind
 
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
of pass through
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
the the collection of the revenue that
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
that you see in the revenue focus but
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
and then they're deposited to a
 
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
a particular place i think
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
representatives hand up reps of major
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
props yeah i just want to ask
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
chris if you can send us this uh slide
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
pack yep
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
yep i'll i'll do that
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much chris
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
we all appreciate it
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and uh
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
the i've asked the dr80 president
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
the revenues
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
lost due to senate bill 3 and they
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
emailed you their latest estimate but
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:50.790 align:start position:0%
 
melissa

01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh representative gomarlo cut
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
out so i've just promoted
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
carolyn melissa and devin oh thank you
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
good morning representatives good
 
01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.750 align:start position:0%
good morning representatives good
morning

01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
so carolyn could you give us an update
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
of where you are
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 3
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
and its effect on revenues yeah so
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
um what you saw this morning was our
 
01:35:19.199 --> 01:35:20.229 align:start position:0%
um what you saw this morning was our
analysis

01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the um or
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact assuming that all
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
ppp loans were issued
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
by the end of the month um that is a
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of just under 100 million
 
01:35:35.679 --> 01:35:36.550 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of just under 100 million
dollars

01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
and i saw a news article come across my
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
screen this morning that i didn't have
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to open
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
up that said that as of today they have
 
01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.669 align:start position:0%
up that said that as of today they have
exhausted

01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
exhausted
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
the full appropriation for ppp so i
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
think that is a good
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
final um impact for you folks to use
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
i saw the same thing this morning
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
um right now uh you know where
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here i think the
 
01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.109 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here i think the
department

01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
is trying to look at some possible
 
01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.790 align:start position:0%
is trying to look at some possible
methodologies

01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
methodologies
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
for helping you understand the
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year impact of
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
our analysis you know we we've presented
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
it as a total but not
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
broken it up by fiscal year
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
but certainly we would expect it to
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
happen across
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
many fiscal years um representative
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
ames had forwarded the california
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
analysis and we're actually trying to do
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
some digging to see if we can speak with
 
01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:38.070 align:start position:0%
some digging to see if we can speak with
someone

01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
from california to see how they broke
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
their analysis up by fiscal year
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
for pp
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
for their ppp bill
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and the california on their
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
they said it's gonna cost them six point
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars uh by forgiving the
 
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.870 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars uh by forgiving the
loan

01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
loan
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
but i have no idea what their total
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
corporate taxes agreed and i also noted
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
when i
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
pulled up that bill it was a bit more
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than ours
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
it also included the impact
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
for certain federal treatment of
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
eidl loans which is not contained
 
01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:34.790 align:start position:0%
eidl loans which is not contained
without

01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
within our sp3 so we'll have to
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
carefully sort of
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh evaluate whether the california
 
01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.709 align:start position:0%
uh evaluate whether the california
methodology

01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
works for our bill um but we are looking
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
into that
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
am i may represent major reps in ames
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah uh that's great i'm glad you're
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
looking at that um
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
the other another difference for
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
california is that they've excluded
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
publicly traded companies and i don't
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
know what that
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
the dimensions of that would be but i
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
don't think we could do that in new
 
01:38:12.159 --> 01:38:12.709 align:start position:0%
don't think we could do that in new
hampshire

01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
even if we wanted to and then there's a
 
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:16.629 align:start position:0%
even if we wanted to and then there's a
25

01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
000 rule that they've got in there
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
so firms that have
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
who's i can't remember how it works but
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's a 25
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
000 um bar
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you can explain it i can't quite
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
put it together i think it's the 25
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
decline 2020 over 19.
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
and i think the only other thing that i
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
would add is i think
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
the testimony that you heard
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
from the cpas today was very helpful
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
um i think that we often don't have the
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know the very granular taxpayer
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
perspective on these things because
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're not return preparers
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
um so i think it's definitely helpful to
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
understand what they're seeing
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the field to know that really there's
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
a spectrum
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
of treatments that taxpayers have
 
01:39:17.679 --> 01:39:18.790 align:start position:0%
of treatments that taxpayers have
adopted

01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
and certainly we are seeing
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
currently and melissa can jump in with
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
the stats if she wants to
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
but we are seeing very high levels of
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
um extensions this year and
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
i think that means that we're going to
 
01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:36.629 align:start position:0%
i think that means that we're going to
have

01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
really limited information about what
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have done
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
on their 2020 returns until such time as
 
01:39:44.719 --> 01:39:45.510 align:start position:0%
on their 2020 returns until such time as
those

01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
extended returns are in fact filed
 
01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
um what we have now for data is just
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
so limited that it's not particularly
 
01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.310 align:start position:0%
so limited that it's not particularly
useful

01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
useful
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
if i may comment uh that
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah um
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so the extensions are um
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but the amount
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
of money
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
um paid with uh for extensions
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
is is unprecedented in size
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
and um and yet it's a black hole for you
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
all you have is a number is that correct
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right melissa do you have
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
the exact stats
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
sure melissa allen senior financial
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
analyst for the department
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah everything you're saying
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative ames is completely
 
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:38.629 align:start position:0%
representative ames is completely
accurate

01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
so extensions this month were 131.5
 
01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:42.790 align:start position:0%
so extensions this month were 131.5
million

01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
that is we have a 10-year trend on the
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
estimate analysis and voucher analysis
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
that we send out to you and that is by
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
far the highest we have ever seen
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's 195 percent above fiscal year 20
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
however i caution you to compare it to
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 because we do know that
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
the federal due date and
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
state new hampshire due date in fiscal
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
year 20 was extended to june
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
um for new hampshire and july for
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
federal but if you do
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
um compare that to fiscal year 19
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's about 50 or 51 million above
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
or 63 above 2019
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
so a very significant um
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
increase in dollars and counts for sure
 
01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:27.510 align:start position:0%
increase in dollars and counts for sure
for

01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
extensions representative spellsbury
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
i i thought that the the question that
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
asked yesterday during our discussion
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
about timing
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
um posed potential conundrums that we
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought about and i certainly
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't in a position to uh uh to clarify
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
so both of the accountants who
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
spoke to us this morning
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
alluded to that same concern
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
when they were talking about the
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
relative merits
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
of amending
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
sb3 versus
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
just not passing it and
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
it it seemed to me when they were saying
 
01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.669 align:start position:0%
it it seemed to me when they were saying
that

01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
that the discrepancies in timing
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
actually highlight
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
a fundamental flaw in
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
the uh intent of sb3 and that is
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
if it's already true
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
that qualifying for loan forgiveness
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
requires uh deploying
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
the funds for qualified uh expenses
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
they've already been offset
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing here if we also
 
01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:52.790 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing here if we also
allow

01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
the deductions to be taken is we're
 
01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.270 align:start position:0%
the deductions to be taken is we're
de-linking

01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
de-linking
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh the expenses from the source of funds
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
and this de-linking this this allowing
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
expenses that were already used that
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
were already paid for with one set of
 
01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:09.270 align:start position:0%
were already paid for with one set of
funds

01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
to be deducted against another set of
 
01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.950 align:start position:0%
to be deducted against another set of
revenue

01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
is exacerbating the timing problem
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
was there i yeah i agree and um i
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
was there a question or were you just
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
asking if i agreed with that
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh i suppose i'm asking if you agree
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
but i i i guess the point is that if the
 
01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.390 align:start position:0%
but i i i guess the point is that if the
amendment

01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the amendment to sb3 is
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
in effect to neutralize the impact of
 
01:43:46.239 --> 01:43:48.070 align:start position:0%
in effect to neutralize the impact of
sb3

01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
sb3
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
is it probably not correct that the
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
accountant's observation
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
is it might be better to just not pass
 
01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:55.910 align:start position:0%
is it might be better to just not pass
sb3

01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
sb3
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
because that would be the less
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
complicated route
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
yes i agree that um
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
that it would certainly
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
be a complication to taxpayers relative
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
to the timing of the disallowed expenses
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and i think that exists
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
potentially as well with
 
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
sb3 as proposed in both scenarios i
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
think what you're looking at
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
is the possibility of a large number
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
of amended 2020 returns
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of what form senate bill 3
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately takes but as
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
you can certainly imagine
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
an amended return that results in a
 
01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.149 align:start position:0%
an amended return that results in a
reduced

01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
tax liability feels a bit different to a
 
01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:52.870 align:start position:0%
tax liability feels a bit different to a
taxpayer

01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
than an amended return that results in
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
an increased
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
liability so i think
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
for planning purposes one is probably
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
more palatable to a taxpayer than the
 
01:45:04.719 --> 01:45:09.030 align:start position:0%
more palatable to a taxpayer than the
other

01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you good observation
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
rep senator brandon that leads us to the
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
question of
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
the same conversation here of uh whether
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
we amend our
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh if we amend
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
is it is it the same as
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
just killing the bill in terms of
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
so if you amend
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
the the bill concurrent with uh
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury's draft
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
amendment i think what you would see is
 
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:49.109 align:start position:0%
amendment i think what you would see is
a

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
very drastic reduction in the fiscal
 
01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:53.510 align:start position:0%
very drastic reduction in the fiscal
impact

01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
but there would be
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
still a small fiscal impact i believe
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
that the requirement to qualify for
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
forgiveness was not that 100 percent
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
be spent on qualified expenses i believe
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
80 be spent on qualified expenses
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
and so there would still be potentially
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
a 20
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
or less amount
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
of what we've currently calculated that
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
would be a fiscal impact but it would
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
certainly be
 
01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
significantly decreased i follow up
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
misters so what i to take away from what
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
they were saying uh that the accountants
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
related to bet
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
with the amendment or or killing the
 
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:51.270 align:start position:0%
with the amendment or or killing the
bill

01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
or amending it there may be some
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
interaction with the bet that may be a
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
little different is what i kind of took
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
away from
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the direct bet impact
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
is the same regardless of
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
how sp3 makes it out
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
of committee if it does um the bet
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
direct impact is um
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
is the same i believe what uh carl and
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
kevin were saying
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
was that for many taxpayers
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
they have so much bet credit that
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
um sb3 doesn't really impact
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
their ultimate tax liability
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
um and that is actually baked into
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
our our analysis that you have currently
 
01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:45.830 align:start position:0%
our our analysis that you have currently
we

01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
we account for those taxpayers that
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
will not have a bet or will not have a
 
01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:53.510 align:start position:0%
will not have a bet or will not have a
bpt

01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
bpt
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
liability due to their bet credit um
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
can i interject one other thing
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes so may 11th is coming upon us
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
the six days away uh a general question
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
anybody is anybody heard
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
including dra of of the treasury
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
federal treasury coming up with guidance
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
on the 1.9 trillion dollars
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
that does have a bearing on our
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
discussions i think
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
and i i i haven't heard any anything has
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
anybody heard anything
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
i've been looking i haven't seen
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
anything right we're all waiting for the
 
01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:40.310 align:start position:0%
anything right we're all waiting for the
guidance

01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
and it's six days away we're not going
 
01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:43.830 align:start position:0%
and it's six days away we're not going
to

01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
exact senate bill 3 on the 11th if we
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
more information such as this guidance
 
01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.550 align:start position:0%
more information such as this guidance
right

01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just just reminding everybody that
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's still hanging out there
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions asked
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
of the dra if not
 
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
i want to remind the committee that
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
before we get to
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 565
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
next week we're going to have an exact
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll exact six of the seven
 
01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.550 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll exact six of the seven
bills

01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
the one we won't be exacting the senate
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
bill 3
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
and then on wednesday the 12th
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue with revenues
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
we can have somebody come in and i'm
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
hoping that we have
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
guidance on the latest stimulus
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
the next thing we want to discuss is
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
has been working with the senate
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
house bill 565 which we had passed
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
and it also appears
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
in an anonymous bill over there so
 
01:50:14.639 --> 01:50:15.270 align:start position:0%
in an anonymous bill over there so
represent

01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
romney would you explain that yeah so i
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
touched on it briefly yesterday but i
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
i since then i did have a conversation
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
with senator d'alessandro
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
and with representative hill who chairs
 
01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:29.189 align:start position:0%
and with representative hill who chairs
the

01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
legislative administration committee
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
which is where this
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
is senate bill 100 which is an omnibus
 
01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:37.030 align:start position:0%
is senate bill 100 which is an omnibus
bill

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
and section four relates to a uh
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
committee to study charitable gaming
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
so our uh representative
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i chatted with representative ames
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday morning about this as well
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh but now i got a little more detail so
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 565 passed out of our
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee which was our version of
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
of the uh a study committee uh chair
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
study channel gaming committee
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh passed unanimous out of us that
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
passed on the floor in consent
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
whenever the senate the senate passed it
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh but then put it on the table
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's still unclear why they put it on
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
the table but i could think of some
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
scenarios why they put it on the table
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
now in our bill we just said three
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
members of the house
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
and two members of the uh picked by the
 
01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:27.990 align:start position:0%
and two members of the uh picked by the
speaker

01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
and two members of the senate appointed
 
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
by the senate president
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the hou and the senate version
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
they they say two members of the senate
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
one that comes from finance and one that
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
comes from ways and means
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
and then they say in their version they
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
say three members of the house
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
one from ways and means one from finance
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
the other is either or or
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
other committee appointed by the the uh
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
house speaker so
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
what i suggested to senator d'alessandro
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
this morning is that you know we have no
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
problem with the senate picking who they
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
want to be on their
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
on the committee um but
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
we may want to change what
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
the makeup on our side is and uh
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
i said uh i i think
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's better that that the
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
members come all from ways and means
 
01:52:28.239 --> 01:52:29.109 align:start position:0%
members come all from ways and means
because

01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
on the house side because we're the most
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
familiar with this
 
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
how many i suggested well can we make it
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
at least one from the minority party
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
which would probably happen on its own
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh usually these they usually if it's
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
three members it'll be two from the
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
majority party one from the minority
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
party most committees that i've been on
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
over the years that's the way it works
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
but we we could state it that way so
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
he had no problem senator alessandro
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
said yeah that's fine but why don't you
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
make it two and two
 
01:53:12.070 --> 01:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
so that's another option um
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan uh committee
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh at all we're just trying to study all
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
aspects of charitable gaming
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm fine with it either way
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh if we if we amend
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill uh 100
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
section part four where this resides
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
um to do to say either
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh two uh two members or three members
 
01:53:41.119 --> 01:53:41.430 align:start position:0%
uh two uh two members or three members
the

01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
ways and means two from the majority
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
party one from the minority party
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
or four members of ways of means
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
to two members that come from the uh
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
minority party and two to come from
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
majority party
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
so uh i was just trying to get a feel
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
committee of would anybody object if
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh either way on this
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay so and then i
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
i i uh so there's a chance these are
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills so when i talk to
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh to the uh representative hill
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
chairs legislative administration he
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
says that there's about
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
six or seven commissions or committees
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
that are there
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
he says there's probably going to be
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
only one or two that are going to
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
survive and they're going to amend out
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
some of these others so
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
ours being one that will survive and
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
then what i'm going to do i said well i
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
need to get you an amendment
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
he says no i don't do that i'm going to
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
be putting an amendment through
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
just give us the language that you want
 
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
for this which i'll i'll do
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
so uh but then he then he was a little
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
and there's reason why we should pass
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
this and then also you know uh
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
support and then i asked senator del
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
sancho this morning
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
i said if we amend this and if
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason this omnibus bus
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't make it through the house
 
01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:13.189 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't make it through the house
floor

01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh that you'll be willing to amend the
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 565 in the same manner and he
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
said yeah absolutely so
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
we're good either way but but
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative hill said
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
you know there could be a reason why he
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
thought more conspiracy theory than i
 
01:55:33.599 --> 01:55:34.310 align:start position:0%
thought more conspiracy theory than i
did

01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
there could be another reason why they
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
they tabled it
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
is because they may hang other bills
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
onto this one and make it a christmas
 
01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:44.870 align:start position:0%
onto this one and make it a christmas
tree

01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
tree
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
yes so uh
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
so he says yeah we'll make sure we pass
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
it so that
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know they can't make both of these
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
christmas trees so
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh because what happens if they do that
 
01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
there's an odd
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
there's it could be that we just get so
 
01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
frustrated with the senate
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
that they hung all these other things
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
that we just veto the whole you know we
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
we vote no on the floor to the amended
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
566 565 so
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's some of the high intrigue here
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem with what
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
pat has has said i i don't i
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh i guess i wonder um
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
i do have a a favorite between four
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
members from the house and two members
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
from the house
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
not really i'd be honest with you i i
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
think it'd probably be better
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
to have the four um that's what i'm
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
thinking too
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
about who's gonna show up from the
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
senate a little more participation on
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
our side
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree again it's not a partisan
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
thing to me it's
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh i don't think it is i i think we
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
need to have more representation there
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
um to keep the quorum or whatever to
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
do yeah yeah i'm gonna have to leave
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
right at noon so
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm upset thank you all right i got what
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
