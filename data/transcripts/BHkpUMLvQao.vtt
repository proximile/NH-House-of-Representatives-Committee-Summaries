parents sometimes find out that the
 
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
reality of these programs is that the
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
ultimate choice
 
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
resides with the school or educational
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
program not with the parent
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
we need to look at protecting these
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
families who are rejected

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
our community public school system
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
is governed by federal and state laws

have to abide by the state these laws

in a certain school
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
because of their program
 
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
or perhaps the location of the school
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
can be turned away because their child
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
is transgender or gay
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
the child may have some discipline
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
problems disabilities

emotional or mental issues
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
imagine a child with a simple

with a disability
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
maybe they're deaf
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
or their wheelchair bound or maybe they
 
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
have two moms
 
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
they've spent six years in a community
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
public elementary school
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
and their school and classmates have
 
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
accepted them
 
00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
supported them and nurtured them
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
their school has specialists they have
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
ramps or elevators they have special
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
bathroom facilities to meet their needs
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
as required for all public schools
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
time in their school has come to an end
 
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
or their parent has decided they want to
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
move the child out of the school
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
and the child must move to another
 
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.230 align:start position:0%
and the child must move to another
school

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
during the year there was a presentation
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
the efa program and now they even have
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
more choices
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that nice private school in the
 
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
next town over
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
or a nearby religious school or a
 
00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:32.830 align:start position:0%
or a nearby religious school or a
tuition

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
program school that looks like an
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
attractive place for their child
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
this child wants to stay with his or her
 
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.029 align:start position:0%
this child wants to stay with his or her
friends

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
friends
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
so their parents did decide to enroll
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
their child
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
with their friends
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
but this child is not accepted at the
 
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
but this child is not accepted at the
school

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
they did not meet
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
the admission criteria
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
the school is very sorry but the child
 
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.749 align:start position:0%
the school is very sorry but the child
isn't

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
a good fit
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps another school would be better
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
and they'd be willing to help them find
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
another school
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
the rejecting school is under no law or
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
mandate to accept everybody or anybody
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
who applies
 
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
they are not subject to laws prohibiting
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%

who take public funds to follow the new
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%

the responsibility for ensuring these
protections

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.670 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
what i have here is a bill that will
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
extend the discrimination protections
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
the to the protected classes listed in
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire law
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
many of the protections that you'll see
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
that are under the
 
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.829 align:start position:0%
that are under the
civil

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
civil
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
civil liberties area
 
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.470 align:start position:0%
civil liberties area
in

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
are more and federal statute are more
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
concerned with
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
race religion
 
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.550 align:start position:0%
race religion
age

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
and those
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
are for employment and housing
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
so this extends it to the school system
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
whereas the other ones like i said are
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
for employment and housing
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
and i'll entertain any questions
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
there questions for representative
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
the way i read this it means if there's
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
a small private school for gifted kids
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
that a child
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
that the parents of a child who say have
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
certain mental disabilities or whatever
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
at any rate
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise don't really fit into what
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
that school is aimed for
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
can demand that their child goes there
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
because otherwise they're being
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
discriminated against based on
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
mental disability
 
00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
mental disability
if

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
they apply to that school and that
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
school receives public funding
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
our our taxpayer dollars
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
then they should be accepted to that
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
school with uh
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
special um
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
needs special
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
accommodations i guess is what i would
 
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.389 align:start position:0%
accommodations i guess is what i would
say

00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
do they never
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
send a kid out to someplace else because
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
they feel like they the kid has
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
whatever issues that they can't deal
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
with they do but they pay for it
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
the schools that we're talking about
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't have the student
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
then so how could they
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
apparently yes
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think if there's a robotic school
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
and you know we oftentimes we think of
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
robotics as being
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
the higher end kids that are you know
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
into stem and that sort of thing and
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
somebody with a disability wants to
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
apply to that
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't be discriminated
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
further further questions
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative cordelli
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
could you define what your intention is
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
by use of the words public funds
 
00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.430 align:start position:0%
by use of the words public funds
sure

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
when money is collected by the
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
government it's collected from the
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
people of the state
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
it's collected
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
through taxation
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
and a number of other different ways and
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
it becomes public money and it is our
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
duty as representatives
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
we have a duty to spend that money as
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
efficiently and as effectively and as
 
00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.030 align:start position:0%
efficiently and as effectively and as
transparently

00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
transparently
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
as we can and that's what i consider
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
public funds
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead uh thank you um
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
would that include federal
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%

question
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
very much for uh for taking my question
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
for offering um this introducing this
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
bill this morning representative tanner
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
can charter schools currently um
 
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.069 align:start position:0%
can charter schools currently um
um

00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
let me make sure i use the term right um
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
lawfully discriminate against the
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
protected classes that you've listed
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
here you know i was looking that up
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
representative uno um
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we actually uh put into law that
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
public schools have to follow the
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination or the
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
outlined in in 193
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
colon 38
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
and since charter schools are considered
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
um you would think that it would apply
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
um although they weren't specifically
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
tagged in that in that statute and if
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's the case that that it doesn't
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
apply to them
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
then we should extend it to them
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative i have uh one question
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
we have a number of schools that are
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
small schools in the state that do
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
tuition their students out after fifth
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
fourth grade fifth grade sixth grade etc
 
00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:28.230 align:start position:0%
fourth grade fifth grade sixth grade etc
to

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
other public schools
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
there is one situation that i know of
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
that there is a public high school that
 
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.230 align:start position:0%
that there is a public high school that
will

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
accept all the kids from these k-4
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
programs or k-6
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
however within that same tuition
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
agreement of those sending schools there
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
are some schools that refuse to accept
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
some students
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
i don't give any names out but that is
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
the situation occurs so would the public
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
schools that are
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
not receiving certain types of students
 
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.470 align:start position:0%
not receiving certain types of students
be

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
have a problem with this whereas the
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
sending school also though has a tuition
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
agreement with a public high school that
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
will take the kids so there is an
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for tuitioning out
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
you're following where i'm coming yes i
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
am and i think it's in your neighborhood
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
okay well it could could very well be in
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
my neighborhood i don't want to point
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
fingers but i would say that um to me
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things why this bill
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
is important
 
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
i will say that my local school
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
accepts quite a few
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
students for on tuition from other
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
schools because it's one of the more
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
higher performing schools in the
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
as it does
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
they do refuse students but they refuse
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
them because they don't have room
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
they set a certain
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
size limit on their classes
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
and they will
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
accept tuition students up to a certain
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
number but as far as who they accept
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
if they're a public school
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
and if they're under this law
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
accepting public funding through
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
efas tax credit scholarships
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
the education freedom accounts
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
then they need to
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
not discriminate against students
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
because they have a disability
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
or because they're transgender or
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
because they're gay or uh the economic
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
or social situation of their parents or
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
that they've had
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh problems before with discipline in
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
other schools
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i i have one other follow-up
 
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.590 align:start position:0%
and i i have one other follow-up
question

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
uh when we are sending our students out
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
from a
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
sending school to a career technical
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
education center the cte may reject some
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
students based upon prerequisites
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that is not going to be
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
an issue with this yes you've written
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
this discrimination revolves around
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
protected classes people that have
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
suffered discrimination in the past
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
classes that have suffered
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the past
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
or there's a history of discrimination
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore the government steps in
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
and provides non-discrimination laws so
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
that those people have
 
00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:15.110 align:start position:0%
that those people have
access

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
particularly in the public
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
public sphere and they can function as
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
any other citizen in in the united
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
states rather than being excluded
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
or treated differently so in follow-up
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
to that when we're looking at one of the
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
categories is a mental disability
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
and a student is rejected going to the
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
cte center seeing that that student has
 
00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:38.069 align:start position:0%
cte center seeing that that student has
not

00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
does not have the prerequisites to get
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
in that program that's done all over
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
this state would this
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
be implied or seen as a rejection due to
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
mental disability or would it be seen as
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
a rejection due to
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
not having the prerequisite courses
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's something with discrimination
 
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.150 align:start position:0%
that's something with discrimination
charges

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
charges
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
and hearings that
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
you know are those kind of thready lines
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
that uh people uh need to to examine and
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
find out exactly what what the
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
what the situation is and whether it is
 
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.870 align:start position:0%
what the situation is and whether it is
prerequisites

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
further follow uh questions
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
how would you see the state board of
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
education um enforcing um these
 
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
education um enforcing um these
provisions

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
the same way they enforce
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
the hearings
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
for manifest hardship
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
where a parent wishes to send their
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
school student to another school
 
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.230 align:start position:0%
school student to another school
and

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
the school that's
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
providing that um they can actually ask
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
for a hearing and i think that's
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
that's where
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
it should be in the it's around public
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
education and i know ols
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to put this under the civil
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
rights commission but
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
it really is an educational issue it
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be dealt with in education in
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.470 align:start position:0%
yes
but

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
we did uh put uh educational description
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me discrimination also under uh
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
the human rights uh
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
provisions um in uh
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
just wondering why
 
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.950 align:start position:0%
just wondering why
those

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
protections are not
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient in the human rights
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
is set up to do uh investigations and
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
hold hearings uh why not there their
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
investigations and and their focus
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
is employment public accommodations it's
 
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.510 align:start position:0%
is employment public accommodations it's
not

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
specific to education and and it can
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
deal with education but it's not
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
specific to education and therefore the
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
state school board
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh that that
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
offers hearings and adjudicates a lot of
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
issues in education
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
can and could do this um and i know
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
uh they may not want to
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for thanking my
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
question uh i missed your intro i got
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
here a little late and trying things on
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
shovels here
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
how did this align itself with governor
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
sununu's discrimination
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee he had a year or two ago in
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
terms of anti-discrimination well the
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know we we know that the the finding
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
of that commission
 
00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.510 align:start position:0%
of that commission
um

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
told us about the the discrimination or
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
how students felt uh discriminated
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
against in public schools
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
being transgender or gay in particular
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
but for other reasons as well i mean
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
kids get bullied for a lot of different
 
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.789 align:start position:0%
kids get bullied for a lot of different
reasons

00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
this extends a little bit further and
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
extends to particularly school choice
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
that expands to school choices i said
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
before we already put in law that public
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
schools have to follow
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
the non-discrimination laws of new
 
00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.070 align:start position:0%
the non-discrimination laws of new
hampshire

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
which are much more extensive than the
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
federal laws
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative moffett thank
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
you michelle thank you taking my
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
question i asked this question as a
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
former teacher at trinity high school
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
where i went to after being in a public
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
school where i worked on the ieps with
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
the special education staff now with
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
trinity when i went there a long time
 
00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:39.990 align:start position:0%
trinity when i went there a long time
ago

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
they had no special ed staff they had no
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
special ed students per se like the
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
public schools did it was as i read this
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
proposed measure
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
a school like trinity or private school
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
charter school i'm thinking of the
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
little school representative porter
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
described this used to run
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
as i read this
 
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.149 align:start position:0%
as i read this
if

00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
any of these schools receive public
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
funds directly or indirectly it sounds
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
like they have to
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
accept special needs students and ergo
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
would have to create
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
special ed staffs or hire special ed
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
educators is that said am i reading that
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
correctly yeah you're reading that
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
correctly because if they accept public
 
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.230 align:start position:0%
correctly because if they accept public
funds

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
funds
then

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
that means that they should be open
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
and not discriminate and if
 
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.310 align:start position:0%
and not discriminate and if
they

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
trinity exists because people pay
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
people pay their own money to send their
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
child to trinity
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh they want a religious education a
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
catholic education and
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's why they send them there and
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's fine i mean it's it's fine if i
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
want to use a toll highway and pay the
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
toll for it that's that's great but the
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
interstate highways are open to
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
everybody and that's how that's how
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
america is it's not
 
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.270 align:start position:0%
america is it's not
uh

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
setting up classes of you know people
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
that can't
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
go to certain schools
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
and still exist for the on the public
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
funds public funds are for public good
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
they they're for the public okay if it
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't say those schools can't exist
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that they can't run it says
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
that if they accept public funding then
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
they have to follow the
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
well what yes
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
do you have any concern that like some
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
of the smaller schools that are on very
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
tight tight margins
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
and have special missions or special
 
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.430 align:start position:0%
and have special missions or special
focus

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
focus
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
and again i go back to the school that
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative porter described several
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
times you're concerned that some of
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
these little schools that are on margins
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
if suddenly they have to hire special ed
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
staff they would go out of business
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
any concern well you know we're in a
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
capitalist society and if we're going to
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
put education in the consumer base then
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with the issues that
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
capital capitalism and consumerism
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh provides for us
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative porter
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.070 align:start position:0%
can i can i reply to representative
moffat

moffat
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
no we're not going to go this way
 
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this to us
 
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.350 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this to us
today

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
i i'm i'm making an assumption and i'm
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to either
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
correct me or agree with my perception
 
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.789 align:start position:0%
correct me or agree with my perception
that

00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
if you're applying to a school
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the prerequisites as
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative vlad uh
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
indicated it let's say it's a polish
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
speaking school
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
and you're applying to the polish
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
speaking school
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
and you also happen to
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
if you're applying to the polish
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
speaking school and you speak polish and
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
you're gay
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's different than applying to the
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
polish speaking school
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
being gay and not speaking polish
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
so if you were denied admission to the
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
school because you didn't speak polish
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
that would not be considered
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
discrimination is that correct to me
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
that would be a prerequisite
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
um and i think uh
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
the examples you gave are are right on
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli do you have a
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you uh just wondering
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
about your
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts on public schools that reject
 
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.230 align:start position:0%
thoughts on public schools that reject
students

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
i know of
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
at least one case where
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
received best interest
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
determination by their local school
 
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.590 align:start position:0%
determination by their local school
district

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
applied to two local public school
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
systems and was rejected by them
 
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.590 align:start position:0%
systems and was rejected by them
um

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
child had disability i don't know if
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
and also if you take a look at our open
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh statute um it provides the
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
ability to um accept students or not
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
accept students based on academic
 
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.390 align:start position:0%
accept students based on academic
criteria

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
um how do
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
how would that fit into um this
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
legislation um thank you for the
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
question representative cordelli i i
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
in fact one of the things that kind of
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
sparked my mind
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
was that very testimony that we had here
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
it was under manifest hardship and the
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
parent came in and was very distressed
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
that she had fought quite a bit
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
for her child
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
on manifest hardship
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
to get this the public school she was
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to to
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
relocate her to to another public school
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
which she did through hearings with the
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
state school board
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
she then
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
the school that the child wanted to go
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
to the local public or another public
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
school nearby that the child wanted to
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
go to child was rejected
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
and i think if this law were in place
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
and the child was rejected because
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the disability
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
then i think they would have another
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
quite another case as well i don't think
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
rep san luna and just a quick follow-up
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
on that thank you very much mr chair um
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that um that when a a
 
00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.430 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that um that when a a
student

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
is is is placed or
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
requests a reassignment through manifest
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
hardship from one
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
school district to another school
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
district that if that student has an iep
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
the whole the district of residence
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
covers the cost associated with that
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
individualized educational
 
00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.350 align:start position:0%
individualized educational
plan

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
yes thanks for that question yes it does
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
um we we've had that numerous times so
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
further questions rep senator tanner i
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
would you believe that we have
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
and talked about the same scenario that
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and represent
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
luna have
 
00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:15.190 align:start position:0%
luna have
addressed

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
with a student that comes from is in
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
district a and would like to go to
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
district b
 
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.710 align:start position:0%
district b
that

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
we have a statute which allows district
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
b to refuse that
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
if there's carrying forth
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
and they want to go enroll in that
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
school and they're not
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
not a resident of that school district
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
the school district can reject
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
that individual from coming in due to
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
that ongoing costs are going to be
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
incumbent on that citizenry
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
and uh so
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
the end result is
 
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
the end result is
that

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
many schools are no longer accepting
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
students from a
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
ascending district those that are out of
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
district schools will not accept those
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
from another district would you believe
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
that to be the case um and not
 
00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:09.190 align:start position:0%
that to be the case um and not
discriminatory

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
i guess i guess my feeling on that
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
particular scenario where you're saying
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
they don't accept them because they're
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
not residents of the area
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
we have a public school system
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
that's set up on
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
providing free open public education to
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
students within their
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
district within their
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
geographic area that's that's their
 
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.909 align:start position:0%
geographic area that's that's their
charge

00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
um that's the charge of
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh free public education
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's like a cornerstone of democracy
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that um
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
we've now made public we've now made
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
public education fluid
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
because we've made public education and
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
public dollars fluid
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
and once we started doing that then i
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
think we need a law like this to cover
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
situations where discrimination plays in
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're going to get you know i
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
remember seeing a cartoon one time that
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
said you know that the new school is you
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
know a blue school a red school a yellow
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
school a green school and only green
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
people can go to green school
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
and it silos everybody whereas the
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
public schools are a melting pot they're
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
they're america they're a foundation of
 
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.230 align:start position:0%
they're america they're a foundation of
america

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
america
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is intended to keep
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
so i i really didn't get a response to
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
my question is it
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
is it uh okay for a receiving school to
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
say no we're not going to take this
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
student this could eventually be a
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid situation in which this
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
small district you want to go to cannot
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
come up with the 250 000 annually well
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's just what representative luna was
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
pointing out that this ascending school
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
is responsible for the iep
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
and the iep is what designates whether
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's an out of district placement or not
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
or whether
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know whatever is going to happen and
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
they assume
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for that
 
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.470 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for that
iep

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
iep
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to follow up just one more
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
step on that would you believe that the
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
iep is being addressed in the present
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
school district however not to the level
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
that the parent accepts
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
so they're looking next door to another
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
district and they want that district to
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
deliver the service they want
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
the receiving district in this case
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
i believe should have the right to
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
reject that enrollment of that student
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
do you believe the same um i believe
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
that special ed has a system set up
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
a very good system set up and we're
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
we've been tweaking it right along to
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
address issues like this and i think
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
that that is a very specific issue that
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily
 
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.710 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily
um

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
indicative or representative of this
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
bill that i'm putting forth i think
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's a specialized area i think it's a
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
special situation
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
and we have uh all kinds of of ways to
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicate that through our special ed
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh division thank you
 
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.230 align:start position:0%
uh division thank you
just

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
real quickly mr chair i think when um uh
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
as as testimony continues on on this
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill that might be a very good question
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
to take up with school boards
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
association that i think we worked
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with we have discussed
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
this issue regarding special ed and that
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
many many times here
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
and there are some real significant
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
financial issues associated with it but
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
i think we could get into a technical i
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
think we can do that thank you uh
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock did you have your
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you chairman uh thank you for
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
taking another question you're getting
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
varieties over there i was thinking
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
about the the uh scenario that chairman
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
ladd presented
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh within my district this is factual
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
within my district we have multiple
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
small little towns and each town pays
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
for the small little school before they
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
go to high school uh we have one town
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
that is is more successful uh
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
academically and has more resources to
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
put in there
 
00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:10.789 align:start position:0%
put in there
uh

00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:12.230 align:start position:0%
uh
if

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
our other towns want to transfer the
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
youngst to that separate school school
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
district in that region
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
and they are categorically saying no
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
because the local people say no we're
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
paying the proportion of the for our
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
children would that be discrimination if
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
they say no across the board
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
discrimination depends on protected
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
classes and that's what the law does
 
00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:36.470 align:start position:0%
classes and that's what the law does
so

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
a school district
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
my school district has the ability
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
wants has voted and wanted the ability
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
to take in students as tuition
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to set parameters on how
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
many they can take
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
under this law they could not refuse
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
them if they came if it was specific to
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
a protected class
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative mullen then
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
quick one mr chair thank you uh
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
question so
 
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.909 align:start position:0%
question so
this

00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the section that has to
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
do with the duties of the state board of
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
education and i'm looking at the
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
additions of
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
classes that were not in the original
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
protected classes that were not in the
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
original definition
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
am i correct that the definition that is
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
here already appears in other places in
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statute as the list of
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
protected classes yes
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a follow-up yes
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
and that our public schools use this
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
definition of protected classes in
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
somebody is being discriminated against
 
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
right as as indicated in my handout 193
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
colon 38
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
is the is that and
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's also provided in rsa
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
354-a colon 27-28
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
so why wouldn't we ex expect the state
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
board of education to follow the
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
definition of discrimination and
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
protected classes i do no why wouldn't
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
we expect the state board of edge oh you
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
do you do expect them i do okay all
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
right thank you i thought you were
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%

i'm trying to figure out what might
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
happen to
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
a school a public school
 
00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:43.990 align:start position:0%
a school a public school
if

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.710 align:start position:0%
if
the

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
education freedom account program
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
becomes wildly popular
 
00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:52.069 align:start position:0%
becomes wildly popular
and

00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
the children who stay
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
at the public school
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
are the ones who
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
the other schools won't accept the kids
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
that have learning disabilities or the
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
kids that have
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
disrupted families or bad behavior or
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
need to be toileted and have their
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
diapers changed and those type of things
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
that those are the children who are left
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
in the public school um
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
could that is is that a
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
scenario that could possibly happen
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
if things if this bill is not enacted
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
well um thank you for that question um
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
when i was in college i worked a couple
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
of summers at state schools one in
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania and one in massachusetts
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
and i think we all
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
have at least some
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
historical perspective on what state
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
schools were
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
a warehouse for the disabled the
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
warehouse for the
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
handicapped warehouse for the poor in
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
many instances the mentally incompetent
 
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.310 align:start position:0%
many instances the mentally incompetent
and

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
and we know
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
that our our society has totally
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
rejected that
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
understands how these people are
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
our people
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
can be productive
 
00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:14.630 align:start position:0%
can be productive
uh

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
to whatever level they can be
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
in society and i certainly would hate to
 
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.910 align:start position:0%
in society and i certainly would hate to
see

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
our public schools become
 
00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:25.030 align:start position:0%
our public schools become
uh

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
a ghost of that i guess
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%

held to the same standards and be

sound inclusive but
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
the question we should be asking is
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
what are they leaving out of their
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination policy
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
take a religious high school in

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good start
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
but what protects this high school's
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
students and prospective students and
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%

their tax dollars used
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
to exclude young people from attending

take a private school at my district
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
there's a different school this one's
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
non-religious uh as another example on
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
its website it says there shall be no
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
again it's a good start
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's a good start but what protects
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
students or
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
prospective students of this private
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
school from being discriminated against
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
on the basis of physical or mental
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
disability or economic status granite
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
staters deserve to know that their tax
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
dollars will not be used to exclude
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
young people from attending schools that
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
discriminate against students or their
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
families for any reason
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%

programs activities and employment
practices

00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
under current law and in reading the
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
posted policies of many private and
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
religious schools across our state
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination discrimination against
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
our young people appears to be legal
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's not the new hampshire way and we
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
have an obligation and an opportunity
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
today to do something about it
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
if non-public schools wish to receive
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
public funds then we should fully expect
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
them to not discriminate against their
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
students potential students staff
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
administrators or board members
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise school choice
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
should be limited to public charter
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
schools which as public schools it's my
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that they're held to the
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
same basic standards of decency
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
inclusion and non-discrimination as
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
every other public school in our state i
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
know i'm not alone in my belief that it
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
is completely reasonable expectation
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
that taxpayer dollars should be
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited from being used to
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
discriminate against our children
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues i urge you to send house bill
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
1607 to the house floor with a strong
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan recommendation of ought to
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
holderness academy or
 
00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.710 align:start position:0%
holderness academy or
um

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%

other private uh institution
um

um
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
should be required
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
to accept
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%

say a student who has
a

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%

um regardless of their ability to pay
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
tuition uh that's correct i think it's
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the institution uh the
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
educational institution to provide
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh additional scholarship funds so that
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
student can attend if they're accepting
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
public monies they should not be able to
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%

thank you representative for the
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
i will say this i'm not i'm not an
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
expert in
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
education funding

in the state of new hampshire
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%

00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
public funds that flow into in you know
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%

then that we should have some basic
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
expectations for transparency
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
and non-discrimination thanks further

00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
new futures is a non-partisan nonprofit

organization that advocates educates and

collaborates to improve the health and
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
wellness of all new hampshire residents
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
i'm here in support of house bill 1607
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
which would expand the duty of the state
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
board of education to ensure that all
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire students have equal access
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
to educational resources
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
in any
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
institution or program that accepts
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
first this bill is important because it
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
would affect and improve the overall
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of new hampshire's
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
youth by addressing inequity in
 
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.230 align:start position:0%
youth by addressing inequity in
education

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
this would expand the duty of the state
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
board of education to ensure no unlawful
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination in any private school
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
tuition program or educational service
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
program which receives public funds
 
00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:46.150 align:start position:0%
program which receives public funds
um

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
would reduce the
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
any discrimination and therefore offer
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
all students the ability to access
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
public education or private education
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
regardless of many of the protected
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
statuses that you've heard today
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
education is one of the social
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
determinants of health and therefore
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
when students are able to access
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
better education and educational
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
resources their overall health and
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
second house bill 1607 addresses

second house bill 1607 addresses

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
educational
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
inequity by expanding the protected
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
populations to include gender identity
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation religious creed and
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
physical or mental disability it is
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
estimated that approximately 8 000
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
students in new hampshire identify
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
identify as part of the lgbt
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus community
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
and that 450 approximately identify as
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
transgender additionally 15.3 percent of
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire students in public schools
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
have received some form of special
 
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.510 align:start position:0%
have received some form of special
education

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
historically these populations have
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
struggled to access resources
 
00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore have had lower academic
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
successes and i've cited some resources
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
that you can follow up on or i'm happy
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
to provide further resources if you have
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
any questions on that
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
expanded the expanding these protections
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
to these
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
protected classes would strengthen their
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
ability to reach the same academic
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
successes as their counterparts and
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
again this would contribute to their
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
overall health and wellness
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
for these reasons new futures strongly
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
supports house bill 1607 and would
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
recommend that this committee
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
recommend it to the full houses ought to
 
00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:26.069 align:start position:0%
recommend it to the full houses ought to
pass

00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
i see are both uh related so um and you
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
have down three and three so it means
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
each one of you has about three minutes
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
hi i'm steven scare 111 east hobart
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
street in nashua
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm here as a private citizen asking
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
you to oppose
 
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.349 align:start position:0%
you to oppose
1607

00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
1607
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm especially concerned about the
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
wording regarding gender
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
identity a girl
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
is a young human female and a female is
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
a person bearing two x chromosomes in
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
the cell nuclei and normally having a
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
uterus and ovaries
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
a boy is a young human male
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
no one
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
can provide a substantially different
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
definition of a boy or a girl that
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't rely on circular reasoning or
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
gender stereotypes
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
so one question before this committee
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
is whether the state should coerce
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
private schools
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
including religious schools to pretend
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
that girls are boys
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
and boys our girls by withholding funds
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
until recently it would have been
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
self-evidently wrong to try to force
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
people to act and speak against reason
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
and conscience in order to spare
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
someone's feelings
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
and gender identity laws have quickly
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
made a farce of woman sports
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
as big strong men run away with women's
 
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.109 align:start position:0%
as big strong men run away with women's
trophies

00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
trophies
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
but i especially ask the committee to
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
consider the carnage caused by passing
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
laws promoting gender ideology
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
i had a brilliant but troubled niece
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
who has persuaded she could transition
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
into a boy and all her problems would be
 
00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.270 align:start position:0%
into a boy and all her problems would be
solved

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
solved
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
with a cross-sex hormone solved nothing
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
they left her body irreversibly damaged
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
how was this directed to the to the bill
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
i think he said in terms of in terms of
 
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.109 align:start position:0%
i think he said in terms of in terms of
non-discrimination

00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
well it talks about gender identity in
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
this bill and he's talking to gender
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
identity so this is not a bill about
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
about gender identity this is a bill
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
she fell into addiction and homelessness
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
she died of an overdose at 21 days
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
just after talking about suicide
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
advocates of child transgenderism claim
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
detransitioners and people that have
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
trouble adjusting
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
didn't get the support they needed from
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
their families
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
but the almost 26 000 members
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
of the detransition subreddit page tell
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
a different story
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
the transitioners recount how they had
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
trouble fitting in with other girls
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
because they didn't fit stereotypes how
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
they were drawn into transgenderism by
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
the social media and how they were
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
rushed through medicalization by
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
therapists and physicians who didn't
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
explore whether the gender dysphoria was
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
a result of other mental health
 
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.589 align:start position:0%
a result of other mental health
disorders

consequences for women's sports

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
this bill does not deal with women's
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
sports this d bill deals with whether or
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
not public funds can be used to pay the
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
tuition for students in private or
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
we're looking at discrimination of a
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
receiving school denying acceptance
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh based upon a student's
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
characteristics that we've had here
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
gender sex identity et cetera
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
please focus on that i read in the bill
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
that it prohibited any discrimination i
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
assumed that meant all the schools
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
programs all public and all private yep
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
so this is about a public program
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
this is about school programs where they
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
have sports
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
a sports program at a school or an
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me mental chair
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
rips on luna i'm the best very specific
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
on on the protector if there is a
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
receiving school has a sports program
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
and we've had that discussion before
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
even when this was not a topic
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the student going to the school that
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
might be a great hockey player and
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
another student that has an iep
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
we were trying to keep the
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
accepting both students not just one
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
while we need a forward and the hockey
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
team and we're going to deny the iep
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
because of this that's clear
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination we've had that
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
discussion here many times in past years
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
i don't see any problem with where we're
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
going with this discussion that beth is
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%

young women in their confidence
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%

posing as their peers
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%

for any of the reasons laid out in the
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation before you today we
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
must hold every school to the same
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
standard in this regard whether public
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
or private house bill 1607 makes it
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
crystal clear that the state board of
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
education our board of directors for
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
education in new hampshire
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%

we hope and urges committee will ensure
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
swift passage of house bill 1607 so our
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%

committing public funds toward our
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%

belief is any school that's getting any

public money and if tax credits come
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
from any sort of public money they
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there shouldn't be any
 
00:59:24.559 --> 00:59:28.069 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there shouldn't be any
discrimination

i've been asked by many parents

of transgender children to help in
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
situations where their transgender child

faces discrimination from school boards

although it may not be clear from my
 
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.870 align:start position:0%
although it may not be clear from my
handout

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
handout
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
is that we're starting to see
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
educational freedom accounts being used
 
01:00:50.319 --> 01:00:51.109 align:start position:0%
educational freedom accounts being used
to

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
to fund non-public schools but we're
 
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.670 align:start position:0%
to fund non-public schools but we're
also

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
running into situations that go beyond
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
the original scope of our
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the statutes that we've already put
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
in place
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
a situation that i
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
was made aware of shortly after becoming
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
a school board member
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
is that a local religious school
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
had run into a situation
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
where a senior
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.319 --> 01:01:25.589 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
non-public school a religious school
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
convince that student not to come out
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
as a transgender
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
male the parents were fully supportive
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
of this child
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately the school banned that
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
student from the school
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
the property
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
that the school existed on
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
ability for the local school boards of
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
that community to input into the system
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
and that's that student was
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
 
01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.069 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
and

01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
they did find a public school
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
to take them in with open arms
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
not in new hampshire
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
in another other situations i've run
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
into is that parents have come to me
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
where local school boards have taken the
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire school board association's
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
policy on support of
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
transgender students and environment
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
and have modified it to the point
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
where the community has decided that any
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
student that's coming out as lgbt
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
should be reported to the students
 
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.670 align:start position:0%
should be reported to the students
parents

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
even if the student is in the process of
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand their gender
 
01:02:47.839 --> 01:02:49.109 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand their gender
identity

01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
identity
 
01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:52.230 align:start position:0%
identity
or

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
in this hearing the discussion this
 
01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.710 align:start position:0%
in this hearing the discussion this
morning

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
i've heard a number of
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
things about students
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
transferring to other schools and i've
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
been involved with the process where a
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
student was being bullied in one
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
environment and had to move to another
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
those discussions come to the school
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
boards to make a decision because
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
those local communities need to fund
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
that student going to another school and
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
that school the school they're targeting
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to also has to accept
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
that student in response to your
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
question representative ladd
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
both school systems need to be in
 
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.670 align:start position:0%
both school systems need to be in
agreement

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
that they can transfer
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
i also ran into a situation where we did
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
have a student with an iep that wanted
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
to transfer to a local
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
another community
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
and we ended up working on an
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
arrangement where the paraprofessional
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
associated with giving the care to that
 
01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.710 align:start position:0%
associated with giving the care to that
student

01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
also was was moved
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
and we split the cost on the
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
the paraprofessional being in that other
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
the challenge
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
we're running into and we'll see more of
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
as as we spend educational freedom
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
account money
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
to other schools is to ensure that the
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
policies related to
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination for all students
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
is it here to
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
and the question is come up about tax
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
dollars being spent in here
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
my my opinion
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
is that the educational freedom account
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
would not exist if it weren't for
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
so these are taxpayer dollars being used
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
to fund education
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
through an alternative mechanism
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
and so i feel that we're spending
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
the same money we would on a public
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
school as we would for non-public school
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
and they should adhere to the same
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
statutes a public school needs to as far
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
as non-discrimination
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote not to pass on this
 
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.230 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote not to pass on this
bill

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%

cannon uh are there
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
questions of the representative
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
from the human rights commission
 
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:39.750 align:start position:0%
from the human rights commission
welcome

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
good morning uh
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
chairland and to the rest of the
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
education committee
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
my name is ani malachi i'm the director
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
of the human rights commission
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
i had not planned to speak i was simply
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
going to listen
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
to see if there was any clarification
 
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
that might be needed relative to
 
01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.190 align:start position:0%
that might be needed relative to
anti-discrimination

01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
statutes and here we are so um there
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
have been a lot of points that have been
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
made this morning
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
um my focus is certainly not going to be
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
on rsa 193 that is not my lip my area of
 
01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.630 align:start position:0%
on rsa 193 that is not my lip my area of
expertise

01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
however um looking at
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation um
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
house bill 1607
 
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:41.029 align:start position:0%
house bill 1607
um

01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
in looking at that through the lens of
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
with the language that is being sought
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
to be added to rsa 193
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
and dealing with the state board of
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
education to be the
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
adjudicator or the enforcer of the
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
additional language
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
it is my belief that this will create
 
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.190 align:start position:0%
it is my belief that this will create
confusion

01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
there isn't a mechanism specifically
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
expressly discussed here as to how if
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
someone's been
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
if they feel they've been discriminated
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
against how they would go about
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
making that claim and then walking
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
through that process
 
01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.190 align:start position:0%
through that process
and

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
although representative tanner did state
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
that the human rights commission does
 
01:07:29.119 --> 01:07:30.150 align:start position:0%
that the human rights commission does
handle

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
handle
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
public accommodation employment and
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
housing we are set up to handle
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
education as of 2019 the legislature
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
decided that that was part of our
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional authority and it was
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
something that we needed to be
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
responsible for and therefore we are
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
so adding education
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
which means k through 12 education
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
public schools are included and i
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
believe if if the scheme of what a
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
public school is under edu under the
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
department of education if it includes
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
charter schools then charter schools are
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
included what is not expressly included
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
in our in our statute
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
is private schools or non-public schools
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
and if that's something that the
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
legislature decides that we need to do
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
then that's up to you all we will abide
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
by whatever you've added to our statute
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
to then have authority over and to
 
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.789 align:start position:0%
to then have authority over and to
enforce

01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
the anti-discrimination laws
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
as they would read in our statute
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
to add to that
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
we are and have been set up to receive a
 
01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.950 align:start position:0%
we are and have been set up to receive a
claim

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
claim
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
to pass on a claim
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
or and if we do receive it then we also
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
have the authority and the expertise to
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
do the investigation that's necessary
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
and then to move that along by offering
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
mediation by having conversations with
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
both parties by then moving forward with
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
a charge
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me with a finding of
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
discrimination if the investigation
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
warrants that as well as allowing for a
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
if the individual decided they wanted to
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
take it to court they have that
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity and the way that the statute
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
was written when it when education was
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
added to the human rights commission it
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
allowed for what the lawyers in the room
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
would call a true choice of forum which
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
means that if i'm a parent and i have an
 
01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.870 align:start position:0%
means that if i'm a parent and i have an
issue

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
i feel my child is being discriminated
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
against and i don't want to go to the
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
commission i want to take it to court
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
because i have a a lawyer that's going
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
to represent me i can go right to court
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
and you follow that court process or if
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
they decided they needed to do something
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
through the attorney general's office
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
they have the opportunity
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
however if they decided they wanted to
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
come to the commission they can
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
certainly do that excuse me they could
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
certainly do that as well
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
we do not charge any fees we are a state
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
funded and we do have some partial
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
funding from the federal government
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
specifically in the area of employment
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
and you do not have to have an attorney
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
to move through our process what some
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
individuals will do is file a charge and
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
once it's been accepted sometimes an
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
attorney will pick them up and represent
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
them throughout the remainder of our
 
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
them throughout the remainder of our
process

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
there are also times where someone once
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
they've received a probable cause
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
finding then they will find an attorney
 
01:10:23.199 --> 01:10:24.070 align:start position:0%
finding then they will find an attorney
and

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
once you have probable cause there's
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
still another opportunity to mediate
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that means it's really called
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
conciliation at that point where if the
 
01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.310 align:start position:0%
conciliation at that point where if the
parent

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
simply wants the behavior to stop or
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
they want the child to be included in
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
whatever it is then they have that
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity um again all of this is free
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
of charge because we are funded by uh
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
the state primarily uh basically it's an
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
8515 split
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
with that being said religious
 
01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.350 align:start position:0%
with that being said religious
organizations

01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
which are not just i think when we hear
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
the word religious organization we
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
automatically assume christian but if
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's a hindu organization a muslim
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
organization a jewish organization an
 
01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.870 align:start position:0%
organization a jewish organization an
employer

01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
a club
 
01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.510 align:start position:0%
a club
a

01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
school even a group
 
01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.510 align:start position:0%
school even a group
educational

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
educational
 
01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.790 align:start position:0%
educational
opportunity

01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
all of those are exempt which
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
therein allows people to if you're
 
01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.270 align:start position:0%
therein allows people to if you're
working

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
in a secular position and you have a and
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
you're requiring a religious exemption
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
then there are
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines and
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
areas of the statute that specify for
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions if i'm an employee
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
and there are also employers that are
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
religious entities and they have
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions that are provided for in our
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
statute as well
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
should someone have
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
any issues under and then they are a
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
member of a protected class and they
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
have questions or concerns uh they think
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
they might be being discriminated
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
against then they should absolutely
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
reach out to the commission and we can
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
field those questions
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
we do have people that
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
may feel so i think someone mentioned
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
ieps and although we do handle education
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
ieps are not our area of expertise and
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
if we had a situation and there could
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
potentially be something where
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
a child's iep is not being fully met
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that could be
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
discriminatory so
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
if that were the situation and the
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
parent filed a charge with us and we
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
took that charge because it seemed clear
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
that there was some discriminatory
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
action as to why the child's iep wasn't
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
being met we would handle the
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
discriminate the area of discrimination
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
that we have jurisdiction over and we
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
would work with the department of
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
education to deal with the iep uh to
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
your point chairman ladd yes there are
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
parents who want
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
an iep
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
handled in a particular way
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
and they may not get their way and so
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
they feel the child is being
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
discriminated against based on
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
in their estimation it would be based on
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
a disability which that would allow them
 
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
a disability which that would allow them
to

01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
file a charge with us because we have
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over disability but then
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
once it comes to us we have the
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
ability to take that charge because we
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
clearly see something there or to pass
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
on that charge because it's not that the
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
iep wasn't being met they wanted
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
additional items and those items
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
weren't happening
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so there's a process for that
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
so my
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
my concern would be
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
is that if
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
this is potentially added
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
where are parents going and who are they
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
going to are they coming to us are they
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
going to court are they going to the
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
state board of education at what part
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
are we sharing information because our
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
process is
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
is confidential up to
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
probable cause so if
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
if a parent files a charge
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
we're not telling the media that these
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
charges were filed against this school
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
district and these are the things that
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
happen we we don't have that
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
conversation we have a confidential
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
process which is to the to the
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's better for for all involved now at
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
a certain point that information can
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
become public because if we're having a
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
public hearing which all of our hearings
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
are the public will be informed it's you
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
know x versus y and if they would like
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
to watch those proceedings then they
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
certainly can
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
but i think we are all the human rights
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
commission is already established to
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
take these these cases take and pass
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
upon these cases we have been since 2019
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
and so i would be a little concerned
 
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.910 align:start position:0%
and so i would be a little concerned
about

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
what the process would look like and
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
who's tracking these how how is it going
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
to work as it relates to who would come
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the commission versus who would go to
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
the state board of education i'm sure
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
i've missed a lot of points that were
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
made earlier there was so much
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
conversation but i'll end my comments
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
there and i'm absolutely available for
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have thank
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much real
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
helpful information you've presented
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
i have one question uh and it deals with
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
process because i i don't really have
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
the total process put together in my
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
head but you see
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
that a step after
 
01:15:27.199 --> 01:15:28.070 align:start position:0%
that a step after
the

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
the statute says the state board of
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
education shall ensure that
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination doesn't occur
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
in k through well it doesn't say k-12
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
but it is k-12 public education
 
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.270 align:start position:0%
but it is k-12 public education
um

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
if in fact a person comes to you and
 
01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.830 align:start position:0%
if in fact a person comes to you and
says

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
i have a concern here i want to have you
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
resolve this issue which i feel we're
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with discrimination
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
would it be likely that your your
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
commission would say have you dealt with
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
the state board of education which has
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to ensure no
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination occurs have you gone in
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
them and had you have you had any
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
closure or discussion or recommendation
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
from that board so is that a step prior
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
to coming to you um thank you so much
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
for the question that is an excellent
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
question and i have no idea
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
um at this point we don't have to do
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
that someone can come to us unfettered
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
and file a charge
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
if this is passed then we would
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
certainly have to figure it out whether
 
01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.950 align:start position:0%
certainly have to figure it out whether
it's

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's the human rights commission
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the state board of education through
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
the assistance of the attorney general's
 
01:16:34.239 --> 01:16:35.750 align:start position:0%
the assistance of the attorney general's
office

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
i would imagine that is what would have
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
to happen but at this point if a parent
 
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
comes to us and would like to file a
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
charge um depending on what it is if
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's iep related then we may send them
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
back to the school in question to ask
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
those particular questions
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
but customarily we will take the charge
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
luna sure thank you very much mr chair
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
and thanks very much for uh for offering
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
to um to testify this morning i think
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
you you've raised some good um good good
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
questions here um in your opinion
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
i mean there's obviously a an existing
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh existing language in in statute in
 
01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.910 align:start position:0%
uh existing language in in statute in
18611

01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
18611
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh roman 33
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
that um that this bill amends that's
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
directed to
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
and um and a
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to call it a subset of
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
protected classes because it certainly
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
does not include
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
um some of the language that
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
did put in to to make it a more
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive group of protected classes
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
but do you do you see a um
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know any any sort of issues
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
with the um i guess the lack of
 
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.790 align:start position:0%
with the um i guess the lack of
of

01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the word is no uh
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
the the difference between what's
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
currently in this statute and what uh
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about with the human
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
rights um uh commission and wouldn't we
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
be better off having having something
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
that was maybe more in line and
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
specificity to the protected classes and
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
the students
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
educational environments
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leno for the
 
01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.350 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leno for the
question

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
i would say that i dare not speak to a
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
statute that is not my own
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's a good idea or not a good
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
idea i would not have the expertise uh
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
to to try to dance through the weights
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
and measures of making a statement such
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
as that
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
what i can say is that all citizens are
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
covered by 354a
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
there are protections in place and 354a
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
in in many ways mirrors the the federal
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
civil rights act of 1964.
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
and uh what people
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
what children are specifically protected
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh at this point um is the addition to
 
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
our statute which is uh
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
354-827 i believe in 28
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
those two elements were added when
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
education was added to our statute so so
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's coverage there
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
does it help to have it somewhere else
 
01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.270 align:start position:0%
does it help to have it somewhere else
i

01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to that
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
because in terms of this there there's
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
an enforcement element
 
01:19:39.679 --> 01:19:40.630 align:start position:0%
an enforcement element
so

01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
the enforcement element is where things
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
get confusing
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
does it help to have coverage in
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
different places
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
it would honestly it would depend on
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
who's covering what area does it divide
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
it up does it make it confusing do they
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
all work together um those would be the
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
questions that i would uh have to answer
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
in order to make and
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
to give an opinion on something like
 
01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.790 align:start position:0%
to give an opinion on something like
that

01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman yes so so
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the current statute
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh for example it uh it includes some
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
race but it doesn't include
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
would it be preferable for the current
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
statute to be updated to include the
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
protected classes that are compatible
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
with what the human rights commission
 
01:20:32.239 --> 01:20:33.750 align:start position:0%
with what the human rights commission
addresses

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
that would be a decision between the
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
legislature who's making these decisions
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
as well as the department of department
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
of education
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's already civil rights
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's a civil rights uh not unit but
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
civil the office of civil rights and i
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
know i think i just got that backwards
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
um that is a part of the federal
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
department of education so there are
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
coverage areas that people have access
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
to as well as the specificity in 354-a
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
if you also decide that it needs to be
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere else then that is what will be
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
that is that is something squarely on
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
your shoulders and then the rest of us
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
will have to go about figuring out how
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
this works um and and how to if the
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
pieces are working together or if they
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
are in conflict and we would have to
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
figure out what that system is
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
as chairman lad stated do we need to
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
send them to
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
the state board of education first and
 
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
they exhaust that and then they come to
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
us do they not have to go to them did
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
would it would our statute have to be
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
amended to make that process another
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
part because that's not part of our
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
process currently
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of other questions
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
that need to be asked i'm not weighing
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
in on whether this is a good piece of
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
legislation or not
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
what i'm here to say is
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
what we do at the commission what our
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility is what our raise on debt
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
is every day and that education was
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
added in 2019 with the specificity of
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
the language that is currently being
 
01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:07.669 align:start position:0%
the language that is currently being
proposed

01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
and if this piece of legislation passes
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
there are other elements that have to be
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
considered and looked at so that
 
01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.229 align:start position:0%
considered and looked at so that
the

01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
parents that are filing or making a
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
claim will have clarity on where they're
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
going and what that process is and who
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
they should see first or not see it all
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
or what their options are i think this
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
because it's a bit vague um there's
 
01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:33.830 align:start position:0%
because it's a bit vague um there's
there's

01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
for me a bit of confusion
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
relative to those questions that you
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
asked yeah so so one
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up on that so so if a um
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
if a parent and this goes right to your
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
um your your hypothetical here and tied
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
in with the process that uh that um that
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
chair lad uh mentioned if a parent felt
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
that their student had been
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
discriminated on based on race
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh could they then not follow i mean
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
what would be the process for them now
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
they reach out to us we start with a
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
questionnaire so that we can gather some
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
of the basic information it's basically
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
the who what when where and why a
 
01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.830 align:start position:0%
the who what when where and why a
contact

01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
contact
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
contact information for the parent and
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
then our intake person follows up with
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
them to get clarity on what it is and if
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
it does meet our prima facie standard
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
which is really low you know we take a
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
charge based on what the person is
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
telling us
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know there's not a there's not a
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
huge bar that someone has to cross to
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
get into the door we want to be
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
accessible once that primo fascia uh
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
standard is met and then we take that
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
questionnaire it is then turned into a
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
charge that some that is verified
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
meaning under the pains and penalties of
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
of perjury and that person uh then also
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
has a um
 
01:23:52.239 --> 01:23:54.310 align:start position:0%
has a um
a

01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
the person with the stamp of losing my
 
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.110 align:start position:0%
the person with the stamp of losing my
words

01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you notary
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is a group sport
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
and it's notarized and then once that
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
happens then both parties receive
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
information on the charge and the charge
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
will outline what the parent is saying
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
happened and then the investigation
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
starts after that and it is assigned to
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
an investigator and then they will
 
01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.149 align:start position:0%
an investigator and then they will
interview

01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
interview
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
all of the the parties um they'll invest
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me they'll interview the parent
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
what happened what did you ask for
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
they'll ask all of these questions and
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
then they will talk to the school well
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
so and so said this happened and of
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
course the school will have the actual
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
charge so they'll know what's being
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
alleged and then they are interviewed to
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
get answers and then from there an
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
assessment is made as to if there's
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
enough to move this along if there's
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
enough that there's probable cause
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
and there's also
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
a commissioner that's assigned who will
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
then make that determination
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
and after probable cause is found
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
then there's another uh there's an
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a conciliation which is
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
basically a mediation after probable
 
01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:04.470 align:start position:0%
basically a mediation after probable
cause

01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
cause
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
conciliation happens if it fails then we
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
move on to a public hearing but also at
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
if the respondent whether whoever it is
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's a school district employer
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
whomever they have an opportunity to
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
remove it to court if they would like
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
and then if they don't and they remain
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
with us then a scheduled a hearing is
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
scheduled there are three commissioners
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
who don't know anything about the
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
the charge or the case or the
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
investigation and they are listening to
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
the information to the testimony that's
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
provided with
 
01:25:36.239 --> 01:25:37.910 align:start position:0%
provided with
any

01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
additional information and then a
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
determination is made and from there
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
then whatever that decision is
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
and the the parents are asking for
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
something so
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
that decision is made based on what the
 
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
parents are asking for
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity at that point
 
01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.229 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity at that point
for

01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
any sort of financial relief that can be
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
a part of the our entire process now if
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
we go through the investigation and we
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
get to a no probable cause then the
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
information from the investigation
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
certainly is sent to both parties and
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
then the both parties will know
 
01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.350 align:start position:0%
then the both parties will know
what

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
what information
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh what level it didn't reach so you
 
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
have the lower step of primo facial
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
which is getting in the door the next
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
step is probable cause and so the
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
complainant is is proving their case all
 
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.149 align:start position:0%
complainant is is proving their case all
along

01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
along
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
and if there's not enough information or
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't say not enough information
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
if the investigation does not yield that
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
there was probable cause so maybe there
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
is a non-discriminatory reason that this
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
thing happened with their child at that
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
school and the school would then be
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
incumbent to um to show that it was a
 
01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory reason
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
and then of course if the complainant
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
gets a no probable cause finding they
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to appeal
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
and then when we go to a hearing let's
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
say they get probable cause we go to a
 
01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.390 align:start position:0%
say they get probable cause we go to a
hearing

01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
and they and they don't prevail they
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
still have another opportunity
 
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.629 align:start position:0%
still have another opportunity
to

01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
to appeal
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
long answer to a short question
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
long but thorough
 
01:27:18.239 --> 01:27:19.430 align:start position:0%
long but thorough
mullen

01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
mullen
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question this morning so when
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
i look at the legislation in front in
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
front of me i see two things
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
that are new
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
one is no discrimination
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
in non-public schools that accept public
 
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.870 align:start position:0%
in non-public schools that accept public
funds

01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
and the other
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
is an updated definition of the list of
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
protected classes to match what we
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
already have in statute somewhere else
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
my question to you is this when you talk
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
about the enforcement aspect of this law
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
are you referencing the statement that
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
says ensure that there shall be no
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
unlawful discrimination in any public
 
01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.149 align:start position:0%
unlawful discrimination in any public
school

01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
i i'm speaking in terms of enforcement
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
specifically to what the human rights
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
commission does
 
01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
what the enforcement mechanism would
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
potentially be through the state board
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
of education i do not know i'm not
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
familiar with what enforcement
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
authority they have what jurisdiction
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
they have and what their process is that
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
i do not know i'm speaking specifically
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
for the human rights commission could i
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
just have
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
because my next question was going to be
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
given the fact that they are
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
charged to ensure that there shall be no
 
01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.189 align:start position:0%
charged to ensure that there shall be no
unlawful

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
unlawful
 
01:28:39.199 --> 01:28:40.790 align:start position:0%
unlawful
discrimination

01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
um are you receiving cases
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
from the state board of education is
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
this i know you've said that parents can
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
come forward
 
01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:51.350 align:start position:0%
come forward
but

01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
have you received any inquiries from the

any of the protected classes and
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
potential discrimination i would need to

thank you very much for that um
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
excellent question i would need to
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
follow back up with you to to confirm
 
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:08.950 align:start position:0%
follow back up with you to to confirm
that

01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head which is a scary
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
place but
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
i would dare to say we have not but i
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
would like to confirm that and i'll
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
circle back with the with the committee
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and thank you this

has been very helpful um part of the
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
language in the bill we're looking at
 
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.270 align:start position:0%
language in the bill we're looking at
addresses

01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination because of physical
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
or mental disability is that currently
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
under your purview the current law we
 
01:29:37.679 --> 01:29:39.030 align:start position:0%
under your purview the current law we
have

01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
is that a protected class um thank you
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
very much representative porter um yes
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
it is currently in rsa 354a so all of
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
the protections in the rsa uh when you
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
look in our first paragraph
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
have been extended to areas of
 
01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.189 align:start position:0%
have been extended to areas of
employment

01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
public accommodation housing and then as
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
of 2019 education k-12 education can i
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
so we had a discussion before about um
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if you can answer this
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
but we had a discussion before about
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
a child who might have a mental
 
01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.030 align:start position:0%
a child who might have a mental
disability

01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
disability
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
being accepted or not accepted into a
 
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
non-public school
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
for the gifted for example
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
in your opinion is that what what you
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
deal with as a mental disability would
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
that be
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
covered as a mental disability under the
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
law or would it
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
be fuzzy
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm not thank you for that but i'm
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
not quite clear on the question can you
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
rephrase for me okay so so
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion before about a
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
private school for the gifted and if a
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
child had a mental disability
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
whereby he he or she was not gifted
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
quote unquote that not accepting the
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
child into that school
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
under this language would be
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
discriminating against his him because
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
of his mental disability is that your
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of what mental disability
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination would be
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
in in the workforce or
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
for example if someone applied for a job
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
and they were rejected because they had
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
a mental disability would that be
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
discriminate discriminatory okay so
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to try really hard
 
01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:27.750 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to try really hard
so

01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
i think where we should really start is
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
non-public education uh non-public k-12
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
education is not covered was not added
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
to our statute so so we only have k-12
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh public education and um and if i'm if
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm remembering correctly um if the
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
department of education describes
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools as public schools then
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
they are covered with us as well um
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
to to answer
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
let's look at it as an employment
 
01:31:56.719 --> 01:31:58.950 align:start position:0%
let's look at it as an employment
situation

01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
any what so mental disability as well as
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
physical disabilities those are covered
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
under the ada
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
and if it's a place of work for example
 
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
that that place of work would be
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be required to follow what the ada
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
is however the person who may have a
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
mental or physical disability would need
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
to also meet certain standards so they
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
would have to be able to uh perform the
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
essential functions of any job in order
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
to to to fall under that right and so
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
with an accommodation
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
can they um can they provide can they
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
operate and and manage those essential
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
functions so for example i know this is
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
a little off topic so bear with me but
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
if the person has a visual impairment
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
but all that they need in order to do
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
their work in their cubicle or at the at
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
the widget bench is a magnifying screen
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
so that they can see what's on that
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
screen then there's an accommodation
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's asked for i just need a
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
magnifying screen to be able to do this
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
they receive that screen or should
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
receive that screen and then they're
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
able to do everything else that the job
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
entails if that person is not able to do
 
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
the essential functions of the job eat
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
at in the first place right without the
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
accommodation excuse me even with the
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
accommodation then that's where we get
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
into it really isn't discriminatory
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
right um and hopefully the business
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
would do what they could to to make
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
those changes or or to do the
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
accommodation or to make the adaption
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
for that individual but then there's an
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
undue hardship area so it's a little
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
convoluted there's a lot of things that
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
have to be looked at
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
i've not we have not seen something
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
based on what you're saying in terms of
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
the the mental ability of this person
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
going to the gifted school
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
but we would need to look at all of all
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
of those things to determine so if the
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
parent said my child is being
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
discriminated against because there's a
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
mental disability then we would have to
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
take in all of that information well
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
what what are the guidelines of the
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
school if do they require a certain gpa
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
or a certain iq and if this person
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that then
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
we then have to have that larger
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
conversation and and look at that
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.270 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
woodcock

01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate you taking my
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
question very short very clear i know
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're running late here um is gender
 
01:34:28.239 --> 01:34:29.669 align:start position:0%
we're running late here um is gender
identity

01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
identity
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i know we're running late um new
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a couple of small schools
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
all girls schools so
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
if this were to move forward do you
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
think that the mission of these
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
all-girls schools would be imperiled
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
would the human rights commission have a
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
concern about that
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
um that thank you very very much
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative moffett that is a that is
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
an excellent question um
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
we would have to to look at that and if
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
this were to pass we would have to have
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
a conversation with the attorney
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
general's office you know is there an
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
exemption that's allowed so now
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
religious entities um have exemptions
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and so it's like at this point you
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
know you can't uh force a nunnery to
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
have a priest be a part of their living
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
situation but then that's a religious
 
01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.310 align:start position:0%
situation but then that's a religious
organization

01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
um and religious housing so
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
would there be potential exemptions that
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
a single gender school would have or
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
a particular religious school whether
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's whatever the religion is hindu
 
01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.229 align:start position:0%
it's whatever the religion is hindu
christian

01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
christian
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know whatever um and i think even
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
atheism is covered under religion uh
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions actually so
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
would it would it fit there is that
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
possible so we would have to have those
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
conversations um i would dare not guess
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
on something so important i would
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely have the conversation to to
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
understand if exemptions are allowed and
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
if so then here we are
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
if they aren't allowed then we would
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
have to look at what what that means
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
yes represent luna um thank you very
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
much mr chair in terms of um human
 
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
rights uh commission and and
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination is there a difference
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
between um
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
or or and in particular on this bill do
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
you see a difference between
 
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.109 align:start position:0%
you see a difference between
organizations

01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
that are private and organizations that
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
i mean private and do not accept public
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
funds and organizations that uh that do
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
accept public um tax dollars
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you represent representative
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
juno i'm not sure i understand the
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
question are you specifically speaking
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
of schools or
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
workplaces or
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
right so so thanks i'm i'm really sort
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
of directed to what representative
 
01:36:59.910 --> 01:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
moffett had asked so maybe you do have a
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
small single gender school
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
that is operating
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
without the use of public
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
tax dollars and maybe a a single gender
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
school that or maybe a school that is
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
operating with the use of public tax
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
dollars and is there any
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
a different
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
standard i guess as far as their
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
requirements to comply with
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination statutes okay thank
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
you for that i think i understand you um
 
01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:29.189 align:start position:0%
you for that i think i understand you um
so

01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
if my understanding is clear
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
our purview is public schools period
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
full stop
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
and that does
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
if i'm correct i would include
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
charter schools as well so we do not
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
cover private schools
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
at all so i think your question lends
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
more towards a public versus private and
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
since we don't
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over private schools
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
or non-public schools then i would not
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
really be able to answer your question
 
01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:02.790 align:start position:0%
really be able to answer your question
because

01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
if we did then there wouldn't be a
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
difference right all the schools would
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
be all the schools but we specifically
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
cover public school education k through
 
01:38:11.119 --> 01:38:14.390 align:start position:0%
cover public school education k through
12.

01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
here from the committee not seeing ants
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%

uh

01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%

community
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
and a key aspect of our mission is to
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
fight discrimination
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
in all aspects of public life and
 
01:39:37.119 --> 01:39:38.550 align:start position:0%
in all aspects of public life and
naturally

01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
naturally
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
that includes in education
 
01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.070 align:start position:0%
that includes in education
um

01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start just by laying a
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
foundation of shared values
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
among everyone in this room totally
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
universally shared values
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
we all win when every single student has
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
access to a robust and complete
 
01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.669 align:start position:0%
access to a robust and complete
education

01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that's because today's students are
 
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.270 align:start position:0%
and that's because today's students are
tomorrow's

01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
professionals parents volunteers
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
teachers neighbors voters and our
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
friends they're our community
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
for people who experience discrimination
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
harassment bullying exclusion
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
at school
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
which unfortunately includes many lgbtq
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
young people
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
it is extremely difficult to obtain
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
a quality education
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
this is true
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
no matter whether a student
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
attends school if it's one of new
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire's excellent public schools or
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
if it's another school that's chosen by
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
the student's parents it's always true
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
that it's hard to be uh to achieve a
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
full to obtain a full education if
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
you're being discriminated against
 
01:40:43.199 --> 01:40:44.229 align:start position:0%
you're being discriminated against
um

01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
as this legislature has previously
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
declared decades ago when it instituted
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
the law against discrimination 354-a
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination not only threatens the
 
01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.669 align:start position:0%
discrimination not only threatens the
rights

01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
and proper privileges of new hampshire's
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
inhabitants but menaces the institutions
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
and foundation of a free democratic
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
state and threatens peace order health
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
safety and general welfare of the state
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
so hb 1607 is really sensible
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
legislation i think there's a lot of
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
confusion and with all due respect to
 
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
director malachi i believe that
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
i believe that a lot of her testimony
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
introduced unnecessary confusion into
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
into what the legislation does it's
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
really sensible legislation
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
prior to the enactment of sb 263 which
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
is the 2019 law we've been talking about
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
which expanded nondiscrimination
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
protections to public schools in new
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire prior to that there was uh
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
there was a statute the same statute
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we're amending here part 33 of
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
chapter 186 section 11
 
01:41:48.159 --> 01:41:49.189 align:start position:0%
chapter 186 section 11
which

01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
which required the commissioner to
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that there was no discrimination
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
among certain protected classes in
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
public schools that was true before
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
there were any human rights commission
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
protections extended to uh
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
to to to public school students
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it didn't then it didn't
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
affect the scope of the human rights
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
commission and what it does
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
and it's true today that this amendment
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
isn't going to change or affect the
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
scope of what the human rights
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
commission does okay 354a is not amended
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
by this statute the statute does not
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
create a private right of action for
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
parents to bring discrimination claims
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
it does not do that at all all it does
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
is it expands the scope of what the
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
board of education already does
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh with you know and it's totally
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with the mission statement of
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
the board of education which is to
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
ensure that every individual
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
acquires the skills and knowledge to
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
succeed in a competitive global economy
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
and thrive as a 21st century citizen
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
totally consistent with that objective
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
the state board of education is tasked
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
with eliminating discrimination
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
currently from public schools and this
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill would expand it to private schools
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
that receive public funds
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay it does not create a human rights
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
commission um you know catastrophe that
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
was just uh being being discussed and i
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
want to add something else to that which
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
is that if someone walked into my office
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and told me that they were
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against in a private
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
school because they were gay
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
and i said okay let's uh let's call the
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
school work with them see if we can
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
figure out a resolution that's going to
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
make everyone happy and we're unable to
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
i could make an assessment based on my
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
own understanding of the circumstances
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
and what's going on at the school i
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
might walk into the human rights
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
commission the day after that and say
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
hey i'd like to follow a discrimination
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
claim based on a public accommodation
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
discriminating against this student
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
moreover if it's a boarding school i
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
might also bring a housing claim
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
so 354a does already cover
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination in many contexts
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
including public accommodations and
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
housing which may or may not apply to
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
private schools in different contexts so
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
it's actually i mean all due respect to
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
to director malachi but i believe that
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's very likely the human rights
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
commission would have to process a claim
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
about a private school student who is
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
experiencing discrimination at school
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i think that they would have the the
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
all the tools and resources they would
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
need to do that to handle that claim and
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
they might find that there is no
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination or they might find that
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
there is uh no coverage because it's not
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
a place of public accommodation because
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
it fits into some exemption or whatever
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
and then i could go into superior court
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
and make my case there so that all this
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
is to say that the law remains unchanged
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
with respect to the human rights act um
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes okay
 
01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.350 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes okay
um

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
so there's no substantive change in law
 
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's just it doesn't expand legal
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
protections for vulnerable groups of
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
of students the bill simply expands the
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
role of the state board of education to
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
fulfill its mission
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
i want to point out something that um
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
that rep tanner said which is public
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
funds require public accountability i
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
agree with that statement i think it's a
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
great a great line but i want to clarify
 
01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.189 align:start position:0%
great a great line but i want to clarify
that

01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
that the the objective of the state of
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to end discrimination in
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
all aspects of public life it does not
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
stop at people who receive public funds
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
it includes many private businesses
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
including um i mean as
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
director malachi pointed out it includes
 
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
exemptions for some organizations in
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
some contexts but but for the most part
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
every single organization that employs
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire houses people in
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire or serves the public which
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
includes students
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
has an obligation to to to to act um
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
with without discrimination um toward
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
toward every new hampshire resident
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill is very simple it
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
isn't it isn't it isn't complicated it
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any substantive changes to
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
the law it just tasks the board of
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
education with ensuring that there's no
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination for any student which is
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
something that we all benefit from
 
01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
because every single student should have
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
access to a full and equal education
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say i really urge
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
you to vote to pass on this legislation
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
you had said that a lot of lgbtq
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
children were discriminated in the
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
public schools could you give me an
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
estimate of percent because i know there
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
are a lot of
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
um lgbtq i know there are lgbtq children
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
who are in like the efa program or in
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship program who
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
are there because of
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the public schools
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
do you can you give me any idea how
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
prevalent that is in the public schools
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
yeah um discrimination and harassment
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
and bullying based on lgbtq status is
 
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
extremely common in public schools
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
including in new hampshire and um the
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
most recent
 
01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:54.470 align:start position:0%
most recent
survey

01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
survey
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire schools survey
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
that i saw the results for i think it
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
was over half of
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
lgbtq students report experiencing
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
some form of discrimination bullying
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
harassment at school
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
as an lgbtq student and i totally
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
understand your point which is that
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
students might choose to go to private
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
school to avoid some of the harms that
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
come up in public schools and also some
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
of the laws like h or sorry sb263 which
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
passed in 2019 which expanded
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
protections for uh for for lgbtq
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
students and other students in public
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
schools gave us mechanisms to help
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
work against that kind of discrimination
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
and harassment and i just want to add
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
that like i've worked with a lot of new
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire school principals new
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire school guidance counselors
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
teachers and administrators
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
and 201
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
every single one of these people that
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
i've worked with has a commitment toward
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
ensuring equal educational opportunities
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
for every single student there are not
 
01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:52.719 align:start position:0%
school officials and i and i and i
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
believe this to be true private school
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
officials just the same there is not
 
01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
anyone who is out there trying to harm
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
or limit the opportunities available to
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
students that's not the objective of
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
anybody we need these tools we need
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
rules and policies and uh and tools to
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
help address the situations where people
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do don't have the
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the the bandwidth or don't
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
have the tools they need to stop the
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination before it happens this is
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
just another mechanism to help prevent
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination in schools
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
further questions representative waltz
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i actually have a technical
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
drafting question i understand what the
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
authors of this bill are trying to do
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to
 
01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:35.910 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to
just

01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
draw your attention do you have a copy
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill in front of you i do okay
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to draw your attention to lines
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
11 and 12.
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
so it says that there's no lawful
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination in any public school
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
private school
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
approved tuition program
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
or educational service that receives
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
public funds
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
it looks like educational service that
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
receives public funds as a separate
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
category which would then mean this
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
applies to
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
private schools that don't necessarily
 
01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:07.350 align:start position:0%
private schools that don't necessarily
receive

01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
funds in the way it's drafted am i
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly is it in context
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
elsewhere it says i mean i know exactly
 
01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
what the intent of the bill is but i'm
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
concerned about the way it's drafted
 
01:49:19.679 --> 01:49:20.709 align:start position:0%
concerned about the way it's drafted
um

01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know i think that's an astute
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
observation i do think that there's uh
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
an ambiguity there if not um you know if
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
not just confusion um and i and i
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
totally understand what you mean and
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
that that that could be um
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
that could be amended if you want or it
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
could be uh you know kept to the way it
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
is and i don't and i don't think that it
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
you know necessarily will be interpreted
 
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
one way or the other i'm not gonna i'm
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
not gonna speculate as to how it would
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately be interpreted but i do think
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's an astute observation okay thank
 
01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.270 align:start position:0%
that's an astute observation okay thank
you

01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you very much
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair um you you uh you talked about
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
um public schools and i just wanted to
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
ask you about
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
situations where you might be aware of
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination in private schools
 
01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:05.750 align:start position:0%
discrimination in private schools
and

01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
particularly on the basis of sex gender
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
identity sexual orientation race
 
01:50:11.119 --> 01:50:12.149 align:start position:0%
identity sexual orientation race
religious

01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:50:12.159 --> 01:50:13.910 align:start position:0%
religious
creed

01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
creed
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
and and if if any of that is going on
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
either nationally
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
or in the state of new hampshire
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's true that regardless of where
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
people go to school when they're
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and part of a vulnerable
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
minority and have differences that
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
separate them from other people they are
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
bound to experience different forms of
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
exclusion harassment
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
harassment at the hands of other
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
students sometimes at the hands of
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
teachers and and and um and bullying
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
this this this happens with frequency
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
whenever somebody is different from
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
other people and
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
um and and yes it happens in private
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
schools and i am not i'm not of the
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
opinion that it's worse or better in
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
private schools it's just the same it's
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
the same thing everywhere you go
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh and a quick follow-up on that mr
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
chair so so to representative walls
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
question um and and actually to to
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard um this morning
 
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
there may be private schools that are
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
that are single gender private schools
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
there may be private schools that
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on religion there may
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
be private schools that discriminate
 
01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:24.629 align:start position:0%
be private schools that discriminate
on

01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:51:24.639 --> 01:51:25.589 align:start position:0%
on
on

01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:51:25.599 --> 01:51:26.790 align:start position:0%
on
other

01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.070 align:start position:0%
other
conditions

01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
and protected classes
 
01:51:30.639 --> 01:51:31.830 align:start position:0%
and protected classes
but

01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
could there
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
also be a
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
i guess a different level of
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
of non-discrimination
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
requirement or a non-discrimination
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
standard for private schools that are
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
funded with public money as opposed to
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
private schools that are not funded with
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
public tax dollars
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you rep luna but i would ask
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
for a little more clarification about
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
what you're asking i i i followed you
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
but i would and i think the
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
clarification goes to how the bill is um
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
is worded here and whether or not the
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
state has an obligation to ensure that
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
that private institutions that are
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
funded with public tax dollars are free
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
from discrimination right so so it's not
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
clear to me
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
based on what i what i read here whether
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
or not a private school that say limited
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
um limited admission to a single sex to
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
like an all-girls school whether that
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
would be a violation or not of this of
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
this law it's possible that it would be
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
interpreted that way i i will just say
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
that it would require the board of
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
education to interpret and enforce it
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
that way for that to be the outcome
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
right and um i i i'm actually not aware
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure members of this committee
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
are aware of whether or not there are
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
all girls programs um or schools in
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
better public schools in new hampshire
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
um there there might very well be
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
programs or or opportunities that are
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
only available to girls within the
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
public school system and
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know there's non-discrimination
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
protections that prohibit discrimination
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
based on sex in new hampshire and public
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
schools already but those programs would
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
ostensibly continue to exist i think
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's just a question of whether or not
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's an understanding that certain
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
programs exist to remediate past
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination and whether those would
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know then be a violation of the law
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
but i i don't think there's a per se
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
answer to that question does that help
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
this concludes the hearing for this bill
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
and will take about two or three minutes
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
to prepare and get into the next bill
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.840 --> 01:55:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.840 --> 01:57:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:09.840 --> 01:58:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:52.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
i think we're just about set to get
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
started with
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
yeah we're
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit behind schedule so maybe we
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
can catch up
 
01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:11.270 align:start position:0%
can catch up
um

01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:12.550 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
the next bill is house bill 16-7
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the content of an adequate
 
01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:20.790 align:start position:0%
relative to the content of an adequate
education

01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:22.149 align:start position:0%
education
and

01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'll uh
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
call on the
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%

01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
my mic's on
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
i got the pink card in up there
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to introduce hb 1671
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
i'm rick ladd representative rick ladd
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
from haverhill new hampshire
 
01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:57.589 align:start position:0%
from haverhill new hampshire
um

01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
as you may recall
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
previously in the past
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
session we had hb 242
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
which was one of the bills which was
 
02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
vetoed and sustained the veto was
 
02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:09.270 align:start position:0%
vetoed and sustained the veto was
sustained

02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
sustained
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
and we have gone now
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
onto this step right here and it was
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
vetoed because there wasn't uh that bill
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
had not been quite quite crafted the way
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
we would like to see it done
 
02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:22.229 align:start position:0%
we would like to see it done
and

02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
i think that we have now put together a
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill here which is uh much much better
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
and will will
 
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
meet some of the needs that we have
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
within the state especially the needs
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
which are existing right now
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
where after this pandemic
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
we you know i attended a school board
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
meeting last night and got out around 11
 
02:00:42.159 --> 02:00:43.109 align:start position:0%
meeting last night and got out around 11
30.

02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
30.
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
um and we're we're hearing information
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
where our students achievement wise is
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
not where we want it we know that the
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
statewide achievement in mathematics has
 
02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
dropped significantly
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
um 48
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
proficient to 38 proficient in the
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
district i was working with it's much
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
lower than 38 proficient we also know
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
there's huge blocks of students which
 
02:01:05.679 --> 02:01:06.629 align:start position:0%
there's huge blocks of students which
are

02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
are just plain absent over 20 of the
 
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
school days
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
and some of it's directly related to
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
covid some is that we just don't know
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
and and so there's a lot of issues and
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
call for what are we going to do to try
 
02:01:21.599 --> 02:01:22.629 align:start position:0%
call for what are we going to do to try
to

02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
support the achievement in the state and
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with our instruction and our
 
02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:28.950 align:start position:0%
dealing with our instruction and our
content

02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
content
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
and uh we we need to get on it and do
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
something quickly i know the esr monies
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
have been used to help remediation etc
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
but what my concern is that we've come
 
02:01:41.910 --> 02:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
in the state to believe that
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instruction are totally
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
the responsibility local
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
and then we're also looking at siloing
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum from instruction and i don't
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
think you can do that so when we're
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
talking about the content of an adequate
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
education that content those learning
 
02:01:59.830 --> 02:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
domains cannot be excluded from
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
instruction in order to be effective in
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
one you have to have the other you also
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
have to have other components of uh the
 
02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
other elements of a a
 
02:02:10.239 --> 02:02:10.870 align:start position:0%
other elements of a a
a

02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
quality education present and there's
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
some elements that we aren't going to be
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
discussing today like
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
the learning environment the the
 
02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
building itself or the leadership within
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
the building or the staff in the
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
building or the preconditions that
 
02:02:28.149 --> 02:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
students have when they come to school
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
in funding we have talked about that
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
another area those all relate to the
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate education but
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
what we got right now is the educational
 
02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:37.910 align:start position:0%
what we got right now is the educational
content

02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
content
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
what are those core subjects that core
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
knowledge that core skills which
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
students require to be successful and
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
meet the challenges of their careers
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
when they graduate from high school or
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
for post-secondary when they go on
 
02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:54.950 align:start position:0%
for post-secondary when they go on
beyond

02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
there are certain issues occurring in
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
schools now that are really restricting
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
that long list of core subject areas we
 
02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
have now in the learning domain areas
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education that restrict
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
it you know the learning time the school
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
time for an elementary child can be from
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere from five and a half hours to
 
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
five hours 45 minutes for a high school
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
student it could be as much as six hours
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
per day
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
but when you boil that down and take out
 
02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
all the time which is not direct
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
instruction you come down with possibly
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
30 minutes per day for lunch yes but
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
then above that break time above the
 
02:03:35.589 --> 02:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
recess time uh that's uh considered
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
transition times etc the actual times
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
for teaching made down come down to
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
about four and a half hours
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
but then you go into that and break that
 
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
down and how much of that is time on
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
task really engaged academic learning
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
time you can throw a piece of paper in
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
front of a worksheet and that's not
 
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be a learning
 
02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be a learning
opportunity

02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:03:59.589 --> 02:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
so what we have now is we have
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
restricted time in our schools for
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
teaching those core contents knowledge
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
and skills that absolutely every child
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
deserves and should have the opportunity
 
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
to receive
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
this is why this bill has been
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
introduced from my perspective
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the bill itself this
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
clarifies that
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
and defines adequacy as a rigorous
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
academic study in core knowledge and
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
learning domain areas that are
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
fundamental for academic success
 
02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
and those learning domains that are
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
listed in this bill are english language
 
02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:32.790 align:start position:0%
listed in this bill are english language
arts

02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
arts
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%

02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
those were the years ago the core
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
subjects that we had for when i went to
 
02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
subjects that we had for when i went to
school

02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
of course we had a few more back then
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
too penmanship spelling etc
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
some of us fared well on that on the
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
pink cards i see a lot of us could still
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
use a lot of learning
 
02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.669 align:start position:0%
use a lot of learning
um

02:05:03.669 --> 02:05:03.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
but through applied
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
through applied in stride the the
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
the importance of this bill is we also
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
take another component
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
and we address
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
areas where you can apply
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
this core knowledge and deepen and
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
deepen the integration and the learning
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
that goes on through world languages
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
logic and rhetoric that should be up in
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
integrated in everything we do
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
communication skills and thinking skills
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
we talk about thinking skills here
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
earlier this year
 
02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
with various bills which we've had
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%

02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%

physical education health and wellness
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
these are areas which are
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
where you can deepen learning but it
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
also this bill also
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
places in language and additional areas
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
of study may be determined by the local
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
school board so you go beyond this the
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
local school district can
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
identify other areas which they perceive
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
that might be unique to their particular
 
02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
school or their location or their
 
02:06:11.679 --> 02:06:13.750 align:start position:0%
school or their location or their
community

02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
there are a number of areas which we're
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
looking at in this bill that we
 
02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:19.189 align:start position:0%
looking at in this bill that we
are

02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
or i guess there was number areas within
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
hp 242 as you recall that are not looked
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
at in this bill the costing of an
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
adequate education was in 242. this bill
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
does not have anything to do with the
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
costing of an adequate education
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
you also remember that within 242 there
 
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
was a component which dealt with the
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program that's not
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this bill at all this bill
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
strictly deals with the definition of
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
adequacy the content of adequacy the
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
delivery of adequacy and the
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
accountability for that and
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that the department of
 
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
education has in terms of reporting back
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
to this legislature
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the every every
 
02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
five years the accountability system we
 
02:07:03.679 --> 02:07:04.629 align:start position:0%
five years the accountability system we
have

02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
and reporting back to the
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
legislature on that so i'm not going to
 
02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
go further into this bill right now i'm
 
02:07:13.589 --> 02:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
here to introduce it the commissioner of
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
education is here to take you through
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
some of the particulars and some of the
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
rationale why the department of
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
education is anxious to get this in
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
place and move forward in the state
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you any
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
questions for representative ladd uh
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative vlad looks like you did a
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
lot of work on this can you tell me was
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
there a committee composed of
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
teachers and
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh local school boards and
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
superintendents as well as
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
others who came up with
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
the different elements in this bill or
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
is there was there another way well
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
the elements you see are if they're
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
talking about the learning areas those
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
areas are basically they are in
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
um statute right now social studies is
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
not defined the way we've done it here
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
and put out the broken out the five
 
02:08:05.119 --> 02:08:06.149 align:start position:0%
and put out the broken out the five
areas

02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
areas
 
02:08:06.159 --> 02:08:06.830 align:start position:0%
areas
but

02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh the department has i've worked with
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
the department very closely
 
02:08:15.030 --> 02:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the time we did 242 and
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
following it so it's been an ongoing
 
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
process for the last several years i
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
know the department also you know takes
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
information from people within the
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
department uh whether i we've directly
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
involved people in the field i know i've
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
had discussions with people in the field
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
and they they feel right now a little
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
bit overwhelmed at times that they're
 
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
trying to cover all this within a very
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
shortened day and now they're dealing
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
with the results of covet and remote
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
learning and and having to do double
 
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
duty for those kids which once were in
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
kindergarten when this all started now
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
our third graders and just have missed a
 
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
whole lot
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
this area right here when we
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
specifically identify that knowledge and
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
skills required as the foundational
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
elements that make up and comprise an
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
adequate education and how they're
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
applied through these subjects in this
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
school which is part of it
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
um i think this will be more effective
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
and and certainly help our students
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
so in other words there was there was
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
not a group of teachers and um
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
principals and stuff that worked with
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
you on this this is i did not work for
 
02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
the task force if that's what you're
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
looking for thank you
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative walsh
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah this is real quick simply for those
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
of us that are newer to educational law
 
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
this is there's an awful lot here which
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you would acknowledge i'm
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if we can get a side by side
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
on these to look at the current law and
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
the changes in the law and in particular
 
02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:43.589 align:start position:0%
the changes in the law and in particular
where

02:09:43.589 --> 02:09:43.599 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
the change it not just in the technical
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
stuff about you know whether it includes
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
reading writing arithmetic but but i
 
02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
think there are some policy changes
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
embedded in here too and i'm wondering
 
02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
if we can get a side by side that pulls
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
out the language we can do that we can
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:09:58.950 --> 02:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is a result of when we
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
adopted essa essa the new every student
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
succeeds act
 
02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:05.599 align:start position:0%
and there were changes which came down
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
from the federal government we did chip
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
away at that and we made a whole lot of
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
changes within this area of statute
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
within 193e
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
the way those changes were made we
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
slipped it in the way it was written
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
not really to really support what we
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
need with essa and so
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
these changes right here reflect a lot
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
of that that we had done but things have
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
been arranged in a different uh uh
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
sequence so that's easier to understand
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
and read this bill than it was before
 
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
so i will yeah we can get this side by
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
side that's not not a problem to all
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative mullen
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelian thank
 
02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
you representative vlad for taking my
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
question my first question is
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
are you in a position to go piece by
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
piece through the bill or will there be
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
people following the commissioner will
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
do that okay thank you very much
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative tanner
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to follow up to i
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
believe it was representative porter's
 
02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:08.709 align:start position:0%
believe it was representative porter's
question

02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:11:08.719 --> 02:11:09.510 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
were there any any groups like the uh
 
02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
school boards association or the nea new
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh that were involved in the
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.550 --> 02:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
many of the issues which are in here
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
were in the previous statutory language
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
but there was no task force which
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
brought people together for example like
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
we did with the code ethics and the code
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
of conduct
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:42.069 --> 02:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
see no further questions uh thank you uh
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
chairman lad thank you
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
next i'll call on uh commissioner frank
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
edelblut of the department
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
um who did well in his penmanship on the
 
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone and for the record
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
frank edelblut commissioner of education
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you committee members for
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak with you about this
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
in my mind this bill represents an
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for
 
02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:23.350 align:start position:0%
opportunity for
us

02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
our school systems to refocus and
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
contribute to the correction of a
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
decades-long wrong
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
that has been so persistent relative to
 
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
student academic performance this really
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for new hampshire to
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
do something which it frequently does
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
which is be bold and move forward for
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
the sake of our students
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
now i want to give you some perspective
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of how i see some of the the
 
02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
changes that are being proposed here
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
play out
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
and really that is a perspective on
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
students and how students are performing
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the current k-12 education system
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
both here in new hampshire as well as
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
across the nation and i share this
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
information recognizing that new
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire holds the spot as one
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
depending on which survey you're looking
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
at one of the top performing states
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
relative to education across the country
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
now there are several assessments that
 
02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
are used to provide insight into student
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
academic trends
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
and these are trends that we can look at
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
both in the short run as well as over
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
the long term
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
there is the
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
national assessment of education
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
progress or nape the nation's report
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
card some of you may be familiar with
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
and it is a nationwide assessment in
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
math and reading to fourth and eighth
 
02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:40.470 align:start position:0%
math and reading to fourth and eighth
graders

02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
graders
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
and it provides a comparison among the
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
states in terms of how they're
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
performing we also have some an
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
assessment called the program for
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
international student assessment or pisa
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that is an international assessment
 
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
in math reading and science and it
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
provides comparisons among the oecd
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
countries and then there is the new
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire student assessment system or
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire sas and the s.a.t which
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
accompanies it in high school and this
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
is new hampshire a new hampshire based
 
02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
assessment in math reading and science
 
02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
for grades three through eight and in
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
high school
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
all of these assessment instruments tell
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
a similar story both here in new
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire as well as across the country
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
about our performing arts student
 
02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:24.629 align:start position:0%
about our performing arts student
performance

02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
performance
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
student performance has shown little
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
improvement over decades
 
02:14:31.669 --> 02:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
let that sink in for a moment student
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
performance has shown little improvement
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
over decades
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
the flat performance however masks
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
underlying and very important trends
 
02:14:43.109 --> 02:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
what we see in all of these assessment
 
02:14:43.119 --> 02:14:44.310 align:start position:0%
what we see in all of these assessment
instruments

02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
instruments
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
is that high performing students my top
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
quartile students show stable or modest
 
02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:51.030 align:start position:0%
quartile students show stable or modest
improvements

02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
improvements
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
while low performing students those in
 
02:14:55.030 --> 02:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
the lowest quartile are showing
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
declining performance
 
02:15:00.149 --> 02:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
essentially what you have happening here
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
is that and which is why we need to be
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
bold the system created with the
 
02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
aspiration of being the great equalizer
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
has in fact become the great divider and
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
i believe that this bill wants to move
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
in the direction of trying to correct
 
02:15:15.679 --> 02:15:17.030 align:start position:0%
in the direction of trying to correct
that

02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
some reflecting on some of this
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
performance observation take criticism
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
with the assessment instruments
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
themselves and i don't really want to
 
02:15:26.709 --> 02:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
engage today in a debate about
 
02:15:28.229 --> 02:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
assessment instruments but i'm happy to
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
do that if somebody wants to at some
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
future time
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
but you have to understand and this is
 
02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why i give you all
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
three of these assessments so these are
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
three different distinct assessment
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
tools that are used in different
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
contexts and different populations and
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
they're all telling the same story
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
when you consider the new hampshire
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
assessment the new hampshire sas
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
consider that it is an assessment of new
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire academic standards these are
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
the academic standards which our
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
education system has said this is what
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
we want our students to know to be able
 
02:16:02.069 --> 02:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
to be successful citizens
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
our education system is responsible for
 
02:16:06.069 --> 02:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
the instruction of students relative to
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
those standards
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire sas assessment
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
questions are questions that are
 
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
selected by our educators in terms of
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
what tests what questions we should give
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
and then we set the cut score
 
02:16:20.470 --> 02:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
through our education system to turn to
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
determine what level of attainment
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
should be a passing score
 
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
in effect our education
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
system tells us what students should
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
know to become successful citizens they
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
instruct students in those things and
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
they develop the assessment to see how
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
well the students understood the
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
instruction at the end of that process
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
whether we use nape whether we use pisa
 
02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
whether we use the new hampshire sas
 
02:16:46.629 --> 02:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
we generally get less than 50 percent of
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
our students to proficiency and yet we
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
end up graduating 90 of our students out
 
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
of high school
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
reflecting on student performance
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's an author of a book school
 
02:16:59.910 --> 02:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
houses state houses and courthouses eric
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
hanashek from stanford university he
 
02:17:05.349 --> 02:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
states the country seems to be stuck in
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
a rut and achievement levels have
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
remained largely stagnant since the
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
1960s despite massive efforts to improve
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
them this is why we need to be bold and
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
let me reflect on what some of those
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
efforts are
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
in 1964 we had the equality of
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity act or the
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
coleman report and that was nine years
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
after we had brown v board of education
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
and the question that they were asking
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
in 1964
 
02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
in 1964
is

02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
why after 10 years close to 10 years
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
with brown v board of education has the
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
black white equity gap persisted why
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
does it still exist in 1964 at a federal
 
02:17:49.589 --> 02:17:49.599 align:start position:0%
level we were asking that question
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
in 1965 president johnson's war on
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
poverty included for the first time the
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
federal government weighing in on
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
education through the elementary and
 
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
secondary education act
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
which provided significant federal
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
funding to education with the premise
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
that more funding would improve
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
education and that improved education
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
would eliminate poverty almost 60 years
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
later that goal has not been realized
 
02:18:19.669 --> 02:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
in 1983 under president reagan we got a
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
nation at risk
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
looking at education
 
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
there's a statement that is relatively
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh well known relative to that work that
 
02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
was done by president reagan that says
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
if an unfriendly foreign power had
 
02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
attempted to impose on america the
 
02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
mediocre education performance that
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
exists today we might have viewed it as
 
02:18:41.429 --> 02:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
an act of war
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
in 1989 see a pattern developing we got
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
the national education summit by
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
president george h.w bush which
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
established education goals to be
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
achieved by 2000
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
including all u.s students achieving
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
competency and challenging subject
 
02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
matters including among others english
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
math and science
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
in 2001
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go on forever in 2001 we got
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
the no child left behind act by
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
president george bush which required
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
rigorous state economic standards that
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
must be met by 2014.
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
in 2015 we got the every student
 
02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
succeeds act by president obama which
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
aspires that all students in america be
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
taught to high academic standards that
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
will prepare them to succeed in college
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
and careers
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
what is clear
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
is that a herculean effort has been put
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
forth to try to move education forward
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
and close the disparity gaps
 
02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
but the evidence is clear as well these
 
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
efforts have not been successful
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
to those who might argue that somehow
 
02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
funding or lack thereof is the driver i
 
02:19:50.309 --> 02:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
can provide hours of evidence of massive
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
increases in funding well beyond
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
inflation that have not been effective
 
02:19:56.469 --> 02:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
again eric haneshan quoting from
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
stanford the additional resources have
 
02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
not significantly altered the patterns
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
of low student achievement observed over
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
the last several decades
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
now to the bill let me describe to you
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
the dilemma that we are facing in
 
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:12.630 align:start position:0%
the dilemma that we are facing in
education

02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:20:15.990 --> 02:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
we have a fixed instructional day
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's 180 or instructional year we have
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
180 days in a year or the equivalent
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
number of hours 9.90 for high school 9
 
02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:25.190 align:start position:0%
number of hours 9.90 for high school 9
45

02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
45
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
you know in the
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
elementary school
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
and the school days generally run from 7
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
30 a.m to 2 30 p.m and into this fixed
 
02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
amount of time all of the required areas
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
of study must be compressed
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
the day does not extend
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
and when we add something we take away
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
from something else
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
the result which seems to be reflected
 
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
in the assessment results
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
is that we do many things but poorly but
 
02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
few things with excellence right is
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
there an opportunity to focus our
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
efforts and be bold in that area
 
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the list of learning areas in
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
193 e2a that are listed in your bill
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
i think we would all agree that
 
02:21:09.439 --> 02:21:10.950 align:start position:0%
i think we would all agree that
everything

02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
there is valuable and important first
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
information for students to learn but
 
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there that i'm like
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
oh i don't want kids to know that we
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
agree that it's all important
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
what i would question is whether all
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
such areas are essential for students to
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
become effective and productive citizens
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is allow our
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
education system to focus its attention
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
on the important foundational areas that
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
really are essential to the future
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
success of our students as citizens in
 
02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
let's consider some examples of what
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
this bill excludes through in out of
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
those core areas world languages
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'm a big proponent of world languages i
 
02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
personally have competency in several of
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
them i also know however that most
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
citizens in new hampshire and likely
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
most of you in this room
 
02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
are functioning with only one language
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
english at this point in time
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
and so is that essential for our
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
students if we're trying to figure out
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
how they can be successful citizens
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
another area that we have on the list is
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
computer programming another subject i'm
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
very fond of and possess a degree of
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
competency in but what i also know
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
is that about computer programming is
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
that if you have not attained basic
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
algebraic thinking programming will be
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult for you
 
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
and so what this really does is it
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity for integration
 
02:22:39.910 --> 02:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
with such a growing list of subjects
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to cram into this
 
02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:42.469 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to cram into this
fixed

02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
you know bucket that we have
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
subjects tend to become isolated in
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
their own domain and instruction is not
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
well integrated there are some attempts
 
02:22:53.910 --> 02:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
these days to try and integrate that but
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
we need more of that integration perhaps
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
if we were to focus our attention
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
we would help that integration move
 
02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
forward so that
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
instruction uh you know so that to would
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
integrate um hey let me see i lost my
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
page here uh i have math teachers
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
computer teachers and art teachers
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps if we were to focus our
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
attention we would integrate instruction
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
and get better algebraic thinking and
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
better computer programming perhaps if
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
we were to focus our attention we would
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
integrate instruction and would get
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
better geometry and better art
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
instruction why are those two not
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
together i mean if you imagine we've all
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
seen some of those analogies in terms of
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
time management where you have a bucket
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
you're trying to fill it with some big
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
objects some large objects and then some
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
small objects maybe it's water or sand
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
or something like that
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
and what everybody will tell you is you
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
put the large objects in first and then
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
you let the other ones fill in around it
 
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
and you get more capacity out of that
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
container that's what we're talking
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
about here
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
now let's consider what the bill
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
includes as essential to helping
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
students grow to become effective and
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
productive citizens
 
02:23:59.910 --> 02:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
the list focuses on core academic areas
 
02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
that have stood the test of time in
 
02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:03.110 align:start position:0%
that have stood the test of time in
education

02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
the list includes those areas that are
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
the focus of required assessments
 
02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
against swiss the system efficacy is
 
02:24:13.349 --> 02:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
being measured math english and science
 
02:24:15.429 --> 02:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
the list includes areas of social
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
studies which along with other areas is
 
02:24:21.429 --> 02:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
viewed as essential to being a
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
a successful and productive citizen and
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
i hear again and again from my social
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
studies teachers how it's been pushed
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
out you know we didn't have room so when
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
we added another thing into the list
 
02:24:34.630 --> 02:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that oftentimes
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
falls off the table
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
the list includes foundational areas
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
that students can build from as they
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
pursue their own areas of interest
 
02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
equipping them to be lifelong learners
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
if we don't teach them
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
literacy if we don't bring their
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
literacy to a high level if we don't
 
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
teach them numeracy and bring their math
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
capacity to a higher level that they
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't have those skills to apply in all
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
kinds of domains because those are core
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
skills that apply across all different
 
02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:04.230 align:start position:0%
skills that apply across all different
domains

02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
domains
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
so how does this bill allow the
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislature to continue to weigh in on
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
areas of study that they see as
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
important they'll perhaps not require
 
02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i think the bill continues to
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of broad and
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
integrated educational options through
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
the applied instruction i understand
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
that the bill like this may be viewed by
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
some as being limiting in fact it should
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
be viewed as liberating
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
and an opportunity to be more engaging
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
for our students
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
we need to have collaboration between
 
02:25:35.429 --> 02:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
math teachers and art teachers we need
 
02:25:37.349 --> 02:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
collaboration between math teachers and
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
robotics teachers we need collaboration
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
between these different domains
 
02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
applied knowledge grabs the interests of
 
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
students and makes it so they cannot
 
02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
avoid but learn
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
i hope that you will consider the
 
02:25:52.389 --> 02:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
importance of this bill
 
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that we will be bold here in new
 
02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:55.110 align:start position:0%
and that we will be bold here in new
hampshire

02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
in its context and considering this bill
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the context of decades of attempts at
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
failed change not just here in new
 
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire but you heard that list of all
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
these national efforts every decade
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
another initiative starts because we
 
02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
recognize that it hasn't moved forward
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
since brown v board of education ten
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
years after that we looked at it we
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
didn't get that done
 
02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know in its context of helping
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
schools focus efforts on areas that we
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
have consistently not been successful at
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
for too many students you know not here
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but a tragic story that
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
some of you may have seen of a high
 
02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
school in baltimore
 
02:26:31.359 --> 02:26:32.790 align:start position:0%
school in baltimore
where

02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
71 percent of the students in high
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
school were reading at an elementary
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
grade level of kindergarten first grader
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
second grade
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that we don't have that here
 
02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
in its context of helping to drive
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
innovative and applied instruction that
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
grabs the attention and curiosity of our
 
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
students so that we can move forward so
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me share with you
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
today and i'm happy to answer any
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner do we have
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
questions for the commissioner
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
very much um
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner for uh for joining us uh
 
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
this morning and this afternoon um
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
so at the uh at the top of your
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
testimony you mentioned how um how
 
02:27:19.990 --> 02:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
overall new hampshire's public education
 
02:27:21.990 --> 02:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
does uh does very well certainly on uh
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
on a national basis on a national
 
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
ranking so
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
well hang on hang on
 
02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sort of getting to my question
 
02:27:29.439 --> 02:27:30.550 align:start position:0%
i'm sort of getting to my question
um

02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
and um and you mentioned that
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
that that that a lot of students are
 
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
really i don't think you use the word
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
left behind but but basically that there
 
02:27:40.150 --> 02:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
are gaps
 
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
and um uh and that uh and that this um
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
these outcomes are just not not
 
02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
happening everywhere so i guess the
 
02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
question to you is that if um if if
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
those gaps
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
those um opportunity gaps are as a
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
result of
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
of how
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
an adequate public education is defined
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
in 193 e2a
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
and the accountability sections that
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
you've that you
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
that you have in here
 
02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:10.630 align:start position:0%
that you have in here
then

02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
then has new hampshire
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
been providing an adequate
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for an adequate education
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
for all of its kids so i would say that
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is providing more than an
 
02:28:23.110 --> 02:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
adequate opportunity for an education
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
but i think that by focusing it we can
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
tone in on what is core to having
 
02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:30.550 align:start position:0%
tone in on what is core to having
success

02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
success
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
for our education system and so what i
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
would point out to you is while new
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire is one of the higher
 
02:28:36.479 --> 02:28:38.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire is one of the higher
performing

02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
performing
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know academic or educational systems
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
among the new the 50 states if you look
 
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
at pisa which is the international
 
02:28:47.590 --> 02:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
assessment you'll find that we rank in
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
the 30s behind many of our oecd customer
 
02:28:53.429 --> 02:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
countries around the world and that has
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
not improved over time and what we've
 
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
seen is a falling on that international
 
02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
ranking so typically you know if you're
 
02:29:02.950 --> 02:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
competing in an in a business and you
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
see yourself falling behind
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
the important thing to do is figure out
 
02:29:08.710 --> 02:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
what is my core mission and how do i
 
02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
refocus on that core mission so that's
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
really what we're talking about what is
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
that adequate education we want to hone
 
02:29:16.469 --> 02:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
in on and make sure that we're focused
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
on so that we can do a better job on
 
02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:19.910 align:start position:0%
on so that we can do a better job on
that

02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
so in a quick follow-up mr chief yes so
 
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
um so i think this will be um uh easier
 
02:29:26.790 --> 02:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
to look at once uh chairman chair ladd
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
has uh has completed the the side by
 
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
side with with existing law
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
and um and i um i appreciate very much
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
your um your your separating the um the
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
sort of the fundamental um core
 
02:29:46.469 --> 02:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
knowledge for academic success and then
 
02:29:49.270 --> 02:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
areas that can really help stimulate and
 
02:29:52.309 --> 02:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
drive that you know and leverage that
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
core knowledge but i'm struggling to
 
02:29:57.030 --> 02:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
really understand
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
how how
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
changing this
 
02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
um is
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
is somehow going to uh
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
close those these opportunity gaps that
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
we see across the state which are very
 
02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
heavily tied
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
with um uh in communities that that are
 
02:30:17.710 --> 02:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
that that tend to skew to lower
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic conditions and higher
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
economic challenges and lower resource
 
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
capacity than than other districts and
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to see how
 
02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:31.110 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to see how
how

02:30:31.110 --> 02:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
how this plan
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh really does change the slope of uh of
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
that opportunity for um uh for all of
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
the uh uh you know kids that are that
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
are not able to uh to perform at the
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
same level as so many others yeah so i
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question and i think
 
02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's a german question
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
right imagine we're talking about 60
 
02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
years or more
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
of this equity disparity that you've
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
talked about this system that's supposed
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
to be the great equalizer has in fact
 
02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
become the great divider
 
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
and rather than close some of these
 
02:31:06.870 --> 02:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
disparity gaps over these 60 years we've
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
not they're getting wider and not not
 
02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
narrower and so what i would tell you is
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
um even you know in our own you know
 
02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
everyone everyone here in their own
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
lives uh when you need to get
 
02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
when you've got lots going on but you
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
have something you need to get done you
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
focus on the core and so that's what i'm
 
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is i think that this
 
02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:27.349 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is i think that this
bill

02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:31:27.359 --> 02:31:28.389 align:start position:0%
bill
allows

02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
allows
 
02:31:30.389 --> 02:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
the legislature to signal to the school
 
02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
system look let's get back to job number
 
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
one which is building a foundation of
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
education so these students can come out
 
02:31:39.349 --> 02:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
of our school system
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
with these important foundational skills
 
02:31:44.309 --> 02:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
to be successful citizens
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
and that's really i think what the focus
 
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
is so
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
do i know that this will close that
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
equity gap i don't know the answer to
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
that representative if i knew the answer
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
to that then we wouldn't have 60 years
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
of uh you know of not closing that gap
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
with with lots and lots of efforts gone
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
into that but what i do know is
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
that a move like this is going to be a
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
bold move
 
02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's really not so radical in the
 
02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
sense of what we're saying is like let's
 
02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
focus our attention let's get down to
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
what it is that these kids really need
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to have
 
02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i think we can all agree that these
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
are important skills for them to have
 
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
and by doing that
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
are we
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
signaling to our school system are we
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
equipping and enabling our school system
 
02:32:28.469 --> 02:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
to be able to focus and not feel like
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
they have to do everything at a frantic
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
pace potentially poorly
 
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
represented tanner
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair and thank you for taking the
 
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
question and and welcome to the
 
02:32:41.349 --> 02:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
committee thank you um i wanted to just
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
go back to the process question that i
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
asked representative ladd um i'm
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
wondering why or if he was
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think he was correct and saying that
 
02:32:52.990 --> 02:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
there was no task force there was no
 
02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:54.710 align:start position:0%
there was no task force there was no
collaboration

02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
02:32:54.720 --> 02:32:55.750 align:start position:0%
collaboration
between

02:32:55.750 --> 02:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:32:59.110 --> 02:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know our fine unh education
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
department and
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
the fine instructors and educational
 
02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
specialists we have
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
all over new hampshire
 
02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
to come together to to
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
develop some of this and and to refine
 
02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
it as well as like the school boards
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
association some of the other uh
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
associations yeah so in fact what i
 
02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
would describe for you is at the
 
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
department we have the opportunity to
 
02:33:23.429 --> 02:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
work with all of those groups on a
 
02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
number of different projects we are
 
02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
working through the comprehensive center
 
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
on innovation in schools and how we can
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
apply it we've got another project with
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
the rel looking at the data around the
 
02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:35.030 align:start position:0%
the rel looking at the data around the
performance

02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
performance
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
that is comprised with department staff
 
02:33:39.830 --> 02:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
as well as school staff uh we've got
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
pride i hope task force right now that's
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the entire 306 rules around
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
education what are the
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards for education
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's comprised of a number of
 
02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:50.550 align:start position:0%
that's comprised of a number of
superintendents

02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
superintendents
 
02:33:52.630 --> 02:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's got you know i think principals and
 
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
other representatives in there so
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
through that process
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
we are getting input from the system
 
02:34:01.270 --> 02:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
across the board and what this really
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
represents in my mind is kind of a
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
culmination of how does this stuff all
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
come together because you begin to hear
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
themes consistent across these various
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
task forces that you know schools are
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
trying to fit more into a fixed amount
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
of time and can we actually do that or
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
is are we better served by focusing our
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
attention on stuff that we think is
 
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
really essential
 
02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up thank you um and that's
 
02:34:27.830 --> 02:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
great i i'm glad that that that's
 
02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
happening but i'm wondering why the
 
02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:30.710 align:start position:0%
happening but i'm wondering why the
stakeholders

02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
and the expertise within the state not
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
just at the focused at the state
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
were the people that took all this
 
02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:40.150 align:start position:0%
were the people that took all this
information

02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
and focused it
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
into something that's applicable to our
 
02:34:47.110 --> 02:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
every day
 
02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:48.950 align:start position:0%
every day
educational

02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
educational
 
02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
system that we're we support through
 
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
public education in new hampshire so so
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
let me just be clear so in fact that's
 
02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is that we got the input
 
02:34:59.270 --> 02:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
from all these various task forces and
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
you could see the common themes running
 
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
through them and be able to work with it
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
and probably the department better than
 
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else's position to be able to do
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
that because you know you have
 
02:35:12.309 --> 02:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
superintendents and principals some work
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
on this task force another on this test
 
02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
for us another on this task force
 
02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
another on this task force so but what
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have the advantage of and i
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
think really what this bill does this is
 
02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
a step back perspective type of a bill
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
right and so we have the ability to look
 
02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
across all of these task forces where
 
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
quite frankly i'm not sure that the
 
02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
that superintendents and principals
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the capacity among
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
their other job that they're doing to be
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
able to have the broader perspective but
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
because all of these various efforts
 
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
roll up to the department of education
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
it provides us with i think better
 
02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:46.950 align:start position:0%
it provides us with i think better
perspective

02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:35:49.030 --> 02:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner welcome
 
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
um your
 
02:35:55.349 --> 02:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
talk this morning brought me back to my
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
graduate student days in educational
 
02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:58.630 align:start position:0%
graduate student days in educational
leadership

02:35:58.630 --> 02:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
and um something that i learned during
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
that process was that
 
02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
reaching consensus on something is
 
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
major change of this
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
is this it's not always as simple as it
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
might sound
 
02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:12.389 align:start position:0%
might sound
and

02:36:12.389 --> 02:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that you would hope you
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
would have buy-in from
 
02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:22.309 --> 02:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
legislature as well as a large
 
02:36:24.469 --> 02:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
percentage of the population of the
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
state on what you're trying to do here
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
when i look at the sponsors of this bill
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
i see
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
they all belong to one party
 
02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
so how would you
 
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
work to convince people that might not
 
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
be listed on here that what you're
 
02:36:41.590 --> 02:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
trying to do is really
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
to the benefit of everyone else
 
02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
so thanks for that question because i
 
02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
the sponsorship of that is uh you know
 
02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
another matter altogether but what i
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
would tell you is if we look at i hope
 
02:36:56.389 --> 02:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
that it was a little bit
 
02:36:58.309 --> 02:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
revealing to you and maybe even a little
 
02:37:00.150 --> 02:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
bit shocking when you look at the
 
02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
history of some of these national
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
efforts right 1964. 1964 1965 1980 1989
 
02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
2000 2015 like we just keep doing it
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
right like it's time for us to be bold
 
02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
and do something and so
 
02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
my hope is that as i'm sharing my
 
02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
testimony you too will agree
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
that this is a bold step but it's not a
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
radical step like we're not you know
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
there we still have all these core
 
02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
things in there we're still teaching we
 
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
want to focus um so what we're really
 
02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do is just
 
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
cause some focus that will happen and
 
02:37:35.670 --> 02:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
then you know ultimately whether this
 
02:37:37.110 --> 02:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
passes or not is up to you as a
 
02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:38.950 align:start position:0%
passes or not is up to you as a
legislature

02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:41.030 align:start position:0%
legislature
follow-up

02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
i do understand that um because i know
 
02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the things that you're
 
02:37:46.230 --> 02:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
talking about have been being talked
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
about for a long time and indeed have
 
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
been being tried
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking about specifically very
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
narrow but having to do the amount of
 
02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
time and day and how everything is
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
crammed in a number of years ago
 
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
our school district
 
02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
was looking at
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
changing the starting times
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
for the elementary school and high
 
02:38:09.750 --> 02:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
school because young children learn
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
better in the morning early morning and
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
high school kids learn better later on
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
in the day
 
02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
and it made a lot of sense there was
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
research behind it but we couldn't
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
convince the community that that was
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
what they wanted what they wanted to do
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm just concerned i know there's
 
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
been a lot of legislation that's been
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
moved through this this legislature this
 
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
year that does not have an awful lot of
 
02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh community support behind it and um
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned that this is another
 
02:38:39.990 --> 02:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
one of these efforts that
 
02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to be defending when i
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
go out in my community so i i think when
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
you go out to your community if you're
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
defending to parents that we're going to
 
02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
get your kids to proficiency and english
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
in math
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
in social studies and in science
 
02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know then i think they're going to
 
02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
be very excited about that and you're
 
02:39:01.750 --> 02:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
not taking anything away because you can
 
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
still use these applied learning areas
 
02:39:05.910 --> 02:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
and in fact what we'll do is to make
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
them more engaging for the students you
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
know this better than i do right so make
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
it more engaging for those students to
 
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
be learning so we're really it's not a
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is not a zero-sum game where uh you
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
know you have to you're eliminating
 
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
something what you're doing is you're
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
pushing together and focusing the effort
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman cordelli and thank
 
02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
you commissioner for being here and for
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to just point out that as a
 
02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
new member of education this year these
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
are the types of conversations that i
 
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
love to have these are the this is the
 
02:39:44.309 --> 02:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
reason that i wanted to be on education
 
02:39:47.429 --> 02:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
to focus on educational content
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
um and rep porter i wish you were a
 
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
quite often we forget that education
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
could be the equalizer
 
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
many students come to school
 
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
hoping to either change their situation
 
02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:07.190 align:start position:0%
hoping to either change their situation
or

02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
improve their situation
 
02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
from where they came and i was one of
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
those students
 
02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i i appreciate this i appreciate the
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
aspect of lifelong learning and i have a
 
02:40:21.190 --> 02:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
question and then a would you believe my
 
02:40:23.910 --> 02:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
question is could you explain what the
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
acronym oecd means because i've never
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
heard that before uh organization
 
02:40:32.710 --> 02:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
country development i don't remember but
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's basically that's okay good question
 
02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:39.110 align:start position:0%
it's basically that's okay good question
uh

02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:40.469 align:start position:0%
uh
yeah

02:40:40.469 --> 02:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:40:42.550 --> 02:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
we see i mean but basically it is like
 
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
the economically developed countries
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
across the world so i'll do my research
 
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
and i have a lot of people
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
google oecd for me
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
follow up would you believe um in
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
concord mass there is a museum the
 
02:40:59.190 --> 02:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
concord museum that has and it's been a
 
02:41:00.630 --> 02:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
while since i've been there so i'm going
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
from memory a
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's a some sort of a document from
 
02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:05.670 align:start position:0%
it's a some sort of a document from
either

02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
ralph waldo emerson or bronson alcott
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
that talks about how adequate
 
02:41:13.750 --> 02:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
inadequately education is funded from
 
02:41:16.950 --> 02:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
1888 so it's a long time
 
02:41:18.309 --> 02:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:21.910 align:start position:0%
uh representative
mullen

02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
mullen
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli uh
 
02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner for taking my
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions i have just uh
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
some technical questions here so um
 
02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
on page one of the bill in roman two
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
where it lists out world languages logic
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
personal finance you know what i'm
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
referencing it says that these areas
 
02:41:47.429 --> 02:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
shall be integrated into a student's
 
02:41:47.439 --> 02:41:48.870 align:start position:0%
shall be integrated into a student's
learning

02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
learning
 
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
am i reading correctly but that will be
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
determined to what degree by the local
 
02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
school district
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's what i would understand in other
 
02:41:59.110 --> 02:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
words we're basically signaling to them
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
that we think these are important areas
 
02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
and you can continue to offer them as a
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
separate thing if that's what you want
 
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
to do but otherwise we think that you
 
02:42:09.190 --> 02:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
should look for opportunities to
 
02:42:11.349 --> 02:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
integrate and because you're focusing we
 
02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
think that that sets up the system that
 
02:42:15.190 --> 02:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
encourages that type of integration so
 
02:42:18.550 --> 02:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
that would follow up that would move uh
 
02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:20.630 align:start position:0%
that would follow up that would move uh
these

02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
content areas away from
 
02:42:27.030 --> 02:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
x number of minutes per week and
 
02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:27.830 align:start position:0%
x number of minutes per week and
uh

02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
at least k through 12.
 
02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:30.950 align:start position:0%
at least k through 12.
um

02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
one more okay one more the next section
 
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
instruction in core domains and learning
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
shall be complemented with integrated
 
02:42:42.550 --> 02:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
instruction for the development of
 
02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:44.309 align:start position:0%
instruction for the development of
aptitudes

02:42:44.309 --> 02:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
aptitudes
 
02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
i mean right away i'm wondering what is
 
02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
actually being said here uh including
 
02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
effective communication analytic
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
research benevolence public and private
 
02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:55.910 align:start position:0%
research benevolence public and private
charity

02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
charity
 
02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
industry and economy honesty and
 
02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
punctuality sincere sincerity and
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
self-control my question is
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
who picked the attributes how were these
 
02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
decided upon how are they going to be
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
instructed and how are they ever going
 
02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
to be measured
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
well so certainly you recognize the list
 
02:43:17.429 --> 02:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
of most of those from article 83 of the
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution right so in
 
02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
article 83 we basically say these are
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
things that we want our students
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
inculcated with
 
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
the vernacular may be dated
 
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that there's per se
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
magic to this but what we're recognizing
 
02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
is that beyond those core subjects these
 
02:43:37.830 --> 02:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
types of attributes and character traits
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
are important to the success of the
 
02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:41.590 align:start position:0%
are important to the success of the
students

02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative ford did you have a
 
02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:46.230 align:start position:0%
representative ford did you have a
question

02:43:46.230 --> 02:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.830 --> 02:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh for taking my question thank you sir
 
02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
for answering or attempting to answer
 
02:43:54.150 --> 02:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
this what i'm going to pose
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
i wonder if we conducted an experiment
 
02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:58.150 align:start position:0%
i wonder if we conducted an experiment
here

02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:44:00.150 --> 02:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
and asked everyone who had studied a
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
foreign language in college to raise
 
02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
their hand
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
and then ask shall we continue this
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
meeting in that language
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
how many hands would still be set up
 
02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
would we ask that question
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to answer that question
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
because i can tell you i did not study
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:28.399 --> 02:44:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
because you learn how to learn and you
 
02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
can learn things the follow-up question
 
02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:33.590 align:start position:0%
can learn things the follow-up question
is

02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:44:36.150 --> 02:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
if we teach a language in a college as
 
02:44:38.150 --> 02:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
we do in many cases
 
02:44:40.710 --> 02:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
and then we never require them to use
 
02:44:44.309 --> 02:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
that language in any other course
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
how long are they likely to continue to
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
command that language
 
02:44:51.269 --> 02:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
not very long i suspect do it and i do
 
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
want to i'll comment a little bit on the
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
language because i do love foreign
 
02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
languages and so i do i understand what
 
02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying in terms of
 
02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:45:00.630 --> 02:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
years of study go in and many people
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
don't have any uh utility for that um
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
in i don't disagree with the premise but
 
02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that not being able to
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
use it
 
02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:12.230 align:start position:0%
use it
obviates

02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
obviates
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
all of the benefit of studying it
 
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
because when you learn another language
 
02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
you're firing off different neurons in
 
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
your brain which are going to be
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
beneficial you have those other pathways
 
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
when you're learning another language
 
02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
you're understanding another grammar um
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
and as the famous historian uh you know
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh lukakus said you know saying
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
something in a different language isn't
 
02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
just saying the same thing with
 
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
different you know sounds it's actually
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
saying something slightly different um
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know so there's nuance to it as well
 
02:45:42.550 --> 02:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i hope that helps follow one more
 
02:45:44.469 --> 02:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
would that also apply to mathematics
 
02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
though in the same way i mean we take
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
courses in mathematics and then we're
 
02:45:51.590 --> 02:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
never in another course asked to apply
 
02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
that mathematics toward that
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
subject yeah so sometimes you're asked
 
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
to apply it and sometimes you're not but
 
02:45:59.110 --> 02:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
what i would tell you is when you learn
 
02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
how to solve a quadratic equation you
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
learn how to
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
um think logically you know how to build
 
02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
multi-variable uh you know thought
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
processes and that helps you whether
 
02:46:12.469 --> 02:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with mathematics computer
 
02:46:14.630 --> 02:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
programming a complex you know
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
literature piece of literature that has
 
02:46:19.590 --> 02:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
a very uh you know complex storyline or
 
02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:21.429 align:start position:0%
a very uh you know complex storyline or
plot

02:46:21.429 --> 02:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
plot
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
and i wonder why so many of our teachers
 
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
take neither of those courses
 
02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cornell thank
 
02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:29.269 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cornell thank
you

02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
question i'm coming from manchester
 
02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
which is very very underfunded and
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
one of the under-resourced schools
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
it would be hard
 
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
how will this work for them and will
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
there be any targeted aid to help
 
02:46:44.399 --> 02:46:46.469 align:start position:0%
there be any targeted aid to help
manchester

02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
offer some of these things
 
02:46:50.469 --> 02:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
so these things are already required so
 
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
really what we're doing is we're
 
02:46:53.590 --> 02:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
allowing the district to focus their
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
resources so it's not nothing is being
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
asked in addition this is already part
 
02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education what you're
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
really doing is you're saying this is a
 
02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
focus this is the point that's that will
 
02:47:06.630 --> 02:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
help to
 
02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
to allow that to be focused and if i
 
02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
might share a story about manchester um
 
02:47:12.309 --> 02:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
so manchester has a computer science
 
02:47:12.319 --> 02:47:13.670 align:start position:0%
so manchester has a computer science
class

02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
class
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
right now it is the most failed class in
 
02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
not because it's so difficult but
 
02:47:22.230 --> 02:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
because it's so boring
 
02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
um that kids just check out um so we're
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
working with manchester right now to
 
02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
develop through learn everywhere a
 
02:47:30.870 --> 02:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
program with esports to learn computer
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
programming through esports so then you
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
know which is a much more engaging thing
 
02:47:36.070 --> 02:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the you see it's just one more
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
extension of applying knowledge in a
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
domain so that you can engage the
 
02:47:42.309 --> 02:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
students as best you can so we are happy
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
to work with manchester uh to try and
 
02:47:47.110 --> 02:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
help them understand how to do this
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
focus but i think that this is a
 
02:47:51.429 --> 02:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
reprieve for many of our school leaders
 
02:47:53.349 --> 02:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
who can say okay i get this this is
 
02:47:55.349 --> 02:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
where i can now focus and get done the
 
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
job at task because remember
 
02:47:59.910 --> 02:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
every year you know nape releases
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
results fees are released releases
 
02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
results every couple of years right they
 
02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't do that every year or nape is
 
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
every other year and we have the new
 
02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire sas and we all look at these
 
02:48:08.630 --> 02:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
results by which we're measuring the
 
02:48:10.389 --> 02:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
efficacy of our system and we see like
 
02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
oh they didn't get the job done you know
 
02:48:13.510 --> 02:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
because they got 50 of the kids to
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
proficiency don't we want to see that
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
improve and again i think that's what
 
02:48:19.110 --> 02:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
not only do we want to see that improve
 
02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:20.150 align:start position:0%
not only do we want to see that improve
but

02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know starting back you know with
 
02:48:23.269 --> 02:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
brown v board of education we wanted
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
that improved and we're still working on
 
02:48:25.359 --> 02:48:26.389 align:start position:0%
that improved and we're still working on
that

02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:48:29.349 --> 02:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem right representative porter
 
02:48:31.349 --> 02:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
this is just a quick question thank you
 
02:48:32.790 --> 02:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
again uh
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner so if i'm understanding
 
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
right and i
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
might not be understanding correctly
 
02:48:42.309 --> 02:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the list of things that are
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
on page 2 under roman 2 those a through
 
02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:47.030 align:start position:0%
on page 2 under roman 2 those a through
g

02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
g
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
if a school district was trying to save
 
02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:51.030 align:start position:0%
if a school district was trying to save
money

02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes
 
02:48:56.550 --> 02:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
would they be able to eliminate their
 
02:48:58.630 --> 02:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
world languages program
 
02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
and get rid of those teachers
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
would they be able to get rid of their
 
02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
um arts education program etc because
 
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's no longer part of the requirement
 
02:49:09.910 --> 02:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
from the state yeah so they would still
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
be required to offer that type of
 
02:49:13.830 --> 02:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
instruction it may be that and even they
 
02:49:15.429 --> 02:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
can do this today they can offer that
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
through vlax or some other means
 
02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
the objective would be to see more of
 
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
the integration take place so you would
 
02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:23.269 align:start position:0%
the integration take place so you would
see

02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
schools instead of isolating art like i
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
mean it drives me not sometimes why is
 
02:49:29.910 --> 02:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
art and math not
 
02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
integrated right like this is you know
 
02:49:34.150 --> 02:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
like uh you know if you're learning
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
about vanishing points you're learning
 
02:49:37.830 --> 02:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
some geometry there and uh you know so
 
02:49:39.590 --> 02:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
so what we need to see happen is we need
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
to enable the schools to stay focused
 
02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
and then pull these other disciplines in
 
02:49:47.510 --> 02:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of how to engage the students
 
02:49:50.070 --> 02:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
follow up so as opposed to isolating is
 
02:49:51.510 --> 02:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
that clear what i'm saying no it's not
 
02:49:52.630 --> 02:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:53.510 align:start position:0%
um okay
if

02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:49:57.190 --> 02:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
if i'm got english language arts and i
 
02:49:59.269 --> 02:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
how am i going to pull french
 
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
into english language arts arithmetic
 
02:50:04.230 --> 02:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
and mathematics natural physical science
 
02:50:05.670 --> 02:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
or social studies
 
02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
so how am i going to get them so that
 
02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
they can be proficient in speaking
 
02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:09.990 align:start position:0%
they can be proficient in speaking
french

02:50:09.990 --> 02:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
french
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
if i don't have
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
french classes that are focusing on
 
02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
grammar and vocabulary but instead
 
02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
they're being integrated into the
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
literature program so so they're able to
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
offer a french class but i would say
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
that you would integrate that with
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
humanities and it might be with world
 
02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
history where you would introduce those
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
students to learning and they're
 
02:50:32.790 --> 02:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
studying the french revolution and the
 
02:50:34.389 --> 02:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
french teachers in there explaining some
 
02:50:35.670 --> 02:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
of the stuff and describing some of that
 
02:50:37.349 --> 02:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
language and the kid goes wow i would
 
02:50:38.950 --> 02:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
love to learn french it would be awesome
 
02:50:41.750 --> 02:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
right or it could be that you do uh in a
 
02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
u.s history and you're studying
 
02:50:45.830 --> 02:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
louisiana and louisiana purchase and the
 
02:50:48.230 --> 02:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
french influence down there and how that
 
02:50:50.230 --> 02:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
happened and so you're you're engaging
 
02:50:51.990 --> 02:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
the students as opposed to i want to
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
learn french but if you haven't engaged
 
02:50:56.309 --> 02:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
them first then we end up with what
 
02:50:57.750 --> 02:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative ford said you have
 
02:50:59.670 --> 02:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
students who are required to take a
 
02:51:01.590 --> 02:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
language they go through two years or
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
three years of the language and they
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't master it
 
02:51:07.030 --> 02:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
because it's a requirement not an
 
02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:09.190 align:start position:0%
because it's a requirement not an
engagement

02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
so this is where again it's a bold move
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
i get it right we're trying to be bold
 
02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:13.510 align:start position:0%
i get it right we're trying to be bold
here

02:51:13.510 --> 02:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:51:15.830 --> 02:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
but we're in in this boldness it's not
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
like we're
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know uh jettisoning everything we're
 
02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
basically saying like let's focus
 
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative baum
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:28.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
commissioner

02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
to follow up
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:51:32.399 --> 02:51:33.110 align:start position:0%
all right
and

02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:35.510 --> 02:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
right now in law the adequate education
 
02:51:40.230 --> 02:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
says as music has art has has languages
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
has part of an adequate education but
 
02:51:46.710 --> 02:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
yet they're not mandatory in the schools
 
02:51:47.990 --> 02:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
isn't that right
 
02:51:49.429 --> 02:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
i know they're having they're teaching
 
02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
all these subjects
 
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah but i mean the point is the schools
 
02:51:56.389 --> 02:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
offer them but they're not really the
 
02:51:58.230 --> 02:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
law says they're part of an adequate
 
02:51:58.240 --> 02:51:59.429 align:start position:0%
law says they're part of an adequate
education

02:51:59.429 --> 02:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:52:01.349 --> 02:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
but they're
 
02:52:03.110 --> 02:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
they're elective courses in a lot of
 
02:52:05.349 --> 02:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
high schools they're not mandatory so
 
02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
but but they still have to offer the
 
02:52:08.469 --> 02:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
high schools out of the minimum
 
02:52:10.309 --> 02:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
standards um but again what you're
 
02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
finding is then so students are are
 
02:52:15.349 --> 02:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
checking off boxes as opposed to
 
02:52:16.870 --> 02:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
focusing on
 
02:52:18.710 --> 02:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know making sure that they get
 
02:52:20.950 --> 02:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
the foundational stuff down because what
 
02:52:23.190 --> 02:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
we do is we cram another item into the
 
02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh already busy you know and limited day
 
02:52:28.710 --> 02:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i'm saying here this
 
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
will not really change anything
 
02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.070 --> 02:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
i think it helps us to focus our effort
 
02:52:40.710 --> 02:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
and again if i look at six decades of
 
02:52:42.550 --> 02:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
not being able to figure out how to get
 
02:52:44.389 --> 02:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
this thing forward
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know that this is uh i think that
 
02:52:49.110 --> 02:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
that type of focus and the way that
 
02:52:51.349 --> 02:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
we've architected it here
 
02:52:53.349 --> 02:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
allows us to do that focus
 
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
the you know at best the focus allows us
 
02:52:58.309 --> 02:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
to close some of those disparity gaps at
 
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:05.349 --> 02:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
i was wondering
 
02:53:07.830 --> 02:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
since this is a bold move
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
how much of this or is any of this going
 
02:53:13.110 --> 02:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
to be applicable to charter schools
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
as part of our public school system
 
02:53:17.269 --> 02:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so i would assume that so the
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
churches are public schools and so they
 
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
also go through i believe um you know
 
02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
the same adequate education law so
 
02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:27.670 align:start position:0%
the same adequate education law so
representative

02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're not required as far as i
 
02:53:30.960 --> 02:53:32.550 align:start position:0%
they're not required as far as i
understand

02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
to follow the education laws unless it's
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
specifically stated in those education
 
02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
laws and i don't see it specifically
 
02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
stated here so what i'm wondering is how
 
02:53:45.429 --> 02:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
is actually going to be used in charter
 
02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
schools and how much
 
02:53:51.429 --> 02:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
will be up to them to pick and choose
 
02:53:52.710 --> 02:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
what they want to use and what they
 
02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to use right so the content
 
02:53:56.710 --> 02:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
is the same so you don't see it in this
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
law but you would see it over in 194b
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
which tells the charter schools that
 
02:54:01.269 --> 02:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
they have to teach the new hampshire
 
02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
academic standards so that stuff pulls
 
02:54:04.950 --> 02:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
over that way so i don't think that
 
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
there's any disparity there
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative waltz
 
02:54:14.389 --> 02:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:54:16.389 --> 02:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
um commissioner
 
02:54:18.309 --> 02:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of integrated education
 
02:54:20.469 --> 02:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
was a hot topic in the 1990s
 
02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
and there were schools that designed
 
02:54:23.429 --> 02:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
their whole programs around doing
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
integrated into education there are some
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
major shortfalls of trying to take an
 
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
approach of integrated education where
 
02:54:33.269 --> 02:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
kids have huge gaps and what they didn't
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
learn when you're focused on the
 
02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
integrated education as opposed to the
 
02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
more traditional education where you're
 
02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
trying to to silo some of these things
 
02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if in putting forth
 
02:54:46.550 --> 02:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
which is really just another version of
 
02:54:48.230 --> 02:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
integrated education is what you're
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
proposing here if you have looked at
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
those programs the reasons people moved
 
02:54:55.190 --> 02:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
away from them the aspects that failed
 
02:54:58.389 --> 02:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
and the aspects that worked
 
02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
so happy to answer that question um so
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is not the same as the previous
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
integrated education because in the
 
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
previous educated
 
02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
integrated education
 
02:55:09.750 --> 02:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
there was not the focal point right it
 
02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
was like you have all these subjects do
 
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
them all but just mix them up and do
 
02:55:15.830 --> 02:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
them together uh well that is how most
 
02:55:17.830 --> 02:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
of that was done and what i would tell
 
02:55:21.190 --> 02:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
you is while your statement that the
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
integrated education
 
02:55:25.590 --> 02:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
revealed gaps in that education those
 
02:55:27.990 --> 02:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
gaps existed before integrated education
 
02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they exist after integrated
 
02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
education and so i what i would tell you
 
02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:32.950 align:start position:0%
education and so i what i would tell you
is

02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
the gaps are persistent and they're
 
02:55:37.510 --> 02:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:39.429 --> 02:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
can i follow up
 
02:55:40.710 --> 02:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
quickly please
 
02:55:42.630 --> 02:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
so i'll give you a really good example
 
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
my kids beau moved to the integrated
 
02:55:46.150 --> 02:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
system which is where my kids went to
 
02:55:48.870 --> 02:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
school they took
 
02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
math down integrated math one that was
 
02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to be basically algebra and
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
then they went to a private school for
 
02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
the balance of the high school and
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
actually one also did the integrated two
 
02:56:00.790 --> 02:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
there they got to the private school and
 
02:56:03.429 --> 02:56:03.439 align:start position:0%
discovered huge gaps in their math
 
02:56:05.269 --> 02:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge they really hadn't learned
 
02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
algebra one they really hadn't learned
 
02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
geometry they had some basics but they
 
02:56:11.510 --> 02:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
hadn't really learned it
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
and they found this in other subject
 
02:56:16.230 --> 02:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
matters as well that there were huge
 
02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:17.269 align:start position:0%
matters as well that there were huge
gaps

02:56:17.269 --> 02:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
gaps
 
02:56:20.150 --> 02:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
so even with that program in one of the
 
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
best school districts in the state
 
02:56:26.630 --> 02:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
there were huge gaps and i'm it really
 
02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
was what what beau was doing is no
 
02:56:29.910 --> 02:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
different than what you're proposing
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
here and i am confused
 
02:56:34.309 --> 02:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
like as to why this is better i mean we
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
have you listed it you listed at the
 
02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
beginning all the attempts over the last
 
02:56:41.670 --> 02:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
50 years to reinvent education that
 
02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
haven't changed it because what you put
 
02:56:45.750 --> 02:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
in here the problem isn't this it's a
 
02:56:47.830 --> 02:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
socio-economic problem this doesn't
 
02:56:49.590 --> 02:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
address the underlying socioeconomic
 
02:56:52.150 --> 02:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
problems so i'm still confused as to how
 
02:56:54.389 --> 02:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
creating a system that now once again
 
02:56:56.950 --> 02:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
creates holes addresses the educational
 
02:56:59.110 --> 02:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
issues that are really founded on
 
02:57:01.110 --> 02:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic issues
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
so i would actually i'm not familiar
 
02:57:04.309 --> 02:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
with the bow program i can tell you that
 
02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
they continue to offer integrated
 
02:57:08.550 --> 02:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
education beau continues to be one of
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
the top performing schools in the state
 
02:57:13.110 --> 02:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire i'm sorry that your
 
02:57:14.790 --> 02:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
children didn't benefit from that
 
02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:16.070 align:start position:0%
children didn't benefit from that
instruction

02:57:16.070 --> 02:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
02:57:18.469 --> 02:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
and ended up with gaps in that
 
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
what i would tell you is that if what we
 
02:57:22.870 --> 02:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
can't avoid is we have to make sure that
 
02:57:24.790 --> 02:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
we're focused on english language arts
 
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
arithmetic and mathematics natural and
 
02:57:28.870 --> 02:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
physical science and social studies if
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
we give our students those things we've
 
02:57:33.269 --> 02:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
equipped them to be lifelong learners
 
02:57:36.230 --> 02:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
and effective citizens
 
02:57:38.070 --> 02:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative luno
 
02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks again uh uh
 
02:57:42.389 --> 02:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question so
 
02:57:44.469 --> 02:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
um so following on what representative
 
02:57:47.830 --> 02:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
walls is talking about and the
 
02:57:49.830 --> 02:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
the phrase that you just used that gaps
 
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
are persistent and they're still there
 
02:57:53.910 --> 02:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
and they're certainly there
 
02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:54.790 align:start position:0%
and they're certainly there
um

02:57:54.790 --> 02:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:56.950 --> 02:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i'll pick a couple of
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of school districts
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
hannover and newport
 
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
um how is this going to close the gap in
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
student opportunities
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
between hanover and newport because it's
 
02:58:10.469 --> 02:58:10.479 align:start position:0%
going to allow my instructional staff in
 
02:58:12.870 --> 02:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
newport to focus on these core
 
02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:14.790 align:start position:0%
newport to focus on these core
foundational

02:58:14.790 --> 02:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
foundational
 
02:58:17.590 --> 02:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
subject areas right and hone in on them
 
02:58:19.910 --> 02:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
put the big blocks into the box first
 
02:58:22.150 --> 02:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
and so when you because you identify you
 
02:58:24.070 --> 02:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
say hanover and newport have different
 
02:58:25.510 --> 02:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
performance they have different
 
02:58:27.910 --> 02:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
performances across these domains that
 
02:58:30.389 --> 02:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
we're testing here right and so by
 
02:58:31.990 --> 02:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
focusing the instruction on there and
 
02:58:33.750 --> 02:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
not trying to fit more things into the
 
02:58:36.070 --> 02:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
day in newport maybe they can make up
 
02:58:37.269 --> 02:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
the gaps for the economically
 
02:58:38.630 --> 02:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged kids that are not
 
02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise being able to close that gap
 
02:58:43.030 --> 02:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
so follow-up
 
02:58:43.040 --> 02:58:44.469 align:start position:0%
so follow-up
so

02:58:44.469 --> 02:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:46.469 --> 02:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
i mean just going with your analogy
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
which i think is is maybe not you know
 
02:58:51.750 --> 02:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
square on the mark here but uh doesn't
 
02:58:53.830 --> 02:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
hanover have a bigger box or a bigger
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
bucket than newport to begin with
 
02:58:58.790 --> 02:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
sure in what sense uh they have a whole
 
02:59:00.870 --> 02:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
all of them have in terms of access to
 
02:59:02.790 --> 02:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
financial resources so but that's not
 
02:59:04.550 --> 02:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
the box the box of the children that
 
02:59:06.870 --> 02:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to you know fill up with
 
02:59:08.550 --> 02:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
the core knowledge that they want so
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
your analogy is not consistent you just
 
02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
said the boxes the hours and the day and
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
the the availability resources so
 
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
newport fill up the box with the big
 
02:59:20.710 --> 02:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
rocks first before you put the sand in
 
02:59:22.469 --> 02:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
hanover just happens to have a bigger
 
02:59:24.790 --> 02:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
box they can put the big rocks and the
 
02:59:28.150 --> 02:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
sand and a lot more sand yeah so so
 
02:59:30.070 --> 02:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
what's what's closing the opportunity
 
02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
gap here
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
so what's closing the opportunity gap is
 
02:59:36.790 --> 02:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
that we have an opportunity in newport
 
02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to focus our instructional
 
02:59:38.720 --> 02:59:39.590 align:start position:0%
to be able to focus our instructional
time

02:59:39.590 --> 02:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:59:42.230 --> 02:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
and to those students who to
 
02:59:44.469 --> 02:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
representative walters comment the
 
02:59:45.990 --> 02:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged kids who are
 
02:59:48.469 --> 02:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
falling behind can now we can spend more
 
02:59:50.309 --> 02:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
time with them
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
in these subjects that they are
 
02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
deficient in that they are falling
 
02:59:55.910 --> 02:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
behind in to try and move them up and i
 
02:59:57.670 --> 02:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
would tell you that the thing that we're
 
03:00:01.269 --> 03:00:01.279 align:start position:0%
trying to fill up is so the box is i
 
03:00:03.110 --> 03:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
have a fixed day but what i'm trying to
 
03:00:05.349 --> 03:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
fill up are my students with information
 
03:00:07.750 --> 03:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
and if your students in hanover can
 
03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
master algebra in an hour and a half and
 
03:00:11.590 --> 03:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
so he can move on and he's doing the
 
03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
french but my other student over in
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
representative walters district needs
 
03:00:17.910 --> 03:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
two hours to do that why would i not say
 
03:00:19.910 --> 03:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
to the school you have the flexibility
 
03:00:21.670 --> 03:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
focus on these things and make sure that
 
03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
everyone gets these correct as opposed
 
03:00:26.230 --> 03:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
to cutting everybody off in an hour and
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
a half and moving on and leaving those
 
03:00:29.830 --> 03:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
kids behind because they're the that's
 
03:00:33.750 --> 03:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner uh is this quick
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
mr representative woodcock well i have
 
03:00:40.230 --> 03:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
been waiting
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i will make it as quick as the
 
03:00:43.269 --> 03:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner answered that yes christian
 
03:00:46.150 --> 03:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate the the commentary uh
 
03:00:52.630 --> 03:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
from the get-go honestly in the dialogue
 
03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
can you i'm looking at the the line that
 
03:00:57.990 --> 03:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
talks about the adequate education
 
03:01:00.389 --> 03:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be defined as
 
03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
rigorous academic study
 
03:01:04.309 --> 03:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
can you explain that to me rigorous
 
03:01:06.469 --> 03:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
academic study sure i mean that is
 
03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
language that's consistent with the
 
03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
statute today and it is basically
 
03:01:12.309 --> 03:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
rigorous academic study means that we're
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
challenging our students right so
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
students we don't want to
 
03:01:18.309 --> 03:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
um you know continue if they're in high
 
03:01:19.910 --> 03:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
school they shouldn't be reading at a
 
03:01:21.269 --> 03:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
second grade level we should always be
 
03:01:23.510 --> 03:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
challenging them to be able to read uh
 
03:01:25.110 --> 03:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
beyond that so
 
03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
rigorous is referring to the the
 
03:01:28.710 --> 03:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
challenge that we bring so that would
 
03:01:31.269 --> 03:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
bring students to new places
 
03:01:33.190 --> 03:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
so so it's not it's not a measurable
 
03:01:34.710 --> 03:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
piece i mean there's no
 
03:01:36.870 --> 03:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
way to assess that rigorous academic
 
03:01:39.269 --> 03:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
study from one district to another
 
03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
um there's not a quantitative measurable
 
03:01:43.990 --> 03:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
definition of rigorous probably not the
 
03:01:45.990 --> 03:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
measure is the accountability system
 
03:01:46.950 --> 03:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
which is the assessments that
 
03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative luna is referring to
 
03:01:50.950 --> 03:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
so the uh it's all part of the same
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
question replica
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
so the assessment pieces that you were
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
talking the national assessment
 
03:01:56.389 --> 03:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
standards the two or three ones you
 
03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
identified that is going to be the
 
03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
determinant of the rigorous academic
 
03:02:02.469 --> 03:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
study so what i will tell you is that is
 
03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
the standard today and that is the
 
03:02:06.469 --> 03:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
standard that we are all measuring
 
03:02:09.190 --> 03:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves against um we get federal
 
03:02:10.950 --> 03:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
funding because we participate in those
 
03:02:12.710 --> 03:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
standards in those assessments that's
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
going to be the measure
 
03:02:15.510 --> 03:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
that is our measure that we have today
 
03:02:17.030 --> 03:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
if this board wants to come up with this
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
board that's fine but let me just be
 
03:02:20.550 --> 03:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
clear so this board has passed a law
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
that says that we will administer this
 
03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
assessment if this board wants to give
 
03:02:25.910 --> 03:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
me another academic you know measure
 
03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
then i'm happy to try and you know
 
03:02:28.870 --> 03:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
implement that
 
03:02:31.030 --> 03:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
let me just go back to the i know i know
 
03:02:32.309 --> 03:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
rather than cordelia loving the third
 
03:02:33.670 --> 03:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
question they
 
03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
go back to the third part we said
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
you're talking about bold
 
03:02:40.710 --> 03:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
and requiring districts to step up
 
03:02:43.030 --> 03:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
to provide i was based on that rigorous
 
03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
study more
 
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
professional development more evaluation
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
more critical thinking teachers
 
03:02:50.230 --> 03:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
performing better so students perform
 
03:02:52.950 --> 03:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
better more engagement that whole piece
 
03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
are you bold enough to say or is this
 
03:02:57.990 --> 03:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
legislation bold enough to say that the
 
03:03:00.230 --> 03:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
high school diploma
 
03:03:01.349 --> 03:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
will be
 
03:03:01.359 --> 03:03:02.550 align:start position:0%
will be
uh

03:03:02.550 --> 03:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:03:05.670 --> 03:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
on the on the level of proficiency
 
03:03:07.990 --> 03:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
so if you're telling us that 90 of the
 
03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
people are getting high school diplomas
 
03:03:12.150 --> 03:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
with 50 proficiency i think that was a
 
03:03:13.670 --> 03:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
statement to use
 
03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
is this is this bold enough to say that
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's no high school diploma
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
you cannot get to that
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
proficient area you should not be
 
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh eligible for high school deformers is
 
03:03:25.670 --> 03:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
that is that bull are we gonna do that
 
03:03:27.190 --> 03:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
are you gonna do that so that is a
 
03:03:28.950 --> 03:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
policy for example that massachusetts
 
03:03:30.630 --> 03:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
implemented a number of years ago with
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
their mcats um it is not a policy that
 
03:03:35.269 --> 03:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
our legislature has passed but if that
 
03:03:37.349 --> 03:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
is something that this legislature wants
 
03:03:38.950 --> 03:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
to entertain how we can have that
 
03:03:42.070 --> 03:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
conversation i think that this is uh you
 
03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
know bold but not it's not it's not as
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
disruptive as that type of a of a
 
03:03:49.269 --> 03:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
measure this is really bold in the sense
 
03:03:51.269 --> 03:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
that we're saying we're signaling quite
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
clearly this is what is really important
 
03:03:56.150 --> 03:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
that we can't not have this you know get
 
03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:57.190 align:start position:0%
that we can't not have this you know get
done

03:03:57.190 --> 03:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:03:59.910 --> 03:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
last one last guarantee the but the end
 
03:04:02.469 --> 03:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
bucket the end bucket then
 
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
based on that of the
 
03:04:06.389 --> 03:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
mcas was disruptive it is now
 
03:04:06.399 --> 03:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
mcas was disruptive it is now
effective

03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
effective
 
03:04:09.429 --> 03:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
based on that bucket
 
03:04:12.230 --> 03:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
under these percentiles
 
03:04:14.230 --> 03:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
fifty percent full is going to be
 
03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
adequate in new hampshire
 
03:04:18.389 --> 03:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
let's try to understand the question if
 
03:04:19.590 --> 03:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
ninety percent of our youngsters i
 
03:04:22.630 --> 03:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
haven't hit the 50 level so 50
 
03:04:23.830 --> 03:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
03:04:25.349 --> 03:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
that's us we're going to be a bull
 
03:04:25.359 --> 03:04:28.389 align:start position:0%
that's us we're going to be a bull
standard

03:04:28.389 --> 03:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
so well i mean so this is a step in in
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
the direction of bold but what you're
 
03:04:34.070 --> 03:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
saying is we want 100 of our kids to get
 
03:04:36.309 --> 03:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
to proficiency how bold are you willing
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
to make the high school diploma we're
 
03:04:39.190 --> 03:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
saying half the kids are already failing
 
03:04:40.309 --> 03:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
but we're going to give him a diploma
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you thank you
 
03:04:45.269 --> 03:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you very much
 
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
commissioners see no further questions
 
03:04:53.269 --> 03:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
we'll end the hearing on hb 1671
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
we're due to start up again at one
 
03:04:56.640 --> 03:04:58.070 align:start position:0%
we're due to start up again at one
o'clock

03:04:58.070 --> 03:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
03:04:58.080 --> 03:04:59.030 align:start position:0%
o'clock
um

03:04:59.030 --> 03:04:59.040 align:start position:0%

03:05:03.590 --> 03:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
next bill
 
03:05:05.429 --> 03:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
we have we have nobody else speaking
 
03:05:07.269 --> 03:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli

03:46:56.150 --> 03:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:46:58.150 --> 03:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
members of the education committee for
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
the record my name is representative
 
03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
erica leon representing derry
 
03:47:06.150 --> 03:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
when i put this bill together um with my
 
03:47:08.710 --> 03:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors we looked at a couple of the
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
details that i had wish bin had been
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
straightened out a little bit more last
 
03:47:14.710 --> 03:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
year around but it was it was a big
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
undertaking and i appreciate everything
 
03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
that was passed
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
one of the areas that i thought was
 
03:47:21.349 --> 03:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
important is
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
that these this isn't funding that's
 
03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
going directly to any of these
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
institutions this is going to the
 
03:47:29.830 --> 03:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
parents in order to provide an education
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
for their students so they're taking
 
03:47:34.870 --> 03:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
this money going to approved providers
 
03:47:36.790 --> 03:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
but they may be choosing from multiple
 
03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
different providers or they may be
 
03:47:41.590 --> 03:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
meeting 95 percent of the education
 
03:47:43.189 --> 03:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
that they're required to provide
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
underneath this
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
at say a private school but there may be
 
03:47:49.349 --> 03:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
some part of the education that they
 
03:47:50.790 --> 03:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
provide that isn't part of the
 
03:47:50.800 --> 03:47:51.910 align:start position:0%
provide that isn't part of the
curriculum

03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
03:47:54.150 --> 03:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that that school isn't
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
meeting anything it just
 
03:47:57.910 --> 03:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
clarified the parent still needs to make
 
03:47:59.349 --> 03:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
sure that they are receiving that
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
education whether or not they're
 
03:48:03.189 --> 03:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
directly purchasing it from somebody so
 
03:48:05.030 --> 03:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
i thought that having the language that
 
03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
i put on page one line six through ten
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
would help make that clear so that
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
future legislatures and everybody else
 
03:48:13.910 --> 03:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
would be a little bit more clear in the
 
03:48:16.870 --> 03:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
intent that this the parent is directing
 
03:48:18.630 --> 03:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
where they get the education and where
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
they spend the mountain the money from
 
03:48:20.640 --> 03:48:23.110 align:start position:0%
they spend the mountain the money from
this

03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
i'm also concerned about privacy i know
 
03:48:26.950 --> 03:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's something that is very important
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
to us here in new hampshire we have
 
03:48:30.550 --> 03:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
article 2b and i hear we hear that
 
03:48:32.790 --> 03:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
constantly over in hhs and i believe you
 
03:48:34.950 --> 03:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
hear it here as well
 
03:48:37.590 --> 03:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
the portfolio review
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
is something that is
 
03:48:41.670 --> 03:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
a work product of the student so that
 
03:48:43.670 --> 03:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
should be something that remains part of
 
03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
the student's portfolio and doesn't get
 
03:48:48.630 --> 03:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
handed directly to the state
 
03:48:49.750 --> 03:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
was added in lines 24-27
 
03:48:54.870 --> 03:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
of page one
 
03:48:57.670 --> 03:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate that there have been
 
03:48:59.590 --> 03:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
there have been quite a few opinions
 
03:48:59.600 --> 03:49:00.630 align:start position:0%
there have been quite a few opinions
that

03:49:00.630 --> 03:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
the art the withdrawal language saying
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
that upon notice the scholarship
 
03:49:07.750 --> 03:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
organization an efa student may choose
 
03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
to stop receiving efa funding and enroll
 
03:49:12.150 --> 03:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
full-time in a public school
 
03:49:14.309 --> 03:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're not able to go
 
03:49:15.990 --> 03:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
to any of the other options that that's
 
03:49:17.429 --> 03:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
intended to make sure that they still
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
have a place at the resident district
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
just like every other child in this
 
03:49:21.600 --> 03:49:22.870 align:start position:0%
just like every other child in this
state

03:49:22.870 --> 03:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
i prefer the language making it clear it
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
can be any other way to satisfy educate
 
03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
satisfy compulsory education but i
 
03:49:32.070 --> 03:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
understand that that is the intent of
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
the words that are in there this is just
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
just trying to be a little more clear
 
03:49:38.070 --> 03:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
for posterity
 
03:49:40.710 --> 03:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
and in order to make sure that we
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
are keeping that same intent
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
that a student won't be denied re-entry
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
into the public school in their resident
 
03:49:47.279 --> 03:49:48.469 align:start position:0%
into the public school in their resident
district

03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's the language added on lines 12
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
and 13.
 
03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
so those were the specific parts that i
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
had when i was drafting it but my
 
03:49:59.189 --> 03:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
intention as well was to be able to look
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
at what was happening with jalcar look
 
03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
at how this is evolving and see what
 
03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
other problems
 
03:50:06.070 --> 03:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
what other clarification i wouldn't say
 
03:50:07.590 --> 03:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
problem so what other clarifications
 
03:50:08.790 --> 03:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
03:50:10.309 --> 03:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
i would be very open to addressing any
 
03:50:15.030 --> 03:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
of the problems that are coming through
 
03:50:16.630 --> 03:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
or any of the questions that are there
 
03:50:17.990 --> 03:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
anything that should be resolved in
 
03:50:20.630 --> 03:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
legislation now but i also
 
03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we not i may not have a
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
more full understanding of exactly which
 
03:50:28.790 --> 03:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
tweaks we would like to see until later
 
03:50:31.189 --> 03:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
on after the session after we've we
 
03:50:33.510 --> 03:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
finished meeting this year in may and it
 
03:50:35.189 --> 03:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
may be something that
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
either we can we can find the right
 
03:50:39.830 --> 03:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
language now or we could interim study
 
03:50:41.349 --> 03:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
it if we need to
 
03:50:43.510 --> 03:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
look at a group in the future i i leave
 
03:50:46.229 --> 03:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
that in your hands to be able to use
 
03:50:48.150 --> 03:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
this as the best vehicle to improve this
 
03:50:48.160 --> 03:50:49.189 align:start position:0%
this as the best vehicle to improve this
program

03:50:49.189 --> 03:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
because it is a huge asset for families
 
03:50:54.389 --> 03:50:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's a huge benefit for families who
 
03:50:56.630 --> 03:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
can't otherwise afford to
 
03:50:58.950 --> 03:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
purchase educational materials a la
 
03:51:02.710 --> 03:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
carte or participate in private schools
 
03:51:06.070 --> 03:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
or in any of these other services
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i know dozens and dozens and dozens
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
of families for whom this has been
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
such a relief for them because money
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
that was going
 
03:51:17.910 --> 03:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
to buy educational materials last year
 
03:51:20.309 --> 03:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
out of their pocketbooks they're able to
 
03:51:22.150 --> 03:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
better cope with the increase in gas
 
03:51:22.160 --> 03:51:23.189 align:start position:0%
better cope with the increase in gas
prices

03:51:23.189 --> 03:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
prices
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
the increasing prices at the grocery
 
03:51:27.030 --> 03:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
store and they actually don't have much
 
03:51:28.950 --> 03:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
more room and flexibility than they did
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
last year but with these rising prices
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
they would have really been in a world
 
03:51:34.710 --> 03:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
of hurt because i know
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that that really it
 
03:51:38.790 --> 03:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
could be a choice between
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
getting getting free resources or what
 
03:51:43.510 --> 03:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
they're eating and i'm so glad that with
 
03:51:45.269 --> 03:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
this program people don't have to make
 
03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
that choice
 
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
because we are providing this
 
03:51:49.120 --> 03:51:50.309 align:start position:0%
because we are providing this
for

03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:51:52.630 --> 03:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
some of our lower income
 
03:51:54.790 --> 03:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
lower income people it's not always
 
03:51:56.469 --> 03:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
lower income you know i don't like to
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
draw that line because a lot of that
 
03:52:00.790 --> 03:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
depends on how you use your resources i
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
know some people on a really
 
03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
tight income
 
03:52:06.630 --> 03:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
that do an amazing job and they don't go
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
wanting because of how they shape their
 
03:52:08.640 --> 03:52:09.670 align:start position:0%
wanting because of how they shape their
choices

03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
choices
 
03:52:12.870 --> 03:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
so i want to appreciate that
 
03:52:14.630 --> 03:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
i just i don't want it to be drawing
 
03:52:16.229 --> 03:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
lines between
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
different groups of people but i really
 
03:52:19.510 --> 03:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we have this i would
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
like to make it stronger and i also
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
understand that this is
 
03:52:26.790 --> 03:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
a newer program and if now's not the
 
03:52:28.229 --> 03:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
time to make these changes i would
 
03:52:30.309 --> 03:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate that as well so with that
 
03:52:31.750 --> 03:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions thank you very
 
03:52:33.429 --> 03:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
much representative i have one question
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
for you on the first page
 
03:52:37.750 --> 03:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh line 25
 
03:52:39.429 --> 03:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about the parent
 
03:52:41.429 --> 03:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
shall provide only the evaluation
 
03:52:43.510 --> 03:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
document are you talking about the
 
03:52:46.790 --> 03:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation report
 
03:52:49.429 --> 03:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
the document is there certain criteria
 
03:52:52.229 --> 03:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
that should be in it or would it be
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
i guess the word report would really
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
tell me a lot more than just the word
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
document is that the evaluation
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
what is that you know
 
03:53:04.950 --> 03:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
what was it a test an assessment of some
 
03:53:07.349 --> 03:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
kind or was it you know a review of the
 
03:53:07.359 --> 03:53:09.590 align:start position:0%
kind or was it you know a review of the
portfolio

03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
portfolio
 
03:53:12.070 --> 03:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
that is intended to be for the portfolio
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
review because it's taught in the part
 
03:53:16.710 --> 03:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
talking about maintaining the portfolio
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
and have the it says the parent shall
 
03:53:20.870 --> 03:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
have a certified teacher a teacher
 
03:53:22.469 --> 03:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
currently teaching in non-public school
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
selected to evaluate the progress upon
 
03:53:27.670 --> 03:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
the portfolio review and discussion so
 
03:53:30.389 --> 03:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
that would be a document about the
 
03:53:33.030 --> 03:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation a report would be fine
 
03:53:34.710 --> 03:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
language to me
 
03:53:36.229 --> 03:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
i think that that's one of the things
 
03:53:38.710 --> 03:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
that specifically what they call that
 
03:53:41.429 --> 03:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
portfolio review evaluation is probably
 
03:53:43.030 --> 03:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to come through rules
 
03:53:44.389 --> 03:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:53:45.830 --> 03:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you have better language we can
 
03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
figure out how how to tie that in and
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps set the language for this
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
portfolio evaluation thank you
 
03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
yes representative waltz
 
03:53:57.510 --> 03:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:57.520 --> 03:53:58.389 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:53:58.389 --> 03:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
i must be misreading this and i'm
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
looking for help here
 
03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
because i'm looking at the first changes
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
on lines 7 through 9 through 10.
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
and to me what it does is it looks like
 
03:54:11.830 --> 03:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
it just relieves parents
 
03:54:13.990 --> 03:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
or anybody or a school or anybody from
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
complying with the educational
 
03:54:16.950 --> 03:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
requirements that we just considered in
 
03:54:19.189 --> 03:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
the last bill under section 193 of the
 
03:54:21.189 --> 03:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
law and it says they're not provided to
 
03:54:22.630 --> 03:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
change the course to fulfill these
 
03:54:22.640 --> 03:54:24.229 align:start position:0%
change the course to fulfill these
requirements

03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
but if they're not required to change
 
03:54:27.510 --> 03:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
the course to fulfill the requirements
 
03:54:30.150 --> 03:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
and they're not fulfilling them
 
03:54:32.070 --> 03:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's like it's exempting them from the
 
03:54:34.150 --> 03:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
basic requirements of education am i
 
03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
misreading this
 
03:54:38.229 --> 03:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and i
 
03:54:39.750 --> 03:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
believe you are
 
03:54:42.389 --> 03:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
this is dividing out what the education
 
03:54:42.399 --> 03:54:43.590 align:start position:0%
this is dividing out what the education
providers

03:54:43.590 --> 03:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
provide so if you're contracting with
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
just one a private school
 
03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
and you're the parent you may have a
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
separate education provider who you are
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
who which we are using to fulfill some
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:54:58.870 --> 03:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
let's say that
 
03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
you don't like the language program at
 
03:55:02.790 --> 03:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
the private school so instead you are
 
03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
going into a german club and immersing
 
03:55:07.349 --> 03:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
and paying for some membership fees
 
03:55:09.670 --> 03:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
if you aren't getting language at the
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
private school and instead the parent is
 
03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
choosing to fulfill that somewhere else
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
having the obligation on that private
 
03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
school to teach language
 
03:55:21.990 --> 03:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
when they are getting a superior program
 
03:55:24.469 --> 03:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
through one another resource
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a fair burden on that
 
03:55:29.830 --> 03:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
original education provider it is the
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
parent that signs a contract and not the
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
education providers and it is the
 
03:55:36.790 --> 03:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
parents duty as part of this contract to
 
03:55:39.030 --> 03:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that their student that their
 
03:55:42.309 --> 03:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
child receives the education as defined
 
03:55:44.710 --> 03:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
in 194 f3
 
03:55:44.720 --> 03:55:47.670 align:start position:0%
in 194 f3
3d1

03:55:47.670 --> 03:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:47.680 --> 03:55:48.630 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:55:48.630 --> 03:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:55:51.189 --> 03:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
so i understand that intention
 
03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm not convinced that's what this
 
03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
says i think under the rules of
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
statutory construction
 
03:55:58.790 --> 03:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
what this says is education providers
 
03:56:00.630 --> 03:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to basically
 
03:56:02.550 --> 03:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
change any program to meet the basic
 
03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
requirements set out in
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
lines three through six
 
03:56:06.800 --> 03:56:08.150 align:start position:0%
lines three through six
and

03:56:08.150 --> 03:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:56:09.910 --> 03:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things i've learned
 
03:56:11.830 --> 03:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
in my many years here is being be aware
 
03:56:14.150 --> 03:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
of unintended consequence and i think
 
03:56:16.150 --> 03:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
the way this is drafted that is an
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence is that you're
 
03:56:20.309 --> 03:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
basically saying education providers
 
03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
don't have to do what they need to do to
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements set out in the
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph above it and that's my concern
 
03:56:29.910 --> 03:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
as to the way i read it and i understand
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
that was not your intent but i do
 
03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
believe that is what the statutory
 
03:56:34.950 --> 03:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
construction says
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for that lines 9 and 10 state
 
03:56:39.429 --> 03:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
that the responsibility
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
remains with the parent to meet these
 
03:56:41.680 --> 03:56:43.189 align:start position:0%
remains with the parent to meet these
requirements

03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
further questions representative porter
 
03:56:56.469 --> 03:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
and then representative woodcock thank
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
you mr chair and thank you
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative um i want to go back to
 
03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
the um portfolio section section c
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at um and i know this is in
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
current law line 22
 
03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
it says the parent shall have a
 
03:57:13.590 --> 03:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
certified teacher or a teacher currently
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
teaching in a non-public school who was
 
03:57:18.710 --> 03:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
selected by the parent evaluate the
 
03:57:21.269 --> 03:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
students educational progress
 
03:57:23.510 --> 03:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
upon review of a portfolio
 
03:57:25.110 --> 03:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
and discussion with the parent or
 
03:57:25.120 --> 03:57:26.309 align:start position:0%
and discussion with the parent or
student

03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:57:28.630 --> 03:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm a sir i i'm no longer a certified
 
03:57:30.870 --> 03:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
teacher because i'm retired now but
 
03:57:32.950 --> 03:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
i was certified in early childhood
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
education grades k through three
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
and i would feel very comfortable
 
03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
evaluating a portfolio of a child in
 
03:57:43.349 --> 03:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
that age group
 
03:57:46.150 --> 03:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
however i would not be comfortable
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
evaluating a portfolio for high school
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
chemistry because i don't have an
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
expertise in that but it appears to me
 
03:57:54.309 --> 03:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
from this law
 
03:57:56.070 --> 03:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
that the parent could come to me and say
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
will you evaluate my high school
 
03:58:00.550 --> 03:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
chemistry uh kids portfolio
 
03:58:02.630 --> 03:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
um and that it would be perfectly all
 
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
right for me to do that so i'm wondering
 
03:58:07.110 --> 03:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
if you might perhaps put some language
 
03:58:07.120 --> 03:58:07.830 align:start position:0%
if you might perhaps put some language
in

03:58:07.830 --> 03:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:58:10.150 --> 03:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
that specifies that
 
03:58:12.229 --> 03:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
the teacher who is evaluating the
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
portfolio have some
 
03:58:17.990 --> 03:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
um certification or knowledge of the
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
area that's being
 
03:58:19.920 --> 03:58:22.550 align:start position:0%
area that's being
evaluated

03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
evaluated
 
03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your concern there i think
 
03:58:27.030 --> 03:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
that also comes down to the teacher
 
03:58:29.429 --> 03:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
because i know that you would not feel
 
03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing that and you would
 
03:58:33.269 --> 03:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
decline there needs to be an agreement
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
between both of them and
 
03:58:38.710 --> 03:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
that evaluation and review
 
03:58:41.830 --> 03:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
if you look at that so sorry
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
i get off into tangents i'm going to
 
03:58:45.750 --> 03:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
refocus right back here
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have a teacher who
 
03:58:50.469 --> 03:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
choosing to do that
 
03:58:52.630 --> 03:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
i believe that teachers are ethical
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
professionals and that they would only
 
03:58:57.030 --> 03:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate a student within their scope of
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge and i
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think that we have to legislate
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
for every small wrinkle of how somebody
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
may be dishonorable and instead realize
 
03:59:08.389 --> 03:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
that our teachers are a huge resource
 
03:59:09.990 --> 03:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
and a huge asset and they take what they
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
do seriously
 
03:59:13.510 --> 03:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
but still under the car under the way
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's written that could happen
 
03:59:18.550 --> 03:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
it could happen under this so you might
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
want to protect
 
03:59:21.590 --> 03:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
protect the students and the parents
 
03:59:27.429 --> 03:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh represent woodcock
 
03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good afternoon
 
03:59:33.510 --> 03:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
welcome to our late starting community
 
03:59:33.520 --> 03:59:34.309 align:start position:0%
welcome to our late starting community
um

03:59:34.309 --> 03:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:34.319 --> 03:59:35.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:59:35.910 --> 03:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:37.510 --> 03:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
i was going to follow up on
 
03:59:40.469 --> 03:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
representative west on the end on
 
03:59:42.070 --> 03:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
line seven
 
03:59:44.469 --> 03:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
if if the
 
03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
private organization that the parents
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
are taking their child to
 
03:59:51.269 --> 03:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to follow the requirements
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
as exhibit up above what they should do
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
for core requirements
 
03:59:56.550 --> 03:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
and it still remains under be the
 
03:59:58.229 --> 03:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the parent why do you
 
04:00:00.150 --> 04:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
even have that in there
 
04:00:02.229 --> 04:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
what's the value of if they don't follow
 
04:00:03.910 --> 04:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
it they don't need to provide it they
 
04:00:05.830 --> 04:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
don't need to modify the curriculum why
 
04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
would you have it there because as you
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
said the underlying responsibility to
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
remains of the parents
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the
 
04:00:15.269 --> 04:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility is on the parent it's on
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
the parent to provide that education
 
04:00:19.830 --> 04:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
that meets those standards it does not
 
04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
require that efa funds are spent on each
 
04:00:24.630 --> 04:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
of those portions because it's not
 
04:00:26.710 --> 04:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
dictating where you're using these you
 
04:00:28.790 --> 04:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
may simply go and be going for intensive
 
04:00:30.630 --> 04:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
work in one area when you're one of
 
04:00:33.269 --> 04:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
these a la carte students it's less of
 
04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
an issue for those who are getting all
 
04:00:37.030 --> 04:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
of their education from one
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
provider but even then
 
04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
they may not
 
04:00:42.229 --> 04:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
there still can be instruction at home
 
04:00:43.830 --> 04:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
even if you're full-time enrolled in a
 
04:00:43.840 --> 04:00:48.309 align:start position:0%
even if you're full-time enrolled in a
school

04:00:48.309 --> 04:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
i understand that i just don't i
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
understand that um but i don't
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
understand why line seven is there at
 
04:00:55.990 --> 04:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
all why you need it
 
04:00:57.670 --> 04:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you the money doesn't go
 
04:00:59.590 --> 04:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
directly to the schools the contract is
 
04:01:01.910 --> 04:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
not with the education provider it is
 
04:01:03.349 --> 04:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
with the parent
 
04:01:04.389 --> 04:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
04:01:07.110 --> 04:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
who chooses how to do that is the one
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for allocation of funds
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
so in this case the first two words
 
04:01:14.070 --> 04:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
education provider you're saying that's
 
04:01:15.110 --> 04:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
04:01:17.110 --> 04:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
no okay so why why does it why do we
 
04:01:18.870 --> 04:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
need that line in there at all that's my
 
04:01:23.189 --> 04:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.790 --> 04:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
i think that the number of questions we
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
have around it is it explains some of
 
04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
why we need it
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
if there's a move to make sure that
 
04:01:32.229 --> 04:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
anybody taking these funds checks every
 
04:01:34.150 --> 04:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
single box on this even if they're not a
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
full-time or even if the parent is
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
choosing to provide some of this
 
04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
education this provides needed clarity
 
04:01:43.510 --> 04:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
to show that the education provider
 
04:01:47.269 --> 04:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
provides a poor apportion or all
 
04:01:49.510 --> 04:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
of the education that's required and
 
04:01:51.110 --> 04:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
that the parent maintains the
 
04:01:51.120 --> 04:01:52.630 align:start position:0%
that the parent maintains the
responsibility

04:01:52.630 --> 04:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:01:54.710 --> 04:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
for the student meeting those
 
04:01:54.720 --> 04:01:55.990 align:start position:0%
for the student meeting those
requirements

04:01:55.990 --> 04:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:02:01.269 --> 04:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
i got one follow-up on on line seven
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
there where we were just talking about
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
what would happen if we scratched
 
04:02:07.750 --> 04:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
lines seven and eight
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
and then had versus b
 
04:02:13.510 --> 04:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fulfill stu study
 
04:02:16.070 --> 04:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
requirements for students participating
 
04:02:18.070 --> 04:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the efa program remain with the
 
04:02:18.080 --> 04:02:19.910 align:start position:0%
in the efa program remain with the
parent

04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:02:24.790 --> 04:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:26.309 --> 04:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
wonderful excuse mr chairman it does
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
sound beautifully from your voice that's
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
exactly what i'm asking i asked it three
 
04:02:30.239 --> 04:02:31.910 align:start position:0%
exactly what i'm asking i asked it three
times

04:02:31.910 --> 04:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
times
 
04:02:33.189 --> 04:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
but you've made it so much better
 
04:02:35.429 --> 04:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
sharing life oh thank you i
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i might still have a couple
 
04:02:36.960 --> 04:02:42.309 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i might still have a couple
scars

04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:42.319 --> 04:02:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:02:43.030 --> 04:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't object to that type of
 
04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:48.319 --> 04:02:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:02:49.030 --> 04:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:02:51.429 --> 04:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
the point is that the response i i guess
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
the responsibility remains with the
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
parent not any not any particular
 
04:02:57.510 --> 04:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
education provider perhaps putting that
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
together because you're right that is
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
missing that i'm deferring to my former
 
04:03:01.120 --> 04:03:03.429 align:start position:0%
missing that i'm deferring to my former
chairman

04:03:03.429 --> 04:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
so responsibility remains with a parent
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
not any one education provider to meet
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
these requirements for all students
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
and what i said responsibility to
 
04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
fulfill study requirements for students
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
participating in the efa program
 
04:03:23.349 --> 04:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:23.359 --> 04:03:27.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's a thought uh reps and like us then
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:38.630 --> 04:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
hang on i can't see you from here
 
04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'll let you keep writing
 
04:03:41.520 --> 04:03:44.229 align:start position:0%
i'll let you keep writing
so

04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
my understanding and correct me if i'm
 
04:03:46.319 --> 04:03:47.429 align:start position:0%
my understanding and correct me if i'm
wrong

04:03:47.429 --> 04:03:47.439 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
the education providers
 
04:03:50.399 --> 04:03:51.349 align:start position:0%
the education providers
part

04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
part
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
is there
 
04:03:55.110 --> 04:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
so that the education provider doesn't
 
04:03:57.910 --> 04:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
feel compelled if they're taking efa
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
money to have to change things because i
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
know p it was a discussion that's been
 
04:04:06.630 --> 04:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
had is that while this provider you know
 
04:04:08.469 --> 04:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
they can't be a provider because they're
 
04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
not providing all of this and so it's
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
sort of a protection on the other end is
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
that the providers then know
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
no i don't have to do all of this i can
 
04:04:22.229 --> 04:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
provide the part that i provide
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm not
 
04:04:24.720 --> 04:04:26.150 align:start position:0%
and i'm not
ineligible

04:04:26.150 --> 04:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
ineligible
 
04:04:27.349 --> 04:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
to get this
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
money i mean you know to for the kid to
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
participate or for the provider to
 
04:04:34.710 --> 04:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
participate i'm not ineligible because i
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
don't do all of this because i have
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
heard people try to say oh that provider
 
04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed because they don't
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
fulfill all of these things and so it's
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
a way of protecting the providers to say
 
04:04:50.150 --> 04:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
no you're not expected to do everything
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
you do the part you do well
 
04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's the parent who has to make sure and
 
04:04:57.269 --> 04:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
fill in any parts that are missed right
 
04:04:59.349 --> 04:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
or that it's provided some other way is
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
that yes that is correct and that's why
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
i guess there was that hesitation that
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
um that it would be good so the
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fulfill the
 
04:05:10.479 --> 04:05:12.070 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fulfill the
requirements

04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
remains with the parent and not any one
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
education provider might be a way to
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
reflect that and respect that as well
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
just some way to make that clear without
 
04:05:25.110 --> 04:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
cutting it in such a way that it's going
 
04:05:26.229 --> 04:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:05:26.239 --> 04:05:27.590 align:start position:0%
to be
confusing

04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
because the point is to make sure that
 
04:05:32.710 --> 04:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
one education provider
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
isn't expected to do
 
04:05:40.710 --> 04:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative tanner than
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
representative ford thank you mr chair
 
04:05:46.870 --> 04:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for it's good to see you
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
back here i'm wondering on page 2 lines
 
04:05:51.429 --> 04:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
12 and 13
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
um it seems redundant be
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
and not necessary because if the child
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
is living
 
04:05:58.800 --> 04:05:59.590 align:start position:0%
is living
uh

04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
in a certain address then then they
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
have the right to go to public school
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
once the faa is done
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
04:06:11.670 --> 04:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know i just think it's
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
a duplication of what's already in the
 
04:06:13.439 --> 04:06:14.469 align:start position:0%
a duplication of what's already in the
law

04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:06:14.479 --> 04:06:16.630 align:start position:0%
law
and

04:06:16.630 --> 04:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why it's there i
 
04:06:18.080 --> 04:06:19.590 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why it's there i
guess

04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
guess
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i i do
 
04:06:23.110 --> 04:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
believe that it is their right to go
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
back to those schools as well i had
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
heard different discussions
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to put that in as a safety
 
04:06:28.800 --> 04:06:29.990 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to put that in as a safety
net

04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
net
 
04:06:33.269 --> 04:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
if it's very clear then that's
 
04:06:34.710 --> 04:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
if everybody understands that these
 
04:06:36.070 --> 04:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
students don't give up their right to go
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
back to the public school and be treated
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
just as any other student
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:51.670 --> 04:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:06:56.150 --> 04:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question i wonder whether the
 
04:06:58.469 --> 04:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
clarification you're looking for is then
 
04:06:58.479 --> 04:06:59.429 align:start position:0%
clarification you're looking for is then
worried

04:06:59.429 --> 04:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
worried
 
04:07:02.150 --> 04:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
to something to extend through whatever
 
04:07:06.070 --> 04:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
combination of providers is necessary
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
within that statement you had there the
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
the made to whatever sub-providers or
 
04:07:13.830 --> 04:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
whatever distinction you want to make so
 
04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
that they can be a combination of
 
04:07:17.830 --> 04:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
individual schools
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
all qualified individually for their
 
04:07:21.269 --> 04:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a good question but
 
04:07:24.870 --> 04:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
parents aren't defined as an education
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
provider in this because then they could
 
04:07:28.630 --> 04:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
be funded for providing the education
 
04:07:30.790 --> 04:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
for their own student so the parent may
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
be providing that education and that
 
04:07:35.910 --> 04:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
would come into our portfolio review and
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of the areas where a
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
portfolio review is more important when
 
04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
you're doing an a la carte because if
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
you're meeting one part of the statutes
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
here another part there that all should
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
come together in that portfolio to make
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
sure that you are meeting the
 
04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
requirements of the efa program
 
04:07:53.590 --> 04:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
and you may have paid for sixty percent
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
of it or eighty percent of it
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
or whichever par or a hundred percent of
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
it but the parent is not an education
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
provider under the terms of the statute
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
because they're not paid and the parent
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
should be able to fulfill those
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
educational requirements as part of that
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
and that's it for this hearing
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%

04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
with the precipitous arrival of the
 
04:18:02.790 --> 04:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts not much was
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
able to be done regarding the extensive
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
list of concerns that had been expressed
 
04:18:09.990 --> 04:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
with house bill 20 before new
 
04:18:11.830 --> 04:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire's voucher program was signed
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
into law
 
04:18:16.229 --> 04:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
the scope of my bill only scratches the
 
04:18:18.149 --> 04:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
surface but it does address the
 
04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
qualifications and background
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
of people who are being paid with state
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
funds to teach our children in
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
non-traditional settings
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
first house bill 1120 requires that
 
04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
enter any entity applying for funds as
 
04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
an education service provider be in
 
04:18:39.030 --> 04:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
service for a year before being accepted
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
as a participant
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
during that year student performance
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
data and financial viability data would
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
be able to be collected by the provider
 
04:18:49.510 --> 04:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
and shared with the scholarship
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
organization or the department of
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%

application process
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
we can't be too careful when the client
 
04:19:00.550 --> 04:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
is our children
 
04:19:03.110 --> 04:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
next any education service provider
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
offering instruction as a school or
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
program should be approved through the
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
non-public school approval process
 
04:19:14.710 --> 04:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
outlined in ed 400 administrative rules
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
there is a reason why every state board
 
04:19:19.830 --> 04:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
of education approved non-public school
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%

04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
it is essential to the educational
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
well-being of our students that they
 
04:19:29.429 --> 04:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
receive quality instruction with

oversight
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
and it is essential that students who
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
are participating in the state funded
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
efa program are guaranteed that safety

the third provision of the bill
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
literally deals with local and state

health and safety standards
 
04:19:52.710 --> 04:19:52.720 align:start position:0%

those recommendations ranged from things
 
04:20:03.429 --> 04:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
like assuring the kids aren't drinking

extended to efa students as well

the final aspect of the bill that i will
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to is on line 16 and
 
04:21:09.670 --> 04:21:09.680 align:start position:0%

04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
the law
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
currently prevent that law currently
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
prevents employment in a public school
 
04:21:26.870 --> 04:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
for anyone guilty of a section 5
 
04:21:29.429 --> 04:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
violation and i would propose that it
 
04:21:31.429 --> 04:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
should be applicable to education
 
04:21:33.670 --> 04:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
service providers too
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
when dzhokhar was delivering the
 
04:21:37.830 --> 04:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
deliberating the rules for the efa
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
program they noted that there was no
 
04:21:42.070 --> 04:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
provision in the new statute that
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
required a criminal background check for
 
04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
education service providers and no
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
stipulation that potentially barring
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
employment was tied to those results
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
this bill represents an attempt to
 
04:21:58.710 --> 04:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
correct those pitfalls of hastiness and
 
04:22:01.590 --> 04:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
further assure student safety
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for allowing me to
 
04:22:05.269 --> 04:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i am happy to take questions
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
questions of the presenter represent
 
04:22:13.590 --> 04:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
like us
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes i'm not sure how many of these apply
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
to all service providers for one
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
and so like if somebody was doing an
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
online course would they have to have
 
04:22:26.070 --> 04:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
health and safety
 
04:22:28.309 --> 04:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
stuff for their facility and codes and
 
04:22:31.349 --> 04:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:33.429 --> 04:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
is there a reason they have to be at
 
04:22:35.670 --> 04:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
least one year
 
04:22:35.680 --> 04:22:36.630 align:start position:0%
least one year
um

04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:39.030 --> 04:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
in order to participate
 
04:22:39.040 --> 04:22:40.149 align:start position:0%
in order to participate
um

04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
and a number of these other things i
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
think that's why
 
04:22:47.269 --> 04:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
our previous bill had that section in
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
there about not having to comply with
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
all this oh it was not lost on me
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative lacus as we were
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
listening to that testimony
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
because some of these just do not apply
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
a service provider might be something
 
04:23:04.149 --> 04:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
that teaches one
 
04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
small thing a service provider might be
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
something who specializes in say
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
dyslexia and is going to meet with a
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
student once every some number of weeks
 
04:23:17.110 --> 04:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
to work on a specific
 
04:23:19.189 --> 04:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
thing with that teacher and they may be
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
fully certified in dyslexia by a
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
different organization and not follow
 
04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
any of the rest of these things except
 
04:23:28.389 --> 04:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
for maybe the
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
the criminal history
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
check but
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
it seems awfully broad and full of rules
 
04:23:37.110 --> 04:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
for things that don't necessarily apply
 
04:23:37.120 --> 04:23:37.990 align:start position:0%
for things that don't necessarily apply
i

04:23:37.990 --> 04:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
am aware that there is no
 
04:23:40.159 --> 04:23:43.429 align:start position:0%
am aware that there is no
one-size-fits-all

04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
actually i thought of you because when i
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
originally submitted the bill
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
it was not submitted as one bill it came
 
04:23:54.950 --> 04:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
back from ols's one bill because the
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
provisions that i was referencing all
 
04:23:59.830 --> 04:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
had to do with uh educational service
 
04:23:59.840 --> 04:24:01.030 align:start position:0%
had to do with uh educational service
providers

04:24:01.030 --> 04:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
so it became uh
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
a buffet as opposed to an entree so uh i
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying to
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
your question a little more broadly what
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
i did when i was looking at the language
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
in house bill 20 on education service
 
04:24:20.080 --> 04:24:21.349 align:start position:0%
in house bill 20 on education service
providers

04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
was to
 
04:24:24.870 --> 04:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
try to uh
 
04:24:24.880 --> 04:24:26.309 align:start position:0%
try to uh
categorize

04:24:26.309 --> 04:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
categorize
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
what was happening around the country
 
04:24:30.720 --> 04:24:31.750 align:start position:0%
what was happening around the country
with

04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
other programs some similar maybe not
 
04:24:37.590 --> 04:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
quite in scope but similar in practice
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
so i looked at
 
04:24:43.590 --> 04:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
the financial financial stability aspect
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
and discovered that
 
04:24:46.080 --> 04:24:47.349 align:start position:0%
and discovered that
georgia

04:24:47.349 --> 04:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
georgia
 
04:24:47.359 --> 04:24:48.870 align:start position:0%
georgia
oklahoma

04:24:48.870 --> 04:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
oklahoma
 
04:24:48.880 --> 04:24:50.309 align:start position:0%
oklahoma
utah

04:24:50.309 --> 04:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
utah
 
04:24:54.389 --> 04:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
mississippi washington d.c
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
all require that their service providers
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
be in business for a year in order to
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
establish finance financial stability
 
04:25:02.560 --> 04:25:03.830 align:start position:0%
establish finance financial stability
records

04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
records
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
at before they can be accepted as a
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
service provider so i thought oh okay
 
04:25:10.630 --> 04:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
all right well that would in fact give
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
you time to
 
04:25:14.950 --> 04:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
for for whomever the scholarship
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
organization really to be able to sort
 
04:25:19.269 --> 04:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
of check things out
 
04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:23.110 --> 04:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
i got a question for you yes sir on this
 
04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
same line here i guess on five and six
 
04:25:26.870 --> 04:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
where you're talking about
 
04:25:29.670 --> 04:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
be around for one year prior
 
04:25:31.990 --> 04:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh to ensure financial sustainability
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
well the edsel was around for a couple
 
04:25:37.510 --> 04:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
years but then it was not sustainable
 
04:25:37.520 --> 04:25:38.389 align:start position:0%
years but then it was not sustainable
so

04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:38.399 --> 04:25:39.429 align:start position:0%
so
does

04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
being in business one year
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that you have financial
 
04:25:47.349 --> 04:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
sustainability or does it
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
identify some other aspect besides
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
finance i
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
would love to be able to answer that
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
question as an economist for you
 
04:25:58.149 --> 04:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative vlad um all i can say is
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
i'll repeat what i said to uh
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
representative lakis and that is the
 
04:26:04.469 --> 04:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
one-year standard
 
04:26:07.349 --> 04:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
seemed to be the most commonly put into
 
04:26:10.229 --> 04:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
place practice for other states that
 
04:26:10.239 --> 04:26:12.149 align:start position:0%
place practice for other states that
have

04:26:12.149 --> 04:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
voucher programs savings accounts
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
however whatever semantic language we
 
04:26:18.550 --> 04:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
want to use i mean basically what what
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
you're we're doing there was there was a
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
situation in north carolina i guess one
 
04:26:23.910 --> 04:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
in milwaukee
 
04:26:26.070 --> 04:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
where um
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
fraud was an issue i mean we've had
 
04:26:30.550 --> 04:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
fraud issues in new hampshire
 
04:26:33.510 --> 04:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so the intent is just for somebody
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
to be up and running long enough to be
 
04:26:38.550 --> 04:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
able to establish themselves as a
 
04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
legitimate business before
 
04:26:42.630 --> 04:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
they're out
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative porter
 
04:26:51.670 --> 04:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:26:51.680 --> 04:26:52.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
representative

04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:26:54.070 --> 04:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit of a would you
 
04:26:54.080 --> 04:26:55.030 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit of a would you
believe

04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
question i'm looking at um
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
section f line i think that's 15 local
 
04:27:04.710 --> 04:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
and state
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
health and safety standards
 
04:27:07.040 --> 04:27:07.910 align:start position:0%
health and safety standards
when

04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
and then this is for representative
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
moffat as well
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
when i ran my little school
 
04:27:15.110 --> 04:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
because it was not a because it was a
 
04:27:15.120 --> 04:27:16.149 align:start position:0%
because it was not a because it was a
case

04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
a pre-k
 
04:27:19.830 --> 04:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
i was not part of the department of
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
education i had to get licensed through
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
dhhs as a child care provider
 
04:27:27.910 --> 04:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
and the list of rules and regulations
 
04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
inspections that needed to be done on my
 
04:27:33.990 --> 04:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
property to make sure i was safe for
 
04:27:34.000 --> 04:27:35.269 align:start position:0%
property to make sure i was safe for
children

04:27:35.269 --> 04:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
really opened my eyes having just come
 
04:27:38.950 --> 04:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
from a public school where i taught
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and knowing what was there
 
04:27:45.110 --> 04:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
compared to what i had to provide so i
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
think it's wise of you to put this in
 
04:27:47.040 --> 04:27:48.790 align:start position:0%
think it's wise of you to put this in
because

04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:27:51.110 --> 04:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's something that's overlooked i think
 
04:27:52.790 --> 04:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
to a logic i mean every once in a while
 
04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
the fire department would come into the
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
public school and say you can't hang
 
04:27:57.590 --> 04:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
things from the ceiling
 
04:27:59.670 --> 04:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
and that kind of stuff but it was not to
 
04:28:00.870 --> 04:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
the depth
 
04:28:00.880 --> 04:28:02.149 align:start position:0%
the depth
of

04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
detail that i had to follow when i ran
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
the preschool kindergarten under dhhs
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
and that was all to keep the kids safe
 
04:28:11.670 --> 04:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
so i think thank you very much
 
04:28:14.389 --> 04:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative porter thank you um and
 
04:28:16.870 --> 04:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
also representative porter uh to to what
 
04:28:19.110 --> 04:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying um
 
04:28:21.510 --> 04:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
arkansas is probably the first state
 
04:28:23.670 --> 04:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
that put this provision into their
 
04:28:23.680 --> 04:28:25.030 align:start position:0%
that put this provision into their
program

04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
and uh their their
 
04:28:30.149 --> 04:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
provision was based on a situation in
 
04:28:34.070 --> 04:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
indiana where there were unsafe
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
there were kids in situations that were
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
unsafe in terms of uh not having any
 
04:28:41.189 --> 04:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
kind of inspection
 
04:28:43.670 --> 04:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
and again in washington dc there was a
 
04:28:46.309 --> 04:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
situation there where kids were
 
04:28:47.910 --> 04:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
in a place that didn't have running
 
04:28:49.429 --> 04:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
water and didn't have heat during the
 
04:28:55.510 --> 04:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
were there further questions
 
04:28:59.349 --> 04:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you take my question
 
04:29:01.279 --> 04:29:02.229 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you take my question
uh

04:29:02.229 --> 04:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's very reasonable well thought out to
 
04:29:06.630 --> 04:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
me but i do want to ask you a couple
 
04:29:08.950 --> 04:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
questions about um
 
04:29:08.960 --> 04:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
questions about um
line

04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:29:10.080 --> 04:29:11.349 align:start position:0%
line
seven

04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
seven
 
04:29:13.750 --> 04:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
let me give you two examples that you
 
04:29:17.189 --> 04:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
can respond to
 
04:29:20.309 --> 04:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
so if if a parent or family is looking
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
for some
 
04:29:21.760 --> 04:29:22.710 align:start position:0%
for some
beyond

04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
the basics but some specialized
 
04:29:26.309 --> 04:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
instructions say in the field of music
 
04:29:26.319 --> 04:29:27.189 align:start position:0%
instructions say in the field of music
or

04:29:27.189 --> 04:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the trades for example as an
 
04:29:29.359 --> 04:29:30.870 align:start position:0%
in the trades for example as an
apprentice

04:29:30.870 --> 04:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
apprentice
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
um so there are we probably all know
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
examples of
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
music people who teach uh they have a
 
04:29:40.469 --> 04:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
gift and skill music and they teach and
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
they take on people or somebody in the
 
04:29:45.990 --> 04:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
trades who has apprentices and you name
 
04:29:48.070 --> 04:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
it you know electric uh as an
 
04:29:50.149 --> 04:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
electrician whatever
 
04:29:50.159 --> 04:29:51.030 align:start position:0%
electrician whatever
so

04:29:51.030 --> 04:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:54.149 --> 04:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
if the providing instruction to students
 
04:29:54.159 --> 04:29:55.269 align:start position:0%
if the providing instruction to students
on

04:29:55.269 --> 04:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
approved non-public uh
 
04:30:00.149 --> 04:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
so my question is would this preclude
 
04:30:02.710 --> 04:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
like a specialized program that would
 
04:30:04.389 --> 04:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
have preclude like
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
an apprentice situation or a music
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
teacher who are not certified from being
 
04:30:10.070 --> 04:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
part of the mix
 
04:30:12.149 --> 04:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe so representative
 
04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
moffat i will tell you that that is the
 
04:30:16.630 --> 04:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
spot where that was supposed to be a
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
standalone and and that provision is
 
04:30:20.950 --> 04:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to read
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
any educational service provider that
 
04:30:28.149 --> 04:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
purports to be a school or a program has
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
to go through the ed 400
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
approval process
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
it does not read that way when it came
 
04:30:38.469 --> 04:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
back to me late in the drafting process
 
04:30:41.590 --> 04:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:43.510 --> 04:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
we agreed that we would wait until it
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
came before the committee and then if
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
there was an opportunity to
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
amend it we would do do so uh i do
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
believe that any service provider that
 
04:30:56.710 --> 04:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
is with a child
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
particularly alone
 
04:31:01.349 --> 04:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
should go through the background check
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
because i just think that that makes
 
04:31:05.189 --> 04:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
sense and i think that it allows parents
 
04:31:08.070 --> 04:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
to confidently allow people to work with
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
their kids without having to worry about
 
04:31:12.149 --> 04:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not they missed
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
something when they were screening
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
education service providers
 
04:31:19.349 --> 04:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
and i do believe that any education
 
04:31:22.229 --> 04:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
service provider that has a prescribed
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
program or is describing itself as a
 
04:31:25.520 --> 04:31:27.590 align:start position:0%
program or is describing itself as a
school

04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
should do
 
04:31:30.070 --> 04:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
what every
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
school a private schooler or non-public
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
school in new hampshire has done and
 
04:31:35.590 --> 04:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:31:39.990 --> 04:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
go to the ed 400 rules and utilize the
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
section that applies to them i mean if
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
you look at those rules
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
i just happen to have them in front of
 
04:31:46.080 --> 04:31:46.790 align:start position:0%
i just happen to have them in front of
me

04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:31:49.030 --> 04:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
if you look at the rules what you'll
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
find is that
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
different sections
 
04:31:52.640 --> 04:31:54.070 align:start position:0%
different sections
of

04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:31:56.229 --> 04:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
the ed 400
 
04:31:56.239 --> 04:31:57.189 align:start position:0%
the ed 400
rules

04:31:57.189 --> 04:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
deal with different aspects of
 
04:32:02.469 --> 04:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
non-public education
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
including the budget
 
04:32:05.670 --> 04:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
including the budget you know when we
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
were talking about um being open for a
 
04:32:10.630 --> 04:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
year if you go through the ed 400 rules
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
it's all over the place that before they
 
04:32:12.560 --> 04:32:13.670 align:start position:0%
it's all over the place that before they
will

04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:32:13.680 --> 04:32:14.950 align:start position:0%
will
approve

04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
approve
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
saint anywhere
 
04:32:18.550 --> 04:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
or uh
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
you know the little school of skipping
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
stones or whatever the you know whatever
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
the private organization is called they
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
have to provide a budget and demonstrate
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
financial feasibility before they'll be
 
04:32:33.830 --> 04:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
approved by the state board of ed
 
04:32:33.840 --> 04:32:39.189 align:start position:0%
approved by the state board of ed
you

04:32:39.189 --> 04:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:40.950 --> 04:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
question this is
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
probably for more from my edification
 
04:32:44.239 --> 04:32:45.269 align:start position:0%
probably for more from my edification
but

04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:32:46.229 --> 04:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
do all
 
04:32:49.030 --> 04:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh education service providers under the
 
04:32:51.750 --> 04:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship organizat do they have to be
 
04:32:53.110 --> 04:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
registered with a scholarship
 
04:32:54.790 --> 04:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
organization or registered with the
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
department of education or are they just
 
04:32:57.359 --> 04:32:58.630 align:start position:0%
department of education or are they just
uh

04:32:58.630 --> 04:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's no um

it representative tanner
 
04:33:20.709 --> 04:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
some of the education service providers
 
04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
are already on the state board of

scholarship organization
 
04:33:33.109 --> 04:33:33.119 align:start position:0%

parent and you have to and you're hiring
 
04:33:37.990 --> 04:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
an individual to work with your student
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%

04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
be vetted
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%

lot this uh this session about how words
 
05:05:31.120 --> 05:05:32.390 align:start position:0%
lot this uh this session about how words
matter

05:05:32.390 --> 05:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
matter
 
05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
and i agree words matter
 
05:05:36.868 --> 05:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
and the truth matters
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
and being honest and transparent with
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
our constituents matters
 
05:05:43.590 --> 05:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
matters a lot to me and i bet it matters
 
05:05:45.750 --> 05:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
to you too
 
05:05:47.350 --> 05:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
according to the national conference of
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
state legislatures school vouchers are
 
05:05:52.868 --> 05:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
state-funded scholarships that pay for
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
students to attend private schools
 
05:05:57.910 --> 05:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
rather than public schools
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
these private schools must meet minimum
 
05:06:02.390 --> 05:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
standards established by legislatures
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
and legislatures set parameters for
 
05:06:08.550 --> 05:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
student eligibility such as for families
 
05:06:11.830 --> 05:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
to meet a specific income threshold
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a lot more detail in
 
05:06:16.628 --> 05:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
rsa 194f about new hampshire's school
 
05:06:18.070 --> 05:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
voucher program
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
but it has these basic characteristics
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
well except for the private schools
 
05:06:25.270 --> 05:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
having to meet minimum standards
 
05:06:26.868 --> 05:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's voucher program doesn't
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
have that
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
did you know that in 1975 new hampshire
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
had a school voucher pilot program in
 
05:06:35.520 --> 05:06:36.830 align:start position:0%
had a school voucher pilot program in
rsa

05:06:36.830 --> 05:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
05:06:40.550 --> 05:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
194a in fact it's titled quote education
 
05:06:42.628 --> 05:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
voucher programs and it's similar to
 
05:06:44.948 --> 05:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
what the state enacted last summer
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
as part of the budget
 
05:06:48.948 --> 05:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
with a few noticeable differences
 
05:06:51.030 --> 05:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
school districts would not see a loss of
 
05:06:52.628 --> 05:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
state aid
 
05:06:54.550 --> 05:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
in fact the voucher was in addition to
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
this aid and not a substitution for it
 
05:06:59.670 --> 05:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
another difference is that the payment
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
would flow from the school district to
 
05:07:04.390 --> 05:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
the education service provider
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
and another big difference is the 1975
 
05:07:09.670 --> 05:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
law included a provision to repeal it
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
after eight years
 
05:07:12.868 --> 05:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
and guess what
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
it was repealed
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
so best i can tell the so-called
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
education freedom account program does
 
05:07:21.750 --> 05:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same as the voucher
 
05:07:21.760 --> 05:07:22.788 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same as the voucher
program

05:07:22.788 --> 05:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
it directs taxpayer money to pay for
 
05:07:26.868 --> 05:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
other people's private school tuition
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
and homeschool costs
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
but the new efa program doesn't set
 
05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
standards for participating private
 
05:07:33.360 --> 05:07:34.470 align:start position:0%
standards for participating private
schools

05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
it has a third party program
 
05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
administrator with a current and former
 
05:07:39.910 --> 05:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
state representative on their board that
 
05:07:42.390 --> 05:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
keeps 10 percent of taxpayer money
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have a repeal provision
 
05:07:48.550 --> 05:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
in the end the efa program is a voucher
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
program that lacks education standards
 
05:07:54.390 --> 05:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
accountability fraud protection
 
05:07:56.708 --> 05:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility income
 
05:07:59.110 --> 05:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements at least after
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
the first year
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
is potentially subject to federal income
 
05:08:02.638 --> 05:08:03.990 align:start position:0%
is potentially subject to federal income
tax

05:08:03.990 --> 05:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
tax
 
05:08:06.310 --> 05:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
is considered a parental placement under
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
and doesn't include repeal language
 
05:08:13.030 --> 05:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't think passing public money
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
through a third party that takes a 10
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
cut makes it any better especially in
 
05:08:19.590 --> 05:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
the eyes of taxpayers
 
05:08:21.430 --> 05:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
so words do matter
 
05:08:23.030 --> 05:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
what is clear is that new hampshire has
 
05:08:25.510 --> 05:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
a voucher program and a bad voucher
 
05:08:27.030 --> 05:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
program at that
 
05:08:29.110 --> 05:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
to try to call it something else is
 
05:08:31.510 --> 05:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
simply to recognize that granite staters
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
have rejected and continue to reject
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
voucher programs
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
the way the voucher program was hastily
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
jammed into the budget with no debate
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
with strong public opposition
 
05:08:45.990 --> 05:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
has resulted in a program that is
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
financially irresponsible and leaves
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
students and taxpayers susceptible to
 
05:08:53.110 --> 05:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
fraud and abuse
 
05:08:55.510 --> 05:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
at best it's about using taxpayer money
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
to pay for someone else's private school
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
tuition and home school costs
 
05:09:02.788 --> 05:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
at worst it's a blank check to pay for
 
05:09:04.788 --> 05:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
just about anything
 
05:09:07.350 --> 05:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
we've proposed a number of bills some
 
05:09:09.270 --> 05:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
with bipartisan support
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
to set up some guard rails to protect
 
05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
students and taxpayers
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
unless these bills move forward the only
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
responsible move
 
05:09:19.750 --> 05:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
is to repeal the program
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 1516
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
prohibits the use of local property
 
05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
taxes to fund school vouchers
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
it protects local taxpayers whose costs
 
05:09:31.270 --> 05:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
would range from a few thousand dollars
 
05:09:33.510 --> 05:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
per student to more than twenty thousand
 
05:09:36.628 --> 05:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
dollars depending upon where you live
 
05:09:37.990 --> 05:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
it will be on the house floor on
 
05:09:41.670 --> 05:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
wednesday for debate and vote
 
05:09:44.070 --> 05:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1684 holds the program to
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
budgeted amounts
 
05:09:47.110 --> 05:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
for this year at the request of the
 
05:09:49.590 --> 05:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
department of education the state budget
 
05:09:53.110 --> 05:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
included 129 000 for vouchers and it's
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
already blown the budget by more than
 
05:09:56.550 --> 05:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
before taking a voucher the vast
 
05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
majority of these students were already
 
05:10:02.788 --> 05:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
in private schools and home schools by
 
05:10:06.550 --> 05:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
their choice and at no cost to taxpayers
 
05:10:08.070 --> 05:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
according to the legislative budget
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
assistant office total taxpayer exposure
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
could exceed 70 million dollars just to
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
pay this private school tuition and home
 
05:10:17.590 --> 05:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
school costs
 
05:10:19.830 --> 05:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment to house bill 16
 
05:10:23.510 --> 05:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
1684 and we discussed it last week to
 
05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
accommodate students already in the
 
05:10:25.360 --> 05:10:26.948 align:start position:0%
accommodate students already in the
program

05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
this bill and amendment also come to the
 
05:10:30.550 --> 05:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
house floor tomorrow
 
05:10:32.550 --> 05:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
attempts to table these bills will be a
 
05:10:34.390 --> 05:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
clear signal to voters that
 
05:10:35.990 --> 05:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
representatives want to hide from a
 
05:10:39.910 --> 05:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
record of financial irresponsibility
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%

house bills 1355 and 1672
 
05:10:54.070 --> 05:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
require the contractor to report
 
05:10:56.550 --> 05:10:56.560 align:start position:0%

general for investigation
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
both these bills protects taxpayers and
 
05:11:02.948 --> 05:11:02.958 align:start position:0%

hospital 1376 makes it clear that under
 
05:11:09.270 --> 05:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
federal law a student within with an iep
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
waives their right to a free and

the bill doesn't change anybody's rights
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
it just makes it clear to parents what
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
they're signing up for
 
05:11:22.470 --> 05:11:22.480 align:start position:0%

05:11:24.708 --> 05:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
party contractor and puts the department
 
05:11:26.788 --> 05:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
of education in charge to administer the
 
05:11:26.798 --> 05:11:27.830 align:start position:0%
of education in charge to administer the
program

05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
this would increase the value to
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
students by 10 percent
 
05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
current law requires students come from
 
05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
household households under 300 of the
 
05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
federal poverty line
 
05:11:43.030 --> 05:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
but but only uh to qualify for that in
 
05:11:44.550 --> 05:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
the first year
 
05:11:46.310 --> 05:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
every year thereafter no income
 
05:11:48.708 --> 05:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
qualification would be necessary
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
senate bill 237
 
05:11:53.430 --> 05:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
requires annual income verification to
 
05:11:55.350 --> 05:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
participate in the program
 
05:11:57.750 --> 05:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that's not a big lift since families
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
already have to provide their tax
 
05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
returns to the program administrator
 
05:12:02.948 --> 05:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
every year
 
05:12:04.628 --> 05:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
so if we're not going to approve these
 
05:12:04.638 --> 05:12:05.510 align:start position:0%
so if we're not going to approve these
bills

05:12:05.510 --> 05:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
that protect taxpayers and students
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
and provide some degree of fiscal
 
05:12:12.230 --> 05:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility accountability and
 
05:12:15.190 --> 05:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
transparency then we have no choice but
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
to repeal the voucher program
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill house bill
 
05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
1683 does i'm happy to take questions
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:12:25.110 --> 05:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
questions of representative
 
05:12:26.628 --> 05:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative luna
 
05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
all as well
 
05:12:29.840 --> 05:12:31.670 align:start position:0%
all as well
um

05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:33.590 --> 05:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
are you familiar
 
05:12:35.350 --> 05:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
with the fact that there are differences
 
05:12:37.750 --> 05:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
between voucher programs and education
 
05:12:40.550 --> 05:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
savings accounts programs and that this
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
is an education savings account program
 
05:12:46.230 --> 05:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm i'm certainly uh familiar
 
05:12:48.550 --> 05:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
with um with voucher programs and
 
05:12:50.788 --> 05:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
education savings account programs and
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
the education freedom account program as
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's defined in in our statutes
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
um the fact of the matter is
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli is that um is
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
that our constituents don't want to
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
argue the difference on it they want to
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
argue they want to learn about what the
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
program is and not be told that it's
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
something that it isn't most granite
 
05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
staters are familiar with voucher
 
05:13:13.600 --> 05:13:14.708 align:start position:0%
staters are familiar with voucher
programs

05:13:14.708 --> 05:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
that have been enacted in other states
 
05:13:19.030 --> 05:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
and you're right this one is quite a bit
 
05:13:20.948 --> 05:13:20.958 align:start position:0%
different but i think in the eyes of a
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
lot of taxpayers those differences don't
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
make the program
 
05:13:27.190 --> 05:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
more exciting more enticing more
 
05:13:29.030 --> 05:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
valuable but in fact take it the other
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
way so calling it a voucher doesn't um
 
05:13:35.110 --> 05:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that fact follow-up
 
05:13:35.120 --> 05:13:36.470 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that fact follow-up
question

05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:13:38.550 --> 05:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the uh
 
05:13:40.400 --> 05:13:41.350 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the uh
10

05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
10
 
05:13:43.990 --> 05:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
um in the legislation to go to the
 
05:13:47.030 --> 05:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization or uh to
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
whatever organization has the contracts
 
05:13:54.150 --> 05:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
um for administration of 10
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
are you aware that uh
 
05:13:58.708 --> 05:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
per the
 
05:14:01.030 --> 05:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
reports that are sent to the department
 
05:14:03.510 --> 05:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
of education from the districts that
 
05:14:06.310 --> 05:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
school administration costs are also ten
 
05:14:08.550 --> 05:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
percent yeah i'm aware i'm aware of that
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
05:14:12.150 --> 05:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative um and so in the case
 
05:14:15.030 --> 05:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
where a um or a voucher is being used to
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
to pay private school tuition that
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
private school tuition covers the
 
05:14:20.310 --> 05:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
administrative costs of the private
 
05:14:22.868 --> 05:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
school so now we're essentially doubling
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
the the administrative costs associated
 
05:14:27.510 --> 05:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
with the adequacy dollars that are
 
05:14:30.070 --> 05:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
limited and come from the state and
 
05:14:32.948 --> 05:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
we've just made our adequacy dollars
 
05:14:35.910 --> 05:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
that much less efficient
 
05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
further questions representative moffatt
 
05:14:40.470 --> 05:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you miss you thank you taking my
 
05:14:40.480 --> 05:14:41.670 align:start position:0%
thank you miss you thank you taking my
question

05:14:41.670 --> 05:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned a couple times that
 
05:14:47.030 --> 05:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
the efa program
 
05:14:47.040 --> 05:14:48.390 align:start position:0%
the efa program
um

05:14:48.390 --> 05:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:50.948 --> 05:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
uses taxpayer money to pay for someone
 
05:14:53.110 --> 05:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
else's education you said that at least
 
05:14:55.590 --> 05:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of times but my question refers
 
05:14:55.600 --> 05:14:56.310 align:start position:0%
a couple of times but my question refers
to

05:14:56.310 --> 05:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
like don't almost all new hampshire
 
05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
families pay property taxes directly
 
05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
indirectly through
 
05:15:05.030 --> 05:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
rent or from their own properties and so
 
05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
if that's the case wouldn't these
 
05:15:08.788 --> 05:15:08.798 align:start position:0%
families have already
 
05:15:11.990 --> 05:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
put money into swept statewide education
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
property tax so thank you very much for
 
05:15:15.190 --> 05:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
the question
 
05:15:16.788 --> 05:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
what i said was to pay for somebody
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
else's private schooling
 
05:15:21.750 --> 05:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
tuition and home education costs so i
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
didn't just say pay for somebody else's
 
05:15:26.550 --> 05:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
education because all of our tax dollars
 
05:15:29.590 --> 05:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
do pay for public education we have a
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement in new
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire to provide a constitutionally
 
05:15:35.590 --> 05:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
adequate education to all new
 
05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire's children and the state of
 
05:15:40.868 --> 05:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has decided to do that
 
05:15:43.350 --> 05:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
through school districts if the state
 
05:15:45.670 --> 05:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
the state can certainly do other other
 
05:15:49.350 --> 05:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
things too but our obligation to pay for
 
05:15:52.470 --> 05:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
other people's education is through
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
public s through our school districts
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
for the constitutional requirement that
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:16:03.350 --> 05:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:05.190 --> 05:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just following up with what you just
 
05:16:07.270 --> 05:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
said didn't you say
 
05:16:10.788 --> 05:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
if the state decides to have other
 
05:16:12.550 --> 05:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
means of
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
providing that education we can and
 
05:16:17.910 --> 05:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
didn't we when we passed efas so now why
 
05:16:19.830 --> 05:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
are those students not supposed to be
 
05:16:22.390 --> 05:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
provided for an education if that was a
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
way we decided to adequately
 
05:16:28.150 --> 05:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
give an opportunity for f for education
 
05:16:29.910 --> 05:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for the for the
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
question representative lucas the um the
 
05:16:34.470 --> 05:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
state can provide alternatives if it
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
want and it can pay for them or not if
 
05:16:39.750 --> 05:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
it wants but it doesn't have that choice
 
05:16:41.830 --> 05:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
when it comes to school districts
 
05:16:43.910 --> 05:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
because the state provides its
 
05:16:46.230 --> 05:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry because the state
 
05:16:46.240 --> 05:16:47.430 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry because the state
um

05:16:47.430 --> 05:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:50.470 --> 05:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh performs its constitutional
 
05:16:52.230 --> 05:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
obligation for a constitutionally
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
adequate education through the school
 
05:16:55.990 --> 05:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
districts that are set up across the
 
05:16:56.000 --> 05:16:58.868 align:start position:0%
districts that are set up across the
state

05:16:58.868 --> 05:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:01.030 --> 05:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:17:04.390 --> 05:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
yes represent litchfield
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:17:05.760 --> 05:17:06.868 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
did you know by folks using the efa
 
05:17:11.110 --> 05:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
accounts that they are not taking any
 
05:17:13.590 --> 05:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
money away from public schools because
 
05:17:15.430 --> 05:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
if the child does not attend the public
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
school the state adequacy money does not
 
05:17:19.750 --> 05:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
go to the public school anyway
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
no thank you very much for the question
 
05:17:23.110 --> 05:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
i'm really familiar with with how school
 
05:17:24.390 --> 05:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
funding works
 
05:17:27.030 --> 05:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
in um in new hampshire and uh that is
 
05:17:30.070 --> 05:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely true for approximately the 17
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
of students who are enrolled in in the
 
05:17:34.708 --> 05:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
voucher program but for the vast
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
majority of of um
 
05:17:39.270 --> 05:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
of of students in the program they they
 
05:17:41.590 --> 05:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
did not end they did not exit their
 
05:17:44.708 --> 05:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
public school directly to uh to uh to
 
05:17:47.430 --> 05:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
enter the uh the efas so this is
 
05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
entirely new money on the part of the
 
05:17:51.670 --> 05:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
state and the
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
the 8 million or 8.1 million
 
05:17:56.470 --> 05:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
over budget
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
is is money that that the state was not
 
05:18:01.590 --> 05:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
spending on its public schools for these
 
05:18:01.600 --> 05:18:03.190 align:start position:0%
spending on its public schools for these
students

05:18:03.190 --> 05:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:18:04.628 --> 05:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative nelson thank you mr
 
05:18:07.750 --> 05:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:18:07.760 --> 05:18:08.708 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

05:18:08.708 --> 05:18:08.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:18:10.390 --> 05:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
seems like earlier today there was
 
05:18:12.310 --> 05:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
concern about students getting a very
 
05:18:14.948 --> 05:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
good education and some were not if a
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
parent felt that this was the way to go
 
05:18:19.030 --> 05:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
with these accounts
 
05:18:20.550 --> 05:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
for their child to get a better
 
05:18:23.270 --> 05:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
education why would we deny them that
 
05:18:23.280 --> 05:18:24.390 align:start position:0%
education why would we deny them that
right

05:18:24.390 --> 05:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:18:27.190 --> 05:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
so um so first of all they
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
parents have always had the right to um
 
05:18:32.310 --> 05:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
to to take their child out of public
 
05:18:34.550 --> 05:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
school and put them into alternative
 
05:18:36.628 --> 05:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
educational environments
 
05:18:39.590 --> 05:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
our statutes reflect that when looking
 
05:18:41.670 --> 05:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
at the um i forget the particular
 
05:18:44.230 --> 05:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
statute but that that you know students
 
05:18:45.590 --> 05:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be in school from i
 
05:18:48.150 --> 05:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
think age six to age eighteen
 
05:18:48.160 --> 05:18:49.030 align:start position:0%
think age six to age eighteen
uh

05:18:49.030 --> 05:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:51.670 --> 05:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
and um and and and uh you can you can
 
05:18:53.910 --> 05:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
meet that qualification by going to your
 
05:18:55.350 --> 05:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
public school or going to a private
 
05:18:56.550 --> 05:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
school or being homeschooled and i think
 
05:18:58.788 --> 05:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
there's a few other alternatives uh in
 
05:19:00.470 --> 05:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
there in there as well
 
05:19:03.750 --> 05:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
so so that right has has already uh been
 
05:19:05.910 --> 05:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
in existence i think where the question
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
is do taxpayers have the responsibility
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
to pay for those that public school
 
05:19:13.110 --> 05:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
tuition and for these homeschooling
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
costs when taxpayers are already
 
05:19:15.600 --> 05:19:17.270 align:start position:0%
costs when taxpayers are already
providing

05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
providing
 
05:19:19.990 --> 05:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
a constitutionally adequate education
 
05:19:21.590 --> 05:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
through school districts across the
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
state so that's a question for taxpayers
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's a policy question for the state the
 
05:19:29.590 --> 05:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
state has an obligation to fund its um
 
05:19:32.070 --> 05:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
to fund its school districts uh it does
 
05:19:34.470 --> 05:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
not have an obligation to fund these
 
05:19:36.788 --> 05:19:36.798 align:start position:0%
these private accounts
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
further questions represent lakas
 
05:19:42.150 --> 05:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i keep hearing that argument
 
05:19:44.550 --> 05:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
parents already have a right to take
 
05:19:46.708 --> 05:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
their kids out of the public schools
 
05:19:48.310 --> 05:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
but what about the parents who don't
 
05:19:50.310 --> 05:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
have the means to take their kids out of
 
05:19:52.628 --> 05:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
the public schools if the public school
 
05:19:55.270 --> 05:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
is not providing an adequate education
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
for a student
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
should a stu should the state since
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're not providing an adequate
 
05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
education should they not
 
05:20:06.390 --> 05:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
provide those means
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
and much smaller means
 
05:20:11.910 --> 05:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
for the parent to still be able to
 
05:20:14.310 --> 05:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
provide an education for their students
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
should only the rich be able to get a
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
good education you're always talking
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
about helping those poorer students
 
05:20:21.920 --> 05:20:22.708 align:start position:0%
about helping those poorer students
that's

05:20:22.708 --> 05:20:22.718 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
you you want to completely revamp the
 
05:20:27.350 --> 05:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
way school is funded to get take care of
 
05:20:29.350 --> 05:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
those poorest students well here's a way
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
to take care of the poorer students
 
05:20:35.590 --> 05:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
so so i've laid out a number of very
 
05:20:40.470 --> 05:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
specific reasons to
 
05:20:42.150 --> 05:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
um behind
 
05:20:45.910 --> 05:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
the rationale to repeal this program um
 
05:20:48.948 --> 05:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh particularly financial
 
05:20:51.670 --> 05:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
the financial irresponsibility of the
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
current program the lack of safeguards
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
for to protect students i've i've laid
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
all of all of these things out
 
05:20:59.280 --> 05:21:00.310 align:start position:0%
all of all of these things out
um

05:21:00.310 --> 05:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:00.320 --> 05:21:01.270 align:start position:0%
um
the

05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:21:03.590 --> 05:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
not taking away anybody's right to
 
05:21:06.788 --> 05:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
anything everybody has a right to attend
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
their um their public school
 
05:21:10.628 --> 05:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
through their through their local school
 
05:21:10.638 --> 05:21:11.830 align:start position:0%
through their through their local school
districts

05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
districts
 
05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
and and that's how new hampshire
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
provides a constitutionally adequate
 
05:21:17.190 --> 05:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
education we heard from the commissioner
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
this morning in his opinion that new
 
05:21:22.628 --> 05:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire is providing beyond more than
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
a constitutionally adequate education so
 
05:21:25.520 --> 05:21:26.548 align:start position:0%
a constitutionally adequate education so
um

05:21:26.548 --> 05:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:29.430 --> 05:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
so but but i think your question is um
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
is is is very important because if in
 
05:21:35.350 --> 05:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
fact new hampshire is failing to provide
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
a constitutionally adequate education
 
05:21:40.470 --> 05:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
then then it does set up new hampshire
 
05:21:42.548 --> 05:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
it sets up the question of what's new
 
05:21:47.190 --> 05:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:48.628 --> 05:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
05:21:51.110 --> 05:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you in terms of what is
 
05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire going to do about it
 
05:21:55.510 --> 05:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
what is new hampshire going to do about
 
05:21:56.868 --> 05:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
it if
 
05:22:00.150 --> 05:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
um a child in a public school is not
 
05:22:04.628 --> 05:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
having their educational needs met
 
05:22:06.708 --> 05:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there be alternatives for the
 
05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
parent in those cases and
 
05:22:12.628 --> 05:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
especially if those parents are not
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
wealthy and cannot afford on their own
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
to send their child to a to a private
 
05:22:17.760 --> 05:22:20.150 align:start position:0%
to send their child to a to a private
school

05:22:20.150 --> 05:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:21.510 --> 05:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:22:23.830 --> 05:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's uh that that's a
 
05:22:25.830 --> 05:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
an important question i mean every every
 
05:22:27.670 --> 05:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
public school
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
every school district i should say has a
 
05:22:32.548 --> 05:22:32.558 align:start position:0%
locally elected school board
 
05:22:34.628 --> 05:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
parents can can meet with their school
 
05:22:36.070 --> 05:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
board members
 
05:22:37.990 --> 05:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
as i met with school board members when
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
i was on a uh on a on a school board and
 
05:22:44.548 --> 05:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
try to
 
05:22:44.558 --> 05:22:45.590 align:start position:0%
try to
um

05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:47.430 --> 05:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
learn about what the uh what the parents
 
05:22:49.830 --> 05:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
concerns are and uh and take those
 
05:22:52.470 --> 05:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
concerns to the administration for um uh
 
05:22:53.910 --> 05:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
for resolution
 
05:22:55.910 --> 05:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think that's the way that's
 
05:22:57.270 --> 05:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
that's addressed given that new
 
05:22:59.110 --> 05:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire provides its constitutionally
 
05:22:59.120 --> 05:22:59.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire provides its constitutionally
adequate

05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
05:23:03.990 --> 05:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:23:07.430 --> 05:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
05:23:09.030 --> 05:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:23:09.040 --> 05:23:09.990 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:23:09.990 --> 05:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:23:13.190 --> 05:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
um do you feel that taxpayers have a
 
05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
right to
 
05:23:14.798 --> 05:23:15.910 align:start position:0%
right to
the

05:23:15.910 --> 05:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:23:18.868 --> 05:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
accountability some accountability
 
05:23:23.110 --> 05:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:25.510 --> 05:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
the academic achievement or academic
 
05:23:28.868 --> 05:23:28.878 align:start position:0%
services that are offered in in the efa
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
program the the voucher program and also
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
accountability for how the money's spent
 
05:23:36.548 --> 05:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
so thank you very very much for the
 
05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
question representative tanner um given
 
05:23:41.590 --> 05:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that that um
 
05:23:43.510 --> 05:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
that the money that's in the efa program
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
or the voucher program uh began with
 
05:23:49.030 --> 05:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
with taxpayer money then then i do think
 
05:23:50.708 --> 05:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have a vested interest in
 
05:23:53.430 --> 05:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
knowing how their money is being spent
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
how it's being used and what the results
 
05:23:57.910 --> 05:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
are from that use they do have that
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
information when it comes to school
 
05:24:02.070 --> 05:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
districts and all that information is
 
05:24:02.080 --> 05:24:03.430 align:start position:0%
districts and all that information is
available

05:24:03.430 --> 05:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:24:03.440 --> 05:24:04.548 align:start position:0%
available
through

05:24:04.548 --> 05:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:24:06.310 --> 05:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
through information that's collected by
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
the department and uh and student
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
performance data that's um that's
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
available so
 
05:24:15.270 --> 05:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
so it is available through
 
05:24:18.150 --> 05:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
for public for public schools it uh it
 
05:24:19.830 --> 05:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
certainly should be available for
 
05:24:21.510 --> 05:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
anything else that's funded by taxpayer
 
05:24:21.520 --> 05:24:23.030 align:start position:0%
anything else that's funded by taxpayer
dollars

05:24:23.030 --> 05:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative luna you and i have had
 
05:24:26.390 --> 05:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
this discussion many times so i ask you
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
this question again
 
05:24:28.080 --> 05:24:29.190 align:start position:0%
this question again
um

05:24:29.190 --> 05:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
you just responded that the taxpayers in
 
05:24:33.510 --> 05:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
the community should have accountability
 
05:24:33.520 --> 05:24:34.230 align:start position:0%
the community should have accountability
for

05:24:34.230 --> 05:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:24:37.110 --> 05:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
the results are for an efa program do
 
05:24:38.948 --> 05:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayers also have the right for
 
05:24:40.948 --> 05:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
accountability where we're having an
 
05:24:43.190 --> 05:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
average math score in the state a
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
proficiency of 38 percent
 
05:24:48.470 --> 05:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely i think
 
05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
i think accountability is taxpayer
 
05:24:54.548 --> 05:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
accountability is is absolutely uh a
 
05:24:57.910 --> 05:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
critical item um for for for anything
 
05:24:59.110 --> 05:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
05:24:59.120 --> 05:24:59.990 align:start position:0%
that's that's
uh

05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:25:03.190 --> 05:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
funded through taxpayer dollars now
 
05:25:05.110 --> 05:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
where you there's there's certainly a
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
lot of different measures as far as
 
05:25:10.230 --> 05:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
student performance um is concerned
 
05:25:11.670 --> 05:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:25:14.310 --> 05:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
and and you know the uh
 
05:25:17.430 --> 05:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's proficiency on on tests or
 
05:25:20.470 --> 05:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
sat scores or other factors too like
 
05:25:22.868 --> 05:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
graduation and attendance rates those
 
05:25:26.310 --> 05:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
are all important uh considerations too
 
05:25:28.868 --> 05:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
student outcomes um how successful are
 
05:25:33.750 --> 05:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
work whether that's
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
going into the workforce an
 
05:25:38.400 --> 05:25:39.670 align:start position:0%
going into the workforce an
apprenticeship

05:25:39.670 --> 05:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship
 
05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
post-secondary higher education or the
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
military how successful are our students
 
05:25:45.910 --> 05:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
after they uh after they leave their the
 
05:25:51.030 --> 05:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
k-12 world absolutely thank you
 
05:25:54.310 --> 05:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh further questions represent uh
 
05:25:56.708 --> 05:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
woodcock then representative cordelli
 
05:25:58.390 --> 05:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
05:25:59.670 --> 05:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
05:26:01.270 --> 05:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question well these hope thank
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
i've heard here today in prior dialogues
 
05:26:10.948 --> 05:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:15.670 --> 05:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
efas the vouchers the esa's whatever
 
05:26:18.868 --> 05:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
term you want to use for that money
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
is helping the poor kids and why
 
05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they have the same opportunity
 
05:26:25.430 --> 05:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
as the wealthy families
 
05:26:28.470 --> 05:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
so my question is would you characterize
 
05:26:31.270 --> 05:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
the other 170 000 students that are in
 
05:26:32.628 --> 05:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
public school coming from wealthy
 
05:26:32.638 --> 05:26:34.948 align:start position:0%
public school coming from wealthy
families

05:26:34.948 --> 05:26:34.958 align:start position:0%
families
 
05:26:37.350 --> 05:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
coming from what wealthy families oh
 
05:26:38.948 --> 05:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
sorry um
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
no i i would not characterize the um the
 
05:26:46.470 --> 05:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
the 160 000 ish students that that
 
05:26:49.430 --> 05:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
currently attend public schools as uh as
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
05:26:53.590 --> 05:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
coming from coming from wealthy families
 
05:26:55.590 --> 05:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
i think some probably do i think it's
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
probably all over all over the map
 
05:26:58.320 --> 05:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
probably all over all over the map
and

05:26:59.110 --> 05:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:01.910 --> 05:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
what what i'm what i'm really you know
 
05:27:04.150 --> 05:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
what i feel good about in new hampshire
 
05:27:06.150 --> 05:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
is that in general our public schools
 
05:27:08.470 --> 05:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
are are very good but as we heard this
 
05:27:09.910 --> 05:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
morning it's just not happening
 
05:27:13.110 --> 05:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
everywhere and the public schools that
 
05:27:14.230 --> 05:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
have the
 
05:27:15.910 --> 05:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
the greatest challenges
 
05:27:17.190 --> 05:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
where the average students are
 
05:27:17.200 --> 05:27:18.390 align:start position:0%
where the average students are
performing

05:27:18.390 --> 05:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
performing
 
05:27:21.190 --> 05:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
in the in the lower uh quartile tend to
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
be public schools that are serving a
 
05:27:27.510 --> 05:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
a less affluent
 
05:27:27.520 --> 05:27:28.788 align:start position:0%
a less affluent
population

05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
and and this is where i think the state
 
05:27:31.040 --> 05:27:31.910 align:start position:0%
and and this is where i think the state
can

05:27:31.910 --> 05:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:27:34.230 --> 05:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
can do a lot more to try to improve
 
05:27:37.030 --> 05:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
those those outcomes by directing its
 
05:27:38.548 --> 05:27:38.558 align:start position:0%
limited resources to where they're
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
needed most thank you thank you chairman
 
05:27:42.470 --> 05:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh representative
 
05:27:44.708 --> 05:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you
 
05:27:48.628 --> 05:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
on accountability uh in most industries
 
05:27:50.948 --> 05:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
with automobile dealerships grocery
 
05:27:53.590 --> 05:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
stores clothing stores
 
05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
you're really talking about customer
 
05:27:57.590 --> 05:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
accountability if
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
the store is not meeting the customer's
 
05:28:00.868 --> 05:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
needs they're going to go to another
 
05:28:00.878 --> 05:28:03.190 align:start position:0%
needs they're going to go to another
store

05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
store
 
05:28:06.310 --> 05:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
isn't it really similar with education
 
05:28:08.470 --> 05:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
in that um
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
there's there should be
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
the highest form of accountability is
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
customer accountability also maybe known
 
05:28:17.350 --> 05:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
as parent accountability and in a
 
05:28:19.590 --> 05:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
program like this if
 
05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
the education option that the parent is
 
05:28:25.510 --> 05:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
choosing with their efa funds
 
05:28:27.510 --> 05:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
is not satisfied
 
05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
with the education the child is getting
 
05:28:33.110 --> 05:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
they can take their money and go to a
 
05:28:35.430 --> 05:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
different education option
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
parent accountability wouldn't you say
 
05:28:39.670 --> 05:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
that is the best form of accountability
 
05:28:41.670 --> 05:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
so i think parents have had that option
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
for a long time to take their money and
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
use it for a private school or use it
 
05:28:46.868 --> 05:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
for home school
 
05:28:48.868 --> 05:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
or or you know any of the things that
 
05:28:51.670 --> 05:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
that fall into the list of alternatives
 
05:28:53.910 --> 05:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that we have laid out in our in
 
05:28:56.470 --> 05:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
our statute statute uh i think parents
 
05:28:58.628 --> 05:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
have always had that ability i think
 
05:29:01.270 --> 05:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
what uh what what what they have right
 
05:29:04.150 --> 05:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
now which i think is beyond what uh what
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
what most taxpayers expect is for is for
 
05:29:10.390 --> 05:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
us as taxpayers to have to pay not only
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
for public school districts for
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate education but
 
05:29:16.708 --> 05:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
also some additional overlay
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
to uh to provide other forms of
 
05:29:22.150 --> 05:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
of education i think that's that's
 
05:29:24.868 --> 05:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
asking more than what taxpayers are
 
05:29:27.670 --> 05:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily signed up for
 
05:29:29.190 --> 05:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
05:29:29.200 --> 05:29:31.190 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
committee

05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:29:33.990 --> 05:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
so would you say then that taxpayers are
 
05:29:41.510 --> 05:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
only planning on educating the people in
 
05:29:44.788 --> 05:29:44.798 align:start position:0%
their town who go to the public school
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
and they have no desire whatsoever to
 
05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
educate any child who can't get an
 
05:29:53.190 --> 05:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
education there and go someplace else i
 
05:29:53.200 --> 05:29:54.150 align:start position:0%
education there and go someplace else i
mean

05:29:54.150 --> 05:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
mean
 
05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
i pay taxes i've paid taxes for
 
05:29:59.830 --> 05:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
38 years in my town i have not had my
 
05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
kids go to that school for 38 years and
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
i think most taxpayers would say that
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
and isn't the idea to tax to
 
05:30:10.628 --> 05:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
get an education or provide an education
 
05:30:14.548 --> 05:30:14.558 align:start position:0%
for the students in the town which would
 
05:30:17.430 --> 05:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
include not just those who can go to the
 
05:30:19.750 --> 05:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
public school but those for whom the
 
05:30:21.990 --> 05:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
public school doesn't work so one of the
 
05:30:25.350 --> 05:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
reasons new hampshire has such a good
 
05:30:27.510 --> 05:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
has such good public schools and school
 
05:30:29.670 --> 05:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
districts is because school districts
 
05:30:32.390 --> 05:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
budge school district budgets go to the
 
05:30:32.400 --> 05:30:33.350 align:start position:0%
budge school district budgets go to the
voter

05:30:33.350 --> 05:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
voter
 
05:30:35.590 --> 05:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
at every year at annual school district
 
05:30:37.270 --> 05:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
meetings in most places i know
 
05:30:39.190 --> 05:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
manchester and the cities are a little
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
bit different and i get that
 
05:30:42.480 --> 05:30:43.270 align:start position:0%
bit different and i get that
but

05:30:43.270 --> 05:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:30:45.430 --> 05:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
but but
 
05:30:47.910 --> 05:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
most school districts most voters have a
 
05:30:49.990 --> 05:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
real high expectation in terms of
 
05:30:51.830 --> 05:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
student performance and want to make
 
05:30:53.430 --> 05:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
sure they're providing the best public
 
05:30:55.670 --> 05:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
education that they can that they can
 
05:30:58.230 --> 05:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
afford we see that all over the state we
 
05:31:00.548 --> 05:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
see it in affluent communities
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
with with very high property valuations
 
05:31:05.670 --> 05:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
and they might be lucky enough to have
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know an ocean or lake
 
05:31:09.350 --> 05:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
in their community and then we see it in
 
05:31:11.270 --> 05:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
communities that don't have high
 
05:31:14.070 --> 05:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
property valuations and struggle work
 
05:31:16.548 --> 05:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
really hard to raise the money to try to
 
05:31:18.868 --> 05:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
do as best they can for their students
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
so absolutely
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
voters across the state almost uniformly
 
05:31:27.590 --> 05:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
want to want to want to have strong
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
05:31:29.040 --> 05:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
public schools
and

05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
and being on a school board i certainly
 
05:31:35.590 --> 05:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know think of of public education
 
05:31:37.750 --> 05:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
as anything but
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
one size fits all
 
05:31:41.910 --> 05:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's a type of education
 
05:31:44.230 --> 05:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
that has to be everything for everybody
 
05:31:46.470 --> 05:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
because you've got so much diverse and
 
05:31:48.230 --> 05:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
unique needs
 
05:31:50.548 --> 05:31:50.558 align:start position:0%
and diverse student characteristics
 
05:31:54.230 --> 05:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
um uh that uh that that it's a it's an
 
05:31:54.240 --> 05:31:55.670 align:start position:0%
um uh that uh that that it's a it's an
unbelievably

05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
unbelievably
 
05:31:55.680 --> 05:31:56.470 align:start position:0%
unbelievably
uh

05:31:56.470 --> 05:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:31:59.750 --> 05:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
important and and challenging
 
05:31:59.760 --> 05:32:01.350 align:start position:0%
important and and challenging
um

05:32:01.350 --> 05:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
obligation on the part of public schools
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to be able to do that but i
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
think we're very fortunate here in new
 
05:32:09.430 --> 05:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire to have the support of
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of voters
 
05:32:14.310 --> 05:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to do absolutely the best we
 
05:32:16.948 --> 05:32:16.958 align:start position:0%
can and i think we've got an opportunity
 
05:32:18.948 --> 05:32:18.958 align:start position:0%
over the next few years
 
05:32:21.110 --> 05:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
to uh to make sure that
 
05:32:21.120 --> 05:32:21.990 align:start position:0%
to uh to make sure that
that

05:32:21.990 --> 05:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:25.270 --> 05:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
that that we can we can you know
 
05:32:27.270 --> 05:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know tilt the bar
 
05:32:29.430 --> 05:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
so that uh so that
 
05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
students all across the state no matter
 
05:32:33.030 --> 05:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
where they live no matter what their zip
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
code is
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
can uh can have a strong opportunity for
 
05:32:38.708 --> 05:32:38.718 align:start position:0%
a good outcome
 
05:32:40.470 --> 05:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my questions
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
05:32:44.788 --> 05:32:44.798 align:start position:0%
questions representing tanner
 
05:32:46.390 --> 05:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:32:48.708 --> 05:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
do you think that taxpayers also are
 
05:32:51.510 --> 05:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
willing to pay money for
 
05:32:54.310 --> 05:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
public education because of the consumer
 
05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
protections and the safety nets
 
05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
that our community public schools offer
 
05:33:00.868 --> 05:33:00.878 align:start position:0%
students in our area
 
05:33:02.070 --> 05:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think
 
05:33:04.230 --> 05:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
05:33:05.430 --> 05:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
i i would say that that's just a given
 
05:33:10.548 --> 05:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
that's expected and uh and that there's
 
05:33:13.510 --> 05:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
certainly an accountability aspect to
 
05:33:15.750 --> 05:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
that but it's absolutely a consumer
 
05:33:18.150 --> 05:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
protection aspect that i know when when
 
05:33:20.628 --> 05:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
a public school hires teachers that
 
05:33:22.708 --> 05:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
these teachers are have been licensed
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
through the uh through the state board
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
of education i know that when the school
 
05:33:30.628 --> 05:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
district hires a contractor um that that
 
05:33:32.470 --> 05:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
they've undergone criminal background
 
05:33:35.830 --> 05:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
checks that that i know that when i send
 
05:33:37.910 --> 05:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
my child to a public school in the
 
05:33:40.948 --> 05:33:40.958 align:start position:0%
morning it's um it's on a school bus
 
05:33:43.750 --> 05:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
that that meets specific requirements
 
05:33:45.830 --> 05:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
for uh for public safety and when they
 
05:33:47.590 --> 05:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
walk into the school building they're
 
05:33:49.110 --> 05:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
not walking into a place that's going to
 
05:33:51.030 --> 05:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
have the roof collapse on their heads
 
05:33:53.350 --> 05:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
but it's something that's been inspected
 
05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
by the local building inspector on an
 
05:33:57.990 --> 05:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
annual basis and then also every year by
 
05:34:00.150 --> 05:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
the joint loss
 
05:34:00.160 --> 05:34:02.948 align:start position:0%
the joint loss
committee

05:34:02.948 --> 05:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to to make sure those
 
05:34:07.830 --> 05:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
buildings are safe so absolutely i think
 
05:34:10.548 --> 05:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
that's expected
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to call it quits on this
 
05:34:13.590 --> 05:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
one right here
 
05:34:15.030 --> 05:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's been 30 minutes with
 
05:34:17.990 --> 05:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative taking questions and
 
05:34:20.548 --> 05:34:20.558 align:start position:0%

all the very thoughtful uh questions
 
05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's this is an important issue
 
05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
obviously we went beyond i think um um
 
05:34:31.520 --> 05:34:32.548 align:start position:0%
obviously we went beyond i think um um

horrigan
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
this morning earlier we were looking at
 
05:34:49.430 --> 05:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
the content of an adequate education and
 
05:34:51.830 --> 05:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
looking at those learning domains and i
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
think after looking the cards one of the
 
05:34:54.628 --> 05:34:54.638 align:start position:0%
areas i'm going to put back in is
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
cursive writing
 
05:34:59.750 --> 05:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
and and manuscript uh penmanship
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
for some of you
 
05:35:03.750 --> 05:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:05.110 --> 05:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's a real battle up here trying to
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
05:35:09.670 --> 05:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
welcome representative welcome can you
 
05:35:11.430 --> 05:35:11.440 align:start position:0%

05:35:13.030 --> 05:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
horrigan from stratford county district
 
05:35:14.708 --> 05:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
six that's the towns of durham and
 
05:35:15.990 --> 05:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
madbury it's
 
05:35:17.430 --> 05:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the oyster river
 
05:35:20.150 --> 05:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district and i'm a
 
05:35:22.230 --> 05:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
proud former student of that cooperative
 
05:35:24.548 --> 05:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
school district i think they're
 
05:35:25.990 --> 05:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
back in retrospect i went to several
 
05:35:27.910 --> 05:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
different types of school a non-secular
 
05:35:29.190 --> 05:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
private school they religiously
 
05:35:29.200 --> 05:35:30.230 align:start position:0%
private school they religiously
connected

05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
connected
 
05:35:32.150 --> 05:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
private school
 
05:35:33.910 --> 05:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the conventional public school and
 
05:35:35.430 --> 05:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
also one year for a
 
05:35:37.990 --> 05:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
state school in uh in britain when my
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
dad was a
 
05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
visiting professor in england but anyway
 
05:35:43.270 --> 05:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
i think the uh
 
05:35:45.190 --> 05:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
the education i got in the conventional
 
05:35:46.628 --> 05:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
public school we like to dump on them
 
05:35:48.150 --> 05:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
but it was probably of all those
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
institutions that was probably where i
 
05:35:51.270 --> 05:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
learned the most in the oyster river
 
05:35:54.708 --> 05:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district so that's uh
 
05:35:55.990 --> 05:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:35:58.470 --> 05:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
so i remember my dad
 
05:36:00.070 --> 05:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
my late father who is a professor of
 
05:36:01.750 --> 05:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
accounting at unh and he certainly would
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
object to calling
 
05:36:05.110 --> 05:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
those voucher programs educational
 
05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
savings accounts because they're
 
05:36:06.240 --> 05:36:07.590 align:start position:0%
savings accounts because they're
absolutely

05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
not savings accounts at all um
 
05:36:13.510 --> 05:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
i remember the voucher bill
 
05:36:15.430 --> 05:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
that regina luna talked about i vaguely
 
05:36:17.670 --> 05:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
remember that from when he was a uh
 
05:36:19.510 --> 05:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
he was a rep so this issue that's been
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
bounced around for a long time and i see
 
05:36:21.600 --> 05:36:22.470 align:start position:0%
bounced around for a long time and i see
there's

05:36:22.470 --> 05:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:36:23.910 --> 05:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
a number of children are taking the day
 
05:36:25.510 --> 05:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
off from school to at least the
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon off to watch proceedings um
 
05:36:31.030 --> 05:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
i was 17 when my dad was first in
 
05:36:33.030 --> 05:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislature our next door neighbor we
 
05:36:34.948 --> 05:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
were very close to was my father's
 
05:36:36.788 --> 05:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
predecessor and my father took us down
 
05:36:38.230 --> 05:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
to see representative
 
05:36:40.310 --> 05:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
leon crouch in action a few times so it
 
05:36:41.750 --> 05:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
was a valuable learning experience i'm
 
05:36:43.510 --> 05:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
glad to hear maybe some of those
 
05:36:45.190 --> 05:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
children will someday be members of this
 
05:36:47.430 --> 05:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
body so
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
that said um
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
that said i think you don't have to look
 
05:36:52.470 --> 05:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
i think just pronounce your fiasco you
 
05:36:53.830 --> 05:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
don't really have to look much farther
 
05:36:55.270 --> 05:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
than the children's scholarship funds
 
05:36:57.030 --> 05:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's website to see why it's
 
05:36:59.590 --> 05:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
a fiasco and i i'm not
 
05:37:00.868 --> 05:37:00.878 align:start position:0%
don't want to impugn their integrity
 
05:37:02.230 --> 05:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
they're an honorable group of people
 
05:37:03.990 --> 05:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
they do a pretty good job of registering
 
05:37:07.110 --> 05:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
the rsa 77g program but
 
05:37:08.788 --> 05:37:08.798 align:start position:0%
they're a small and obscure politically
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
well-connected organization they were
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
awarded a no-bid contract being charged
 
05:37:14.948 --> 05:37:14.958 align:start position:0%
with a very ill-conceived and poorly
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
designed entitlement program which uh
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
and of course uh
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
you probably all remember how uh state
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner frank edelblut predicted
 
05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
not long ago about 28 children would
 
05:37:27.510 --> 05:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the efa program this
 
05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
school year
 
05:37:31.910 --> 05:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
the cfs h's website states and i
 
05:37:34.510 --> 05:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe them that eight
 
05:37:36.788 --> 05:37:36.798 align:start position:0%
1856 children are currently enrolled in
 
05:37:38.310 --> 05:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
the program so
 
05:37:39.750 --> 05:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioners
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
estimate was off by a factor of 60. so
 
05:37:43.510 --> 05:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
this program is programmed six thousand
 
05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
percent over budget so that's pretty
 
05:37:48.470 --> 05:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
alarming right there the uh
 
05:37:51.190 --> 05:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
the doe has very limited uh oversight
 
05:37:52.628 --> 05:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
over this aside from some rather
 
05:37:56.390 --> 05:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
rudimentary rules over csf nh
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
cfa nh um
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
i mean there's good people running the
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
organization but uh they just get a
 
05:38:03.590 --> 05:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
fixed percentage of taxpayer money to
 
05:38:05.110 --> 05:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
spend so they really have no incentive
 
05:38:06.788 --> 05:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
to you know reign in the costs of this
 
05:38:08.948 --> 05:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
program and they also have
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
really no incentive to ride her too hard
 
05:38:12.470 --> 05:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
on either families or educational
 
05:38:12.480 --> 05:38:13.910 align:start position:0%
on either families or educational
providers

05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:38:15.030 --> 05:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
i mean there are some rules the
 
05:38:16.548 --> 05:38:16.558 align:start position:0%
educational providers there are some
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
things you can't
 
05:38:20.070 --> 05:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
in fact it's um i guess anytime you make
 
05:38:21.270 --> 05:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
rules like that whereas a government
 
05:38:23.430 --> 05:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
non-government organization sometimes
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
what's in and what's out is kind of
 
05:38:26.230 --> 05:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
funny like we have
 
05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
school uniforms can be bought with efa
 
05:38:29.830 --> 05:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
funds but not
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
sports teams uniforms and you can't buy
 
05:38:33.670 --> 05:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
any type of shoes even though i think
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
every school that has a school uniform
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
has some rules about what shoes you can
 
05:38:39.270 --> 05:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
wear with it so there's a lot of
 
05:38:39.280 --> 05:38:40.070 align:start position:0%
wear with it so there's a lot of
um

05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
i mean that's probably true if any
 
05:38:43.030 --> 05:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
program is arbitrary but there isn't a
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
whole lot of outside uh oversight over
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
this organization so we're pretty much
 
05:38:49.110 --> 05:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
at their mercy and
 
05:38:51.510 --> 05:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
but a bigger problem is um separation of
 
05:38:53.350 --> 05:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
church and state is mandated by both the
 
05:38:55.590 --> 05:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire united states constitution
 
05:38:57.590 --> 05:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
our constitution and their statute law
 
05:38:58.948 --> 05:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
to go with it
 
05:39:01.110 --> 05:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
very specifically bans taxpayer funding
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
of religious schools and that's a i know
 
05:39:05.110 --> 05:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
we've debated that issue in the house
 
05:39:06.628 --> 05:39:06.638 align:start position:0%
because i was
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
testifying against a hearing uh trying
 
05:39:09.750 --> 05:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
to eliminate that but
 
05:39:11.830 --> 05:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
um part
 
05:39:14.948 --> 05:39:14.958 align:start position:0%
and part 83 parts article 83 part second
 
05:39:17.110 --> 05:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
of the state constitution states in part
 
05:39:18.390 --> 05:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
very clearly
 
05:39:20.310 --> 05:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
no money raised by taxation shall ever
 
05:39:22.788 --> 05:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
be granted or applied for the use of the
 
05:39:22.798 --> 05:39:24.310 align:start position:0%
be granted or applied for the use of the
schools

05:39:24.310 --> 05:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:39:26.628 --> 05:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
or institutions of any religious sector
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
denominations that's a pretty that's
 
05:39:30.708 --> 05:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
pretty unambiguous language it's been
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
there since the 19th century
 
05:39:36.470 --> 05:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
and with csf on the other hand and
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
they're very specifically quite openly
 
05:39:39.750 --> 05:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
devoted to make no bones about it
 
05:39:39.760 --> 05:39:40.548 align:start position:0%
devoted to make no bones about it
they're

05:39:40.548 --> 05:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:39:43.110 --> 05:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
devoted to promoting religious education
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
you need to look no forward than other
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
glossy reports always have pictures of
 
05:39:48.470 --> 05:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
parochial school students on and we need
 
05:39:49.750 --> 05:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
to look for it in the home page where
 
05:39:51.750 --> 05:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
they're very large very lovely portrait
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
very adorable very beautiful uh
 
05:39:55.270 --> 05:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
sisters they
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
appear to be aged about
 
05:39:58.708 --> 05:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
so they seem to be aged about eight
 
05:40:00.628 --> 05:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
years old nine years old plus or minus a
 
05:40:03.030 --> 05:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
couple of years um
 
05:40:04.548 --> 05:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
they're students at a manchester
 
05:40:06.230 --> 05:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
parochial school they're wearing school
 
05:40:08.470 --> 05:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
uniforms those could quite i say very
 
05:40:10.390 --> 05:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
likely in my written testimony but they
 
05:40:12.470 --> 05:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
could conceivably been purchased
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
with efa dollars
 
05:40:16.390 --> 05:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
and of course as you all know uh regular
 
05:40:17.830 --> 05:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
public school students their families
 
05:40:19.270 --> 05:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
have to buy all their own clothes so
 
05:40:20.708 --> 05:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
like the state doesn't buy them any
 
05:40:20.718 --> 05:40:22.548 align:start position:0%
like the state doesn't buy them any
outfits

05:40:22.548 --> 05:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
outfits
 
05:40:24.070 --> 05:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
and then these pictures also come with
 
05:40:25.990 --> 05:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
video the girls parents their older
 
05:40:27.910 --> 05:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
sisters and a local multi-millionaire
 
05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
all expand upon the awesomeness of
 
05:40:31.350 --> 05:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
private schools and the horribleness of
 
05:40:33.670 --> 05:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
05:40:35.430 --> 05:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm not a lawyer or a constitutional
 
05:40:38.070 --> 05:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
scholar and you know and i don't blame
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
cfs senate for doing what it is i think
 
05:40:41.190 --> 05:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
they're acting in good faith they're
 
05:40:42.868 --> 05:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the opportunities we
 
05:40:44.548 --> 05:40:44.558 align:start position:0%
gave them but
 
05:40:47.190 --> 05:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
cfna csf and his activities have never
 
05:40:48.628 --> 05:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
been seriously challenged the state of
 
05:40:50.310 --> 05:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
federal court but it's unclear to me how
 
05:40:51.430 --> 05:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
they can do what they do without
 
05:40:53.430 --> 05:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
violating article 83 part second of the
 
05:40:55.350 --> 05:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
state constitution because they're very
 
05:40:58.310 --> 05:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
clearly collecting taxpayer money and
 
05:41:00.390 --> 05:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
distributing it like pretty directly to
 
05:41:02.548 --> 05:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
parochial schools i know it's not just
 
05:41:03.990 --> 05:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
religious schools but that's like a
 
05:41:08.788 --> 05:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:10.150 --> 05:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
anyway there's a lot of other things i
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
can say about the uh what's wrong with
 
05:41:14.548 --> 05:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
the efa program but i just i think it's
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
wasteful it's unconstitutional it's
 
05:41:18.230 --> 05:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
poorly conceived
 
05:41:19.910 --> 05:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
so the first step in
 
05:41:21.750 --> 05:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
putting an end to this
 
05:41:25.030 --> 05:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
wasteful program is by passing hp 1683.
 
05:41:27.190 --> 05:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to find it ought to pass
 
05:41:27.200 --> 05:41:28.708 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to find it ought to pass
and

05:41:28.708 --> 05:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:28.718 --> 05:41:29.590 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:41:29.590 --> 05:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:31.110 --> 05:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
one thing you might mention i was just
 
05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
looking uh at the eligibility guidelines
 
05:41:35.830 --> 05:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
by the way the 300 percent of
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
federal poverty you're not rich but
 
05:41:39.990 --> 05:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
you're you can be doing pretty well and
 
05:41:41.430 --> 05:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
still meet especially if you have many
 
05:41:44.230 --> 05:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
children like i think even
 
05:41:46.230 --> 05:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
my family back in the 1960s that this
 
05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
program existed back then i'm pretty
 
05:41:48.000 --> 05:41:48.708 align:start position:0%
program existed back then i'm pretty
sure

05:41:48.708 --> 05:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
just trying to remember what i remember
 
05:41:52.150 --> 05:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
my dad telling me to multiply by
 
05:41:53.350 --> 05:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
donation i'm pretty sure at least when
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
my father came here as a
 
05:41:55.200 --> 05:41:55.910 align:start position:0%
my father came here as a
uh

05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:41:55.920 --> 05:41:56.788 align:start position:0%
uh
young

05:41:56.788 --> 05:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
young
 
05:41:59.270 --> 05:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
young associate professor
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
first he's a young assistant professor
 
05:42:03.030 --> 05:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
at uh what was in the whitmore school i
 
05:42:03.040 --> 05:42:04.150 align:start position:0%
at uh what was in the whitmore school i
think

05:42:04.150 --> 05:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:42:05.830 --> 05:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
i think my two sisters and i would have
 
05:42:07.670 --> 05:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
been eligible for this program and we um
 
05:42:09.350 --> 05:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know we were
 
05:42:10.948 --> 05:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
our family was much more fortunate than
 
05:42:12.310 --> 05:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
most we were blessed with a lot of good
 
05:42:14.628 --> 05:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
fortune and we did pretty well without
 
05:42:14.638 --> 05:42:15.670 align:start position:0%
fortune and we did pretty well without
uh

05:42:15.670 --> 05:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:42:17.830 --> 05:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
any efa or voucher whatever you call it
 
05:42:19.270 --> 05:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
so it's a fairly
 
05:42:20.948 --> 05:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
generous program the family the video
 
05:42:20.958 --> 05:42:21.830 align:start position:0%
generous program the family the video
had

05:42:21.830 --> 05:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:42:23.670 --> 05:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
five children they had a
 
05:42:25.750 --> 05:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
family of seven they could have uh made
 
05:42:26.788 --> 05:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
up to i think
 
05:42:27.990 --> 05:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
something like a hundred and twenty
 
05:42:29.270 --> 05:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars so they could
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
have made you know that didn't come to
 
05:42:32.310 --> 05:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
tie above what most working families
 
05:42:35.110 --> 05:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
make so um
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not just rich so you know
 
05:42:39.750 --> 05:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's a you can be actually doing pretty
 
05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
well for yourself and still be eligible
 
05:42:43.750 --> 05:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
for this program so
 
05:42:45.670 --> 05:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
if you have to take any questions
 
05:42:47.430 --> 05:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions of the
 
05:42:47.440 --> 05:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions of the
representative

05:42:49.910 --> 05:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:52.868 --> 05:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent litchfield
 
05:42:54.470 --> 05:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:42:54.480 --> 05:42:55.750 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:42:55.750 --> 05:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:42:57.750 --> 05:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
um first i just want to say wouldn't you
 
05:42:59.750 --> 05:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
agree that due to this program's
 
05:43:02.470 --> 05:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
popularity initially that parents really
 
05:43:05.190 --> 05:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
are hungry for this and there is a need
 
05:43:07.590 --> 05:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
and i also like to ask
 
05:43:09.910 --> 05:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
do you feel that possibly parents are
 
05:43:12.070 --> 05:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
being forced to leave public schools at
 
05:43:13.910 --> 05:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
this point in time maybe they're feeling
 
05:43:16.150 --> 05:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
as though they're not being heard by
 
05:43:18.310 --> 05:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
their school boards due to possibly
 
05:43:19.910 --> 05:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
forced masking
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
fear of cobalt vaccine mandates
 
05:43:25.830 --> 05:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
and being labeled nationally as domestic
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
terrorists well um
 
05:43:32.150 --> 05:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not i don't just i'm not sure who's
 
05:43:33.750 --> 05:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
being labeled domestic terrorists
 
05:43:35.590 --> 05:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
although we do have we do have
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
terrorists here in the united states um
 
05:43:37.440 --> 05:43:38.390 align:start position:0%
terrorists here in the united states um
that

05:43:38.390 --> 05:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:43:38.400 --> 05:43:39.270 align:start position:0%
that
the

05:43:39.270 --> 05:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:43:41.110 --> 05:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
of course there's also no protections
 
05:43:43.110 --> 05:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
program you know efa funds can go to
 
05:43:45.350 --> 05:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
organizations that forbid mess and the
 
05:43:45.360 --> 05:43:46.230 align:start position:0%
organizations that forbid mess and the
the

05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:43:48.788 --> 05:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
cause of it i think it's mostly uh
 
05:43:50.390 --> 05:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to be mostly taken advantage of
 
05:43:53.350 --> 05:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
by families who already would have found
 
05:43:54.948 --> 05:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
another way to go to a private school
 
05:43:56.830 --> 05:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
instead of their public school that's
 
05:43:59.670 --> 05:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's what the data i've seen suggest
 
05:44:01.910 --> 05:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
and i i don't buy that
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
public schools are unresponsive the uh
 
05:44:05.590 --> 05:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
so when i was attending the oyster river
 
05:44:05.600 --> 05:44:06.470 align:start position:0%
so when i was attending the oyster river
uh

05:44:06.470 --> 05:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
schools um of course my mom and dad were
 
05:44:10.310 --> 05:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
both big you know
 
05:44:11.830 --> 05:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
very persistent and it could be a big
 
05:44:13.270 --> 05:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
pain in the well i don't want to say
 
05:44:14.708 --> 05:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
that here but the big pain and you know
 
05:44:16.948 --> 05:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
what um but i
 
05:44:19.030 --> 05:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
i don't recall that the uh i don't
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
recall my school and that was a long
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
time ago being unresponsive to parents
 
05:44:24.390 --> 05:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
needs and i don't
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
think they're unresponsive now as for
 
05:44:28.070 --> 05:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
the masking um you know that's a
 
05:44:30.150 --> 05:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
controversial thing but
 
05:44:31.350 --> 05:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's a safety precaution that's
 
05:44:35.030 --> 05:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
just being imposed because we have a
 
05:44:37.830 --> 05:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic which presumably will
 
05:44:39.110 --> 05:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
settle down eventually i don't think
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's done so yet and uh
 
05:44:42.868 --> 05:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
and as
 
05:44:43.990 --> 05:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
for school boards you know they don't
 
05:44:45.830 --> 05:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
really provide the education it's the uh
 
05:44:48.230 --> 05:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
teachers and so a good school board
 
05:44:50.150 --> 05:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
should probably go unnoticed they should
 
05:44:51.430 --> 05:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
should be just doing their job without
 
05:44:52.948 --> 05:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
doing anything that attracts attention
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
so it's not really
 
05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
in fact probably if you have a specific
 
05:44:57.670 --> 05:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
complaint about your child that's
 
05:44:59.430 --> 05:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
probably not necessarily the first
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
person you want to talk to is your
 
05:45:01.910 --> 05:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
school board members you probably want
 
05:45:01.920 --> 05:45:03.270 align:start position:0%
school board members you probably want
to

05:45:03.270 --> 05:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:45:05.030 --> 05:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
talk to your teacher and your administ
 
05:45:06.708 --> 05:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
and the principal your school and so
 
05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
forth and i certainly uh don't feel i
 
05:45:09.750 --> 05:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
know that the
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent and the principals in the
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
oyster river schools are very responsive
 
05:45:15.270 --> 05:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
to the families like sir thank you very
 
05:45:17.110 --> 05:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
much representative are there further
 
05:45:17.120 --> 05:45:18.868 align:start position:0%
much representative are there further
questions

05:45:18.868 --> 05:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:45:20.470 --> 05:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
maxine thank you very much all right
 
05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:29.830 --> 05:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
hi everybody i'm kate baker demers i'm
 
05:45:31.190 --> 05:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
the executive director of children's
 
05:45:33.510 --> 05:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund and we have quite a few
 
05:45:35.270 --> 05:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
families in the education freedom
 
05:45:36.470 --> 05:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
account program
 
05:45:38.470 --> 05:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
that are homeschooling now medically
 
05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
fragile child children and so i'd like
 
05:45:43.350 --> 05:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
to read a testimony from a parent who
 
05:45:45.510 --> 05:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today
 
05:45:47.270 --> 05:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
she says i'm disheartened to see the
 
05:45:48.788 --> 05:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
efforts of some of our new hampshire
 
05:45:51.190 --> 05:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
leaders to eliminate the beneficial
 
05:45:53.750 --> 05:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
education freedom account program i'm a
 
05:45:55.350 --> 05:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
licensed teacher in the state of new
 
05:45:57.430 --> 05:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire and after having children of
 
05:45:59.190 --> 05:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
my own decided it was in their best
 
05:46:00.548 --> 05:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
interest to have an alternative
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
education path
 
05:46:04.390 --> 05:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
just as adults have a variety of skill
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
sets that lend themselves to various
 
05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
careers so children have different
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
learning styles
 
05:46:11.190 --> 05:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
parents know their children best and
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
therefore should be able to educate them
 
05:46:15.110 --> 05:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the environment that's most conducive
 
05:46:17.430 --> 05:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
to their individual learning styles
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
the dollars allocated for a child's
 
05:46:21.830 --> 05:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
education should therefore be able to
 
05:46:24.548 --> 05:46:24.558 align:start position:0%
follow each individual student so they
 
05:46:26.708 --> 05:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
have the best opportunities to learn in
 
05:46:28.948 --> 05:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
the most effective manner
 
05:46:30.470 --> 05:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
each of our children have been able to
 
05:46:32.230 --> 05:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
more fully reach their potential by
 
05:46:34.150 --> 05:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
having the resources made available to
 
05:46:36.150 --> 05:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
them that were intended for them in the
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
first place but never accessible until
 
05:46:40.150 --> 05:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
the education freedom account was
 
05:46:40.160 --> 05:46:41.670 align:start position:0%
the education freedom account was
established

05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
established
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's common sense to allow education tax
 
05:46:45.990 --> 05:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to follow a student that they
 
05:46:47.830 --> 05:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
were meant for rather than being
 
05:46:50.788 --> 05:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
educated allocated only to a building
 
05:46:53.110 --> 05:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
removing the efa program will not only
 
05:46:55.110 --> 05:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the participating
 
05:46:57.190 --> 05:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
families but also the children that
 
05:46:59.910 --> 05:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
would join the program in the future
 
05:47:02.070 --> 05:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
children thrive with consistency and
 
05:47:03.910 --> 05:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
bouncing them around by removing the
 
05:47:05.990 --> 05:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
funds that are meant for their schooling
 
05:47:07.590 --> 05:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
creates gaps in their learning that's
 
05:47:10.548 --> 05:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
both disruptive and detrimental to their
 
05:47:12.230 --> 05:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
overall education
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
it's a parent's right and responsibility
 
05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
to choose an education that best meets
 
05:47:19.430 --> 05:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
their child's needs education funding in
 
05:47:21.030 --> 05:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire should align with that
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
fact education freedom accounts should
 
05:47:25.750 --> 05:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
be the standard not just this year or
 
05:47:27.990 --> 05:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
next but as long as we are the live free
 
05:47:29.430 --> 05:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
or die state
 
05:47:31.350 --> 05:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
a vote to end the education freedom
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
account is a vote against the children
 
05:47:36.230 --> 05:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
of this state they are our future and
 
05:47:38.070 --> 05:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
deserve a learning environment in which
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
they thrive
 
05:47:42.230 --> 05:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
her name is karen dyer she's from alton
 
05:47:43.670 --> 05:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:47:45.910 --> 05:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
so you may have thought that while you
 
05:47:47.670 --> 05:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
were looking at this bill
 
05:47:50.070 --> 05:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
you were just looking at words on a page
 
05:47:51.670 --> 05:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
or that you were just crossing off a
 
05:47:53.750 --> 05:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
line here some of the bills you've been
 
05:47:55.990 --> 05:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
looking at maybe adding a tweak or you
 
05:47:58.070 --> 05:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
thought you're adding maybe a guard rail
 
05:48:01.030 --> 05:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
or eliminating a choice of what
 
05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
standardized test a parent might take or
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
adding a little bit of paperwork or
 
05:48:07.670 --> 05:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
maybe you're just enabling the
 
05:48:10.788 --> 05:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization or perhaps you
 
05:48:11.990 --> 05:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
were just thinking that one of these
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
bills just excluded some education
 
05:48:14.638 --> 05:48:15.910 align:start position:0%
bills just excluded some education
providers

05:48:15.910 --> 05:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:48:17.510 --> 05:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
and what i'd just like to share with you
 
05:48:20.070 --> 05:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
today is that when you do this
 
05:48:23.270 --> 05:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
when you change lines in a law
 
05:48:26.548 --> 05:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
change words add paragraphs cross off
 
05:48:28.948 --> 05:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
paragraphs in the education freedom
 
05:48:31.750 --> 05:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
account law you are in fact making it
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
inaccessible bureaucratic eliminating
 
05:48:36.868 --> 05:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
education options or frankly adding a
 
05:48:39.510 --> 05:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph that eliminates the program
 
05:48:42.548 --> 05:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
when you cross out these lines or words
 
05:48:44.470 --> 05:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
in the education freedom account law you
 
05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
are in fact crossing out real children
 
05:48:49.590 --> 05:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
real children in need possibly even the
 
05:48:52.948 --> 05:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
tutor that helps them with dyslexia
 
05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
i haven't been asked yet
 
05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
by anyone if there are any changes that
 
05:48:59.910 --> 05:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
we need at children's scholarship fund
 
05:49:02.230 --> 05:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
to run the program well
 
05:49:03.670 --> 05:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
the answer i would give you today is
 
05:49:03.680 --> 05:49:05.110 align:start position:0%
the answer i would give you today is
none

05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
none
 
05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
we will absolutely let you know when we
 
05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
do need something
 
05:49:11.510 --> 05:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
we are especially against working with
 
05:49:14.788 --> 05:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
the urgency of emts to get the program
 
05:49:16.390 --> 05:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
up and running in the fall
 
05:49:18.788 --> 05:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
and then by winter throwing out every
 
05:49:25.110 --> 05:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:28.310 --> 05:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much kate any questions
 
05:49:30.628 --> 05:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
yes representative mullen
 
05:49:32.390 --> 05:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you ms
 
05:49:34.470 --> 05:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
baker for taking my question hard to see
 
05:49:36.708 --> 05:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
you yeah i know
 
05:49:38.868 --> 05:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
it's okay if i lean right and you lean
 
05:49:38.878 --> 05:49:39.140 align:start position:0%
it's okay if i lean right and you lean
left

05:49:39.140 --> 05:49:39.150 align:start position:0%
left
 
05:49:39.150 --> 05:49:42.230 align:start position:0%
left
[Laughter]

05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:45.910 --> 05:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
background checks yeah sure uh you just
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
said that you don't feel that you need
 
05:49:49.990 --> 05:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
to change anything mix it up improve
 
05:49:51.270 --> 05:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
anything so
 
05:49:53.670 --> 05:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
the providers have applicable laws that
 
05:49:55.750 --> 05:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
they have to abide by
 
05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of background checks and there
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
is some work in the rules process right
 
05:50:01.350 --> 05:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
now about that
 
05:50:03.270 --> 05:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
and we'll implement whatever the
 
05:50:06.628 --> 05:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
existing laws or rules are i just don't
 
05:50:08.310 --> 05:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
think any changes need to be made at
 
05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
this time
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
could i follow up with yesterday
 
05:50:14.070 --> 05:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
um i hear you yeah and i've looked at
 
05:50:16.310 --> 05:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
those rules background checks seems to
 
05:50:18.868 --> 05:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
be my thing yeah i know and totally get
 
05:50:18.878 --> 05:50:20.070 align:start position:0%
be my thing yeah i know and totally get
it

05:50:20.070 --> 05:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:50:24.150 --> 05:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:27.910 --> 05:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
would would you would it be fair to say
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
that it's a good idea if somebody is
 
05:50:32.230 --> 05:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to be instructing a child
 
05:50:34.230 --> 05:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
particularly alone
 
05:50:35.910 --> 05:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
that they have a criminal background
 
05:50:37.670 --> 05:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
check before they work with that child i
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
mean my understanding is the people are
 
05:50:43.830 --> 05:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:43.840 --> 05:50:44.708 align:start position:0%
 
which

05:50:44.708 --> 05:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:50:47.030 --> 05:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
which people for example all the private
 
05:50:48.628 --> 05:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
schools in new hampshire are conducting
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
background checks right music teachers
 
05:50:52.948 --> 05:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
at music schools i mean in my experience
 
05:50:54.948 --> 05:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
when i volunteered in a school i get a
 
05:50:56.548 --> 05:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
background check and so it is my
 
05:50:57.750 --> 05:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that most people are doing
 
05:51:00.390 --> 05:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
that anyway although again i'm not up to
 
05:51:02.230 --> 05:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
speed on what you're what you're
 
05:51:04.548 --> 05:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
referring to okay so yeah
 
05:51:06.390 --> 05:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
asking them we're asking them to comply
 
05:51:08.470 --> 05:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
with the existing laws that pertain to
 
05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
them so my
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
my um yeah my response to that would be
 
05:51:14.310 --> 05:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
that if they're already doing it great
 
05:51:15.670 --> 05:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to be an issue
 
05:51:17.350 --> 05:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
for them or anybody else if they're
 
05:51:19.670 --> 05:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
already doing it but i'm concerned and
 
05:51:21.590 --> 05:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'm interested my question to you
 
05:51:23.350 --> 05:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
because that's going to make me ask one
 
05:51:23.360 --> 05:51:24.150 align:start position:0%
because that's going to make me ask one
is

05:51:24.150 --> 05:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:51:26.230 --> 05:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
what what is your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mic and see
 
05:51:28.470 --> 05:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
you at the same time that's okay what is
 
05:51:31.750 --> 05:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
your response to uh what's your response
 
05:51:31.760 --> 05:51:32.948 align:start position:0%
your response to uh what's your response
to

05:51:32.948 --> 05:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:51:35.990 --> 05:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
individual service providers that don't
 
05:51:38.230 --> 05:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
belong to any
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
private school or i'm
 
05:51:42.788 --> 05:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
the i'm concerned about the vetting yes
 
05:51:44.788 --> 05:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about like a two like
 
05:51:46.470 --> 05:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
a music teacher like you're a piano
 
05:51:48.548 --> 05:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
teacher and you teach piano i mean as a
 
05:51:50.868 --> 05:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
parent if i'm signing my child up in a
 
05:51:52.788 --> 05:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
place like that i'm asking them to do
 
05:51:54.470 --> 05:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
that and i'm also checking the sex
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
offender registry and we are doing that
 
05:51:59.110 --> 05:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
type of due diligence on our own when
 
05:52:00.708 --> 05:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
we're on boarding providers we're
 
05:52:02.708 --> 05:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
checking the existing databases that are
 
05:52:04.628 --> 05:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
available to be sure that someone
 
05:52:07.910 --> 05:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up on those registries and
 
05:52:07.920 --> 05:52:09.110 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up on those registries and
so

05:52:09.110 --> 05:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:52:11.430 --> 05:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's my answer to your question yeah
 
05:52:13.750 --> 05:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much uh further
 
05:52:13.760 --> 05:52:15.030 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much uh further
questions

05:52:15.030 --> 05:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:52:17.430 --> 05:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
i like the good questions so i'm happy
 
05:52:18.868 --> 05:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
you've got me here for a minute
 
05:52:20.830 --> 05:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
everybody all questions are good
 
05:52:23.910 --> 05:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh thank you
 
05:52:25.590 --> 05:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
not that your question wasn't that's a
 
05:52:27.190 --> 05:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
good question too i mean i mean deep
 
05:52:29.350 --> 05:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
questions is what i like no you don't
 
05:52:31.910 --> 05:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
have time for this well chairman ladd
 
05:52:31.920 --> 05:52:33.030 align:start position:0%
have time for this well chairman ladd
representative

05:52:33.030 --> 05:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:52:34.470 --> 05:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
05:52:36.868 --> 05:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
yes can you give us an idea of the
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
percent of kids
 
05:52:41.350 --> 05:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
who are taking advantage of the efa
 
05:52:41.360 --> 05:52:42.390 align:start position:0%
who are taking advantage of the efa
program

05:52:42.390 --> 05:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
who are special needs
 
05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
and in particular
 
05:52:49.670 --> 05:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
well i guess it's two questions the
 
05:52:51.510 --> 05:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
other is those who
 
05:52:54.628 --> 05:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
were at some point in the public school
 
05:52:54.638 --> 05:52:55.830 align:start position:0%
were at some point in the public school
before

05:52:55.830 --> 05:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:52:58.628 --> 05:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
um leaving sure yeah you guys have spent
 
05:53:01.430 --> 05:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of time on that in here and so
 
05:53:03.750 --> 05:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
the data from the department of ed that
 
05:53:05.830 --> 05:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
we all crunched together
 
05:53:08.470 --> 05:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
is the number of 280 that you've been
 
05:53:10.230 --> 05:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
using is correct if you're looking at
 
05:53:11.990 --> 05:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
the switchers from november when the
 
05:53:13.510 --> 05:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
program started right the kids that
 
05:53:15.990 --> 05:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
moved this year usually when you ask me
 
05:53:17.990 --> 05:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
about switchers in our program you're
 
05:53:20.070 --> 05:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
talking about kids from the prior year
 
05:53:21.270 --> 05:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay when we count them in the tax
 
05:53:22.470 --> 05:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
credit program we're usually looking at
 
05:53:24.470 --> 05:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
the prior year so you've got your 280
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
from this year and then you've got 220
 
05:53:28.230 --> 05:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
from the prior year
 
05:53:30.230 --> 05:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
and then i think of it in terms of all
 
05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
the families that drove this into
 
05:53:34.628 --> 05:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
existence right so there was that period
 
05:53:36.390 --> 05:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
of time when the schools were closed
 
05:53:39.030 --> 05:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
when families needed these resources and
 
05:53:42.150 --> 05:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
they drove this program into existence
 
05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
and so to me those switchers the
 
05:53:46.310 --> 05:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
switchers in the pandemic and right
 
05:53:47.830 --> 05:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
before that
 
05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
shutdowns happened or the families that
 
05:53:52.070 --> 05:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
drove this program and so if you if you
 
05:53:53.830 --> 05:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
want to look at the data from any kid
 
05:53:55.910 --> 05:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
that ever stepped foot into a public
 
05:53:58.070 --> 05:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
school in the entire existence there's a
 
05:53:59.830 --> 05:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
lot of them but if you want to talk
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
about how many kids moved right now
 
05:54:04.390 --> 05:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative luna's been telling you
 
05:54:07.430 --> 05:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
right to 280 from just this fall we
 
05:54:09.990 --> 05:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
didn't start the program until november
 
05:54:11.750 --> 05:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
and so you wouldn't expect very many
 
05:54:13.270 --> 05:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
kids to switch right now in the middle
 
05:54:14.708 --> 05:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
of a school year
 
05:54:16.150 --> 05:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
did that help oh and you asked me about
 
05:54:17.670 --> 05:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
special needs kids
 
05:54:20.310 --> 05:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
so our average of special needs kids in
 
05:54:22.470 --> 05:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
our program over the course of it ranges
 
05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
between like 10 and 20 percent
 
05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
in this little education freedom account
 
05:54:27.440 --> 05:54:28.390 align:start position:0%
in this little education freedom account
group

05:54:28.390 --> 05:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:54:31.910 --> 05:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's five percent but remember that
 
05:54:33.670 --> 05:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
we're not qualifying kids for special
 
05:54:35.510 --> 05:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
education we're qualifying them for the
 
05:54:37.350 --> 05:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid piece and they have
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
to provide a special documentation for
 
05:54:42.070 --> 05:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
that so there might be a family in the
 
05:54:44.548 --> 05:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
program who has a child with special
 
05:54:46.628 --> 05:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
needs who's using the program to meet
 
05:54:48.390 --> 05:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
those child special needs but they
 
05:54:50.310 --> 05:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
haven't given us the documentation to
 
05:54:52.548 --> 05:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
get the differentiated aid right so
 
05:54:53.910 --> 05:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're qualifying the kids for
 
05:54:56.150 --> 05:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid not special ed
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
services so what we have is five percent
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
of the kids are qualified for that
 
05:55:02.470 --> 05:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid based on the
 
05:55:04.948 --> 05:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
documentation they gave us that doesn't
 
05:55:06.948 --> 05:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that they
 
05:55:08.628 --> 05:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
you know there aren't more children that
 
05:55:10.788 --> 05:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
have special needs in the program
 
05:55:12.470 --> 05:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of the providers you'll i don't
 
05:55:13.510 --> 05:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
know if you've looked at the list but a
 
05:55:15.190 --> 05:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
lot of the providers are people who are
 
05:55:18.628 --> 05:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
doing special ed services
 
05:55:20.548 --> 05:55:20.558 align:start position:0%
and i'm seeing a lot of that thank you i
 
05:55:22.470 --> 05:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
love these questions anyone else why you
 
05:55:27.430 --> 05:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:29.750 --> 05:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh generally speaking
 
05:55:31.110 --> 05:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
are the um
 
05:55:33.030 --> 05:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
students uh happy with the program who
 
05:55:33.990 --> 05:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
are in it
 
05:55:35.910 --> 05:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
i mean yes we've been a little bit slow
 
05:55:38.310 --> 05:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
in approving expenses because for each
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
transaction that goes through the
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
digital wallet my team asked themselves
 
05:55:44.948 --> 05:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
a series of like seven qualifying
 
05:55:47.750 --> 05:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions and we're also googling all of
 
05:55:49.750 --> 05:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
the items that are in there to make sure
 
05:55:51.910 --> 05:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
that they are at an educational expense
 
05:55:53.990 --> 05:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
in addition matching them with the
 
05:55:55.990 --> 05:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate grade level and the core
 
05:55:57.830 --> 05:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge subject which you talked about
 
05:55:59.990 --> 05:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
earlier so i wish we could be a little
 
05:56:01.830 --> 05:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
bit faster for the families i get a lot
 
05:56:04.230 --> 05:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
of messages saying it's taking you too
 
05:56:05.830 --> 05:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
long to approve my orders takes about
 
05:56:08.150 --> 05:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
two weeks to get through the queue of
 
05:56:09.750 --> 05:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
orders that's sitting there i wish we
 
05:56:11.670 --> 05:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
were a little bit faster
 
05:56:13.510 --> 05:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's also a little bit slow when we give
 
05:56:15.510 --> 05:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
the department of education our list it
 
05:56:18.548 --> 05:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
takes a full 30 days after that for them
 
05:56:21.190 --> 05:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
to run their cross checks on the sassage
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
the unique people identifiers which you
 
05:56:24.628 --> 05:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
guys have talked about in here and then
 
05:56:27.990 --> 05:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
to say to us yes this child is qualified
 
05:56:29.590 --> 05:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the program i wish that was a little
 
05:56:32.868 --> 05:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
bit faster also but i appreciate the
 
05:56:35.590 --> 05:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
steps that we're taking that are
 
05:56:37.430 --> 05:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
the as you've been talking about in here
 
05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency right
 
05:56:41.590 --> 05:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that the doe is cross-checking
 
05:56:44.070 --> 05:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
the sacids is a really important piece
 
05:56:45.670 --> 05:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
and they'll say okay we've got an
 
05:56:47.670 --> 05:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
anomaly here or a district will write to
 
05:56:49.350 --> 05:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
me we've got an anomaly here where the
 
05:56:50.948 --> 05:56:50.958 align:start position:0%
kid is enrolled in our district and in
 
05:56:52.390 --> 05:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
your program and then we've got to find
 
05:56:54.390 --> 05:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
out you know does the child not belong
 
05:56:56.628 --> 05:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
or did they mean to transfer and and so
 
05:56:58.310 --> 05:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a slow process
 
05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
but i think all of those pieces are
 
05:57:05.350 --> 05:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:07.270 --> 05:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
he's gonna he's gonna send him off he's
 
05:57:09.270 --> 05:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
gonna kill us are you done with the
 
05:57:11.030 --> 05:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
questioning representative
 
05:57:12.948 --> 05:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative thank you i know we want
 
05:57:14.628 --> 05:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
to keep moving but representative saudi
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
inspired me uh
 
05:57:19.990 --> 05:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of this is new yeah and in
 
05:57:23.350 --> 05:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
terms of self-assessment quality control
 
05:57:26.070 --> 05:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
evaluations uh could you speak to
 
05:57:27.750 --> 05:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
what is in place or what will be in
 
05:57:31.030 --> 05:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:31.040 --> 05:57:32.070 align:start position:0%
 
people

05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:57:34.868 --> 05:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
evaluating the experience from from
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
different perspectives and also would
 
05:57:39.270 --> 05:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
these evaluations be public yeah so we
 
05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
do survey our existing families and have
 
05:57:43.830 --> 05:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
every year and we were publishing on the
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
website when people were interested in
 
05:57:47.270 --> 05:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
that and so we're glad to continue to do
 
05:57:49.510 --> 05:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
that but we want to survey the families
 
05:57:51.110 --> 05:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
because we want to know from their
 
05:57:52.628 --> 05:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
perspective one
 
05:57:54.230 --> 05:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
how are we doing right how can we
 
05:57:56.390 --> 05:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
improve what what do they want to see
 
05:57:58.470 --> 05:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's not a part there's been some
 
05:58:00.230 --> 05:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
things that people have hoped would be
 
05:58:02.548 --> 05:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
allowable that are not allowable and so
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
i think we can collect that feedback you
 
05:58:06.150 --> 05:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
know some of the questions i like to
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
know is why are you here right why did
 
05:58:10.548 --> 05:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
you choose this program was there
 
05:58:12.708 --> 05:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
something that in your experience that
 
05:58:14.788 --> 05:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
made you come to us right for example
 
05:58:16.390 --> 05:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
how else would i know that so many
 
05:58:18.230 --> 05:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
children come to us because they
 
05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
experience bullying or discrimination or
 
05:58:22.708 --> 05:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
so many kids come to us because they
 
05:58:24.310 --> 05:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
were below grade level and want a
 
05:58:25.990 --> 05:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
smaller class size right that's how we
 
05:58:28.470 --> 05:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
find out all that information and so we
 
05:58:30.150 --> 05:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
survey the families every year we do it
 
05:58:31.910 --> 05:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
towards the end of the year right so we
 
05:58:33.430 --> 05:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
get some good feedback from the
 
05:58:35.430 --> 05:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
experience they had and then we could
 
05:58:37.670 --> 05:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
publish it i mean like our annual report
 
05:58:39.110 --> 05:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
on the website
 
05:58:42.070 --> 05:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's my question
 
05:58:43.990 --> 05:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
if the anonymous evaluation is good or
 
05:58:45.910 --> 05:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
bad sure people can look at it sure yeah
 
05:58:47.190 --> 05:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
i'll give people your number too if they
 
05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
want to complain about me i'm just
 
05:58:50.548 --> 05:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
teasing i'm just cheating
 
05:58:52.708 --> 05:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:58:55.510 --> 05:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'll give them glenn's number actually
 
05:58:59.110 --> 05:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh when a a child or a family uh apply
 
05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
for an essay
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
is there a component or element within
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
that application that answers the
 
05:59:06.548 --> 05:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
question that you you just indicated you
 
05:59:09.430 --> 05:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
wish you could get saying why i'm coming
 
05:59:11.030 --> 05:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
after an efa
 
05:59:12.788 --> 05:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
there isn't a question asking why
 
05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
they're there there's a question asking
 
05:59:16.948 --> 05:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
what they want to do with the money yeah
 
05:59:18.628 --> 05:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
you know and we ask them why they're
 
05:59:20.708 --> 05:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
there after they're in
 
05:59:22.628 --> 05:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
to that bill you talked about at one
 
05:59:24.470 --> 05:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
point right if you asked them the
 
05:59:26.548 --> 05:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
question and required it when they
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
entered they might not be as as truthful
 
05:59:31.110 --> 05:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
as when they're there right after if
 
05:59:32.548 --> 05:59:32.558 align:start position:0%
you've decided you might apply for
 
05:59:33.990 --> 05:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
something and then not decide not to
 
05:59:35.750 --> 05:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
take it for example so i had did have a
 
05:59:37.350 --> 05:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
family who applied for the education
 
05:59:39.510 --> 05:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
freedom account got it i talked to the
 
05:59:41.350 --> 05:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
dad on the phone and said
 
05:59:43.990 --> 05:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
oh you know you have a 15 year old
 
05:59:46.470 --> 05:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
sophomore like is she struggling i said
 
05:59:47.830 --> 05:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
is she struggling you know are you sure
 
05:59:50.230 --> 05:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
you want to transfer and he decided to
 
05:59:52.788 --> 05:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
stay at the school where she was instead
 
05:59:54.470 --> 05:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
of choose the education freedom account
 
05:59:55.990 --> 05:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
we don't need to survey him at that
 
05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
point when he's like should i do
 
06:00:00.708 --> 06:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
something i'm exploring you survey him
 
06:00:03.510 --> 06:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
after he says okay he didn't he they
 
06:00:04.708 --> 06:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
stayed in their public school they
 
06:00:06.150 --> 06:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
decided to stay there
 
06:00:08.150 --> 06:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
once they move to the program then it
 
06:00:09.670 --> 06:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
makes sense to say to them why are you
 
06:00:09.680 --> 06:00:10.868 align:start position:0%
makes sense to say to them why are you
here

06:00:10.868 --> 06:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
right so that's where we survey them so
 
06:00:14.948 --> 06:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
why are you here when you're there
 
06:00:16.548 --> 06:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
once you've made the leap
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
thank you kate eddie yes represent
 
06:00:18.718 --> 06:00:19.670 align:start position:0%
thank you kate eddie yes represent
hobson

06:00:19.670 --> 06:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
hobson
 
06:00:21.430 --> 06:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you for
 
06:00:23.830 --> 06:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony today i was wondering um
 
06:00:26.150 --> 06:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm very interested in the in
 
06:00:28.470 --> 06:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
a report that shows you know what what
 
06:00:30.070 --> 06:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
data you're collecting and i was
 
06:00:32.230 --> 06:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if by any chance you could
 
06:00:34.948 --> 06:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
elaborate on what types of expenses you
 
06:00:37.510 --> 06:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
might see the most of sure so right now
 
06:00:39.350 --> 06:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the most of private school
 
06:00:39.360 --> 06:00:40.628 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the most of private school
tuition

06:00:40.628 --> 06:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
06:00:43.190 --> 06:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
and then tutoring after that and then
 
06:00:46.230 --> 06:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
computers and books predominantly but
 
06:00:47.910 --> 06:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's also data that we can bring at
 
06:00:50.070 --> 06:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the year to look at i know
 
06:00:51.510 --> 06:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'm expected to bring that to the
 
06:00:53.510 --> 06:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and so that might be
 
06:00:55.110 --> 06:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
a good time for everyone to just come to
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee and discuss
 
06:00:59.350 --> 06:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know the those pieces what i like
 
06:01:01.830 --> 06:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
about this program is that we can track
 
06:01:03.910 --> 06:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
down to the pencil what everyone did
 
06:01:05.750 --> 06:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
with this money and then look at it and
 
06:01:08.070 --> 06:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
see is it doing what we wanted it to do
 
06:01:10.390 --> 06:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
right is it meeting the goals
 
06:01:12.150 --> 06:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
from when you put this program into
 
06:01:14.070 --> 06:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
place and is there anything that we
 
06:01:16.470 --> 06:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
would change or do differently and so
 
06:01:18.868 --> 06:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
it's it's been a lot of tutoring a lot
 
06:01:21.430 --> 06:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
of special ed services a lot of tuition
 
06:01:22.708 --> 06:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of books
 
06:01:25.110 --> 06:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of laptops people did not have
 
06:01:29.510 --> 06:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
access to laptops or technology or ipads
 
06:01:31.350 --> 06:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
like you might think they do right
 
06:01:33.110 --> 06:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
because it's easy for us to get one you
 
06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
think everybody has one people do not
 
06:01:37.430 --> 06:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
have access to and you want to do online
 
06:01:39.190 --> 06:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
classes so many home schoolers want to
 
06:01:41.510 --> 06:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
do online classes and never had access
 
06:01:44.070 --> 06:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate technology to be able
 
06:01:46.070 --> 06:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
to do that they did put in the rules
 
06:01:48.390 --> 06:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
just so you know the cap of one every
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
three years and so i think that was a
 
06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to meet the need but also
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
make it so that it's not over the top
 
06:01:58.868 --> 06:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay fine love it
 
06:02:06.470 --> 06:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:08.230 --> 06:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
she'll be back
 
06:02:13.270 --> 06:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:14.708 --> 06:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
she's not here
 
06:02:28.548 --> 06:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:33.830 --> 06:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:35.350 --> 06:02:35.360 align:start position:0%

public employees
 
06:02:57.350 --> 06:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today to speak in support
 
06:03:00.310 --> 06:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
06:03:02.070 --> 06:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
i will try not to repeat too much of
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
what has been said already
 
06:03:06.070 --> 06:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
the representative has gone over the
 
06:03:08.310 --> 06:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
legislative history of this bill uh very
 
06:03:10.470 --> 06:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
thoroughly so i will
 
06:03:12.230 --> 06:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
dive right in
 
06:03:14.548 --> 06:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
the money that is being spent on this is
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
going to help a very small number of
 
06:03:16.558 --> 06:03:17.430 align:start position:0%
going to help a very small number of
students

06:03:17.430 --> 06:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
students
 
06:03:18.868 --> 06:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
the only firm number we've been able to
 
06:03:20.628 --> 06:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
get is from the department of ed's
 
06:03:22.628 --> 06:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
report from november when the program
 
06:03:25.190 --> 06:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
started when there were 1635 students
 
06:03:27.990 --> 06:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the voucher program
 
06:03:29.990 --> 06:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
of those 280 are ones who have just
 
06:03:32.070 --> 06:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
recently left public schools
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
so most of the money that uh taxpayer
 
06:03:36.948 --> 06:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
money that's being spent on this
 
06:03:38.548 --> 06:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
is subsidies for families who are
 
06:03:41.110 --> 06:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
already finding other ways to meet their
 
06:03:41.120 --> 06:03:42.948 align:start position:0%
already finding other ways to meet their
students

06:03:42.948 --> 06:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
students
 
06:03:45.030 --> 06:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
educational needs
 
06:03:45.040 --> 06:03:46.070 align:start position:0%
educational needs
and

06:03:46.070 --> 06:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:48.470 --> 06:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
i listen very carefully when the
 
06:03:49.990 --> 06:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill that was very similar to
 
06:03:53.350 --> 06:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
this was heard the other week because
 
06:03:55.510 --> 06:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
i wanted to think
 
06:03:58.150 --> 06:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
very carefully about what to say
 
06:03:58.160 --> 06:04:00.628 align:start position:0%
very carefully about what to say
um

06:04:00.628 --> 06:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
and i heard the
 
06:04:06.070 --> 06:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
and passion please to continue this
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
program because i am very mindful of how
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
students are enrolled in programs and
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
how they want to continue it's all about
 
06:04:14.830 --> 06:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
the educational
 
06:04:17.350 --> 06:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
fit and
 
06:04:19.750 --> 06:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
educational fit is important it's also
 
06:04:21.590 --> 06:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
very important for the hundred and sixty
 
06:04:23.910 --> 06:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
thousand plus students who are in uh
 
06:04:25.910 --> 06:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
06:04:29.110 --> 06:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
all of our students deserve
 
06:04:31.590 --> 06:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
small class sizes individual attention
 
06:04:34.470 --> 06:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
from a teacher support from caring para
 
06:04:36.310 --> 06:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
educators they deserve engaging
 
06:04:38.868 --> 06:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
curriculums they deserve
 
06:04:42.390 --> 06:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
lots of chances to engage in science and
 
06:04:45.190 --> 06:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
technology enrichment activities
 
06:04:48.150 --> 06:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
languages arts all these things that
 
06:04:51.030 --> 06:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:53.670 --> 06:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
engaging and inviting a place where they
 
06:04:55.350 --> 06:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
want to be a community where they want
 
06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
to belong
 
06:04:59.830 --> 06:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
and that's what i want to bring up here
 
06:05:01.830 --> 06:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
this program was passed so quickly
 
06:05:04.548 --> 06:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
without the chance to have a full
 
06:05:08.070 --> 06:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
examination of the financial impact the
 
06:05:10.150 --> 06:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
estimates for what it was going to cost
 
06:05:13.110 --> 06:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
for way off and that eight million
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
dollars that it it is costing the
 
06:05:15.520 --> 06:05:17.270 align:start position:0%
dollars that it it is costing the
taxpayers

06:05:17.270 --> 06:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
06:05:19.670 --> 06:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
could have been spent on
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
200 nurses for public schools
 
06:05:24.868 --> 06:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
it could have been spent on 160
 
06:05:26.628 --> 06:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers
 
06:05:29.190 --> 06:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
430 para educators who can sit with
 
06:05:31.030 --> 06:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
students in small group and give them
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
extra help and go over the lesson their
 
06:05:35.510 --> 06:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher have taught
 
06:05:37.830 --> 06:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
and help them practice their skills it
 
06:05:41.030 --> 06:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
could mean the difference between
 
06:05:42.948 --> 06:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
many hundreds of students getting
 
06:05:45.430 --> 06:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
individualized attention
 
06:05:47.510 --> 06:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to speak up for those
 
06:05:49.750 --> 06:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
students who are are in public schools
 
06:05:51.990 --> 06:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
who could be getting a lot more
 
06:05:54.390 --> 06:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
of that individualized attention that
 
06:05:56.470 --> 06:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
feeling of belonging in an educational
 
06:05:58.230 --> 06:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
community that fits them
 
06:05:59.670 --> 06:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
if we weren't
 
06:06:02.390 --> 06:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
spending money on a program
 
06:06:04.470 --> 06:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
that wasn't planned for in the budget
 
06:06:06.310 --> 06:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
that was rushed through that as we've
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
heard the rules are still being written
 
06:06:10.788 --> 06:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
for this program
 
06:06:12.150 --> 06:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
i want to bring a few more points to
 
06:06:15.830 --> 06:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:17.510 --> 06:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
more than 80 percent of new hampshire
 
06:06:17.520 --> 06:06:19.030 align:start position:0%
more than 80 percent of new hampshire
families

06:06:19.030 --> 06:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
families
 
06:06:20.948 --> 06:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
choose to send their students to public
 
06:06:20.958 --> 06:06:22.948 align:start position:0%
choose to send their students to public
schools

06:06:22.948 --> 06:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:06:26.070 --> 06:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
that is where they want their students
 
06:06:27.510 --> 06:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
and they are happy with their public
 
06:06:27.520 --> 06:06:29.030 align:start position:0%
and they are happy with their public
schools

06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:06:30.628 --> 06:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
we did
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
a big survey in december 2021 and it was
 
06:06:36.708 --> 06:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
equally divided between republican
 
06:06:38.548 --> 06:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
democrat and undeclared it was done by
 
06:06:39.990 --> 06:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
heart research
 
06:06:40.000 --> 06:06:41.270 align:start position:0%
heart research
and

06:06:41.270 --> 06:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:41.280 --> 06:06:43.270 align:start position:0%
and
overwhelmingly

06:06:43.270 --> 06:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly
 
06:06:44.788 --> 06:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
voters in new hampshire want to see
 
06:06:46.548 --> 06:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
stronger investment in public schools to
 
06:06:48.548 --> 06:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
benefit all students
 
06:06:52.470 --> 06:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
74 c say we need greater investment
 
06:06:54.868 --> 06:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
in our public schools 72 percent want
 
06:06:56.628 --> 06:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
better public schools for all instead of
 
06:06:58.708 --> 06:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
vouchers for a few
 
06:06:58.718 --> 06:07:00.310 align:start position:0%
vouchers for a few
and

06:07:00.310 --> 06:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:02.390 --> 06:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
um nearly six out of 10 are concerned
 
06:07:04.788 --> 06:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
that their tax dollars are going to
 
06:07:04.798 --> 06:07:07.030 align:start position:0%
that their tax dollars are going to
increase

06:07:07.030 --> 06:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:07:09.350 --> 06:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
because of voucher programs
 
06:07:09.360 --> 06:07:10.230 align:start position:0%
because of voucher programs
so

06:07:10.230 --> 06:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:11.910 --> 06:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
the message to us was clear we want to
 
06:07:14.708 --> 06:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
see our public schools strengthened we
 
06:07:16.150 --> 06:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to see
 
06:07:17.590 --> 06:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
tax money
 
06:07:17.600 --> 06:07:18.708 align:start position:0%
tax money
going

06:07:18.708 --> 06:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
going
 
06:07:18.718 --> 06:07:21.190 align:start position:0%
going
for

06:07:21.190 --> 06:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:23.590 --> 06:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
families that make what are private
 
06:07:25.830 --> 06:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
education choices
 
06:07:27.270 --> 06:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
for a different
 
06:07:29.990 --> 06:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
solution which they're they're entirely
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
entitled to make
 
06:07:34.788 --> 06:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
but our public money needs to stay in
 
06:07:36.868 --> 06:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
strengthening our public schools for all
 
06:07:38.548 --> 06:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
of our students
 
06:07:40.628 --> 06:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
so they can all have that wonderful fit
 
06:07:42.948 --> 06:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
not just the towns that happen to be
 
06:07:46.150 --> 06:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
blessed with good property tax basis
 
06:07:47.750 --> 06:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
and that's really all i want to say and
 
06:07:50.150 --> 06:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
i will see myself time to the many
 
06:07:51.670 --> 06:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
others who want to speak unless there
 
06:07:53.190 --> 06:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
are questions thank you very much are
 
06:07:55.990 --> 06:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
06:08:00.708 --> 06:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:02.868 --> 06:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
since you brought up money
 
06:08:02.878 --> 06:08:04.230 align:start position:0%
since you brought up money
um

06:08:04.230 --> 06:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:05.670 --> 06:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
does it
 
06:08:10.390 --> 06:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:12.230 --> 06:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
i had it
 
06:08:16.390 --> 06:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:18.150 --> 06:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
06:08:20.390 --> 06:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
since you brought up money
 
06:08:23.910 --> 06:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
does it make more sense
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
if you're worried about proper care and
 
06:08:29.670 --> 06:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
spending of public money and whatever to
 
06:08:31.590 --> 06:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
spend twenty thousand to educate a
 
06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
student or four thousand to educate a
 
06:08:33.680 --> 06:08:41.590 align:start position:0%
student or four thousand to educate a
student

06:08:41.590 --> 06:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:45.990 --> 06:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
the thing is that we don't parcel out
 
06:08:47.590 --> 06:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
the money individually when we're
 
06:08:49.430 --> 06:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
talking about the police department or
 
06:08:51.030 --> 06:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
the fire department or the road
 
06:08:52.948 --> 06:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
department we don't divide their budgets
 
06:08:54.788 --> 06:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
by the number of taxpayers in town and
 
06:08:57.750 --> 06:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
give each person an individual account
 
06:08:57.760 --> 06:08:58.788 align:start position:0%
give each person an individual account
to

06:08:58.788 --> 06:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:09:00.708 --> 06:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
go build their part of the road that
 
06:09:01.670 --> 06:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
they use
 
06:09:03.350 --> 06:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's a common
 
06:09:05.110 --> 06:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
good that we all use the schools work
 
06:09:06.708 --> 06:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
the same way and it's an economy of
 
06:09:10.070 --> 06:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
scale if you have one student leave you
 
06:09:12.628 --> 06:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
don't reduce your costs
 
06:09:14.150 --> 06:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
by that much
 
06:09:17.110 --> 06:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
sorry i forgot to lean into the mic
 
06:09:19.270 --> 06:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay because schools do run on an
 
06:09:21.110 --> 06:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
economy of scale and you do reduce your
 
06:09:22.868 --> 06:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
cost some when one student sleeps but
 
06:09:24.470 --> 06:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily enough
 
06:09:26.230 --> 06:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
by the amount of money that you have
 
06:09:32.150 --> 06:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:34.150 --> 06:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
so and
 
06:09:36.788 --> 06:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you welcome
 
06:09:39.190 --> 06:09:39.200 align:start position:0%

under prenda which has been developed
 
06:10:22.628 --> 06:10:22.638 align:start position:0%
years ago in the west coast but new
 
06:10:24.230 --> 06:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of education has
 
06:10:26.390 --> 06:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
adopted and supported
 
06:10:28.708 --> 06:10:28.718 align:start position:0%
our program to educate as an alternative
 
06:10:30.628 --> 06:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
schooling program for children that
 
06:10:33.030 --> 06:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
choose a smaller environment
 
06:10:34.708 --> 06:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
and a unique environment that suits
 
06:10:35.830 --> 06:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
their needs
 
06:10:37.190 --> 06:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
so my children will be sharing their
 
06:10:39.110 --> 06:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
experience with their homeschooling
 
06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
and their astronomical growth autonomy
 
06:10:43.030 --> 06:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
and individuality that the micro school
 
06:10:45.030 --> 06:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
has allowed for them personally
 
06:10:46.788 --> 06:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
this is in response of the efa funding
 
06:10:48.708 --> 06:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
and how we support it and how it will be
 
06:10:51.190 --> 06:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
effective to us at the micro school and
 
06:10:52.230 --> 06:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
as a
 
06:10:57.030 --> 06:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:58.868 --> 06:10:58.878 align:start position:0%

06:11:13.510 --> 06:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
i want to tell you that the academic
 
06:11:15.670 --> 06:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
resources that we are receiving
 
06:11:17.990 --> 06:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
supports all of my children in one way
 
06:11:20.390 --> 06:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
or another the funds support material
 
06:11:21.990 --> 06:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
that my children and students eagerly
 
06:11:23.750 --> 06:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
apply to their academic growth and
 
06:11:25.670 --> 06:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
without it i would otherwise be able to
 
06:11:25.680 --> 06:11:26.628 align:start position:0%
without it i would otherwise be able to
afford

06:11:26.628 --> 06:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
afford
 
06:11:26.638 --> 06:11:27.590 align:start position:0%

efa

06:11:27.590 --> 06:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
efa
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
allows students
 
06:11:31.350 --> 06:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
to utilize the resources to spark their
 
06:11:33.910 --> 06:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
interest with hands-on experiences
 
06:11:36.230 --> 06:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
and to join others that have likewise
 
06:11:38.470 --> 06:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
minds that they want to learn that way
 
06:11:40.150 --> 06:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
the educational freedom account supports
 
06:11:42.070 --> 06:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
a place like our micro school a place
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
where we are confident in our children's
 
06:11:46.230 --> 06:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
safety during their learning a place
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
that sparks the interest of the child
 
06:11:50.628 --> 06:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
a resource that is provided to assist in
 
06:11:52.470 --> 06:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
providing materials to our youngsters
 
06:11:54.070 --> 06:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
that have chosen to learn in the smaller
 
06:11:55.750 --> 06:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
environment like i said
 
06:11:57.190 --> 06:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
it is a place where students are not
 
06:11:58.948 --> 06:11:58.958 align:start position:0%
measured in comparison to others but are
 
06:12:00.470 --> 06:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
measured on how they show their personal
 
06:12:00.480 --> 06:12:02.628 align:start position:0%
measured on how they show their personal
competencies

06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
06:12:05.430 --> 06:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
the efa helps support a place that they
 
06:12:08.548 --> 06:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
do not need to be molded to fit in a box
 
06:12:10.310 --> 06:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
a place where the test scores show only
 
06:12:11.990 --> 06:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
the personal growth and not comparison
 
06:12:14.548 --> 06:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:16.310 --> 06:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
our place is a place where hands-on
 
06:12:18.470 --> 06:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
experiences allow for individuality
 
06:12:20.628 --> 06:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
uniqueness and pride
 
06:12:22.628 --> 06:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
please support the efa so programs like
 
06:12:24.070 --> 06:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
mine can celebrate children in their
 
06:12:26.070 --> 06:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
abilities feed their desire to learn and
 
06:12:27.750 --> 06:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
support our future
 
06:12:30.150 --> 06:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
efa has supported our youngest citizens
 
06:12:31.830 --> 06:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
please be mindful when considering the
 
06:12:34.708 --> 06:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
individuality uniqueness and of each
 
06:12:36.948 --> 06:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
student's academic journey
 
06:12:38.470 --> 06:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i answered
 
06:12:39.750 --> 06:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
gave enough information to tell you who
 
06:12:41.670 --> 06:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
i was but my kids have prepared
 
06:12:42.868 --> 06:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
something for them to share with you
 
06:12:44.548 --> 06:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
guys with their experience
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:12:51.430 --> 06:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:53.670 --> 06:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
were your children out of school when
 
06:12:55.030 --> 06:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
you started this program or did you take
 
06:12:56.070 --> 06:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
them off school
 
06:12:58.390 --> 06:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
um so my children attended public school
 
06:13:00.310 --> 06:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
right before this program started before
 
06:13:02.150 --> 06:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
the program started i was homeschooling
 
06:13:04.150 --> 06:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:13:09.750 --> 06:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:11.990 --> 06:13:12.000 align:start position:0%

06:13:25.270 --> 06:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:28.070 --> 06:13:28.080 align:start position:0%

we participate in a prenda pod in
 
06:14:53.430 --> 06:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
meredith new hampshire aprendipod is a
 
06:14:55.270 --> 06:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
one of a kind learning program that
 
06:14:57.670 --> 06:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
focuses on the students academic needs
 
06:15:00.070 --> 06:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
through community autonomy mindset and
 
06:15:00.080 --> 06:15:01.190 align:start position:0%
through community autonomy mindset and
purpose

06:15:01.190 --> 06:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
06:15:03.270 --> 06:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
we believe that a student's education
 
06:15:05.030 --> 06:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooled or not should be equally
 
06:15:07.190 --> 06:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
important to the priorities of funding
 
06:15:09.590 --> 06:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
through the department of education
 
06:15:10.788 --> 06:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
meaning that
 
06:15:12.788 --> 06:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
funds towards our education should be
 
06:15:14.548 --> 06:15:14.558 align:start position:0%
permitted to the students and equally
 
06:15:17.030 --> 06:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
justifiable some of us can understand
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
why the public school staff members
 
06:15:20.868 --> 06:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
might feel at a disadvantage but
 
06:15:23.510 --> 06:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
students deserve to learn on their terms
 
06:15:24.708 --> 06:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be forced to meet
 
06:15:27.190 --> 06:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
unreasonable expectations which is why
 
06:15:30.948 --> 06:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
prenda lets us learn on our level
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
some of us learn better
 
06:15:35.030 --> 06:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
put the mic right down that bends so you
 
06:15:37.110 --> 06:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
can go right into it
 
06:15:38.948 --> 06:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
some of us learning
 
06:15:41.030 --> 06:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
some of us learning it better
 
06:15:42.788 --> 06:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
better in a less chaotic environment
 
06:15:44.548 --> 06:15:44.558 align:start position:0%
with less people and less pressure which
 
06:15:46.948 --> 06:15:46.958 align:start position:0%
can lead to unnecessary stress
 
06:15:48.548 --> 06:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
studies show
 
06:15:50.230 --> 06:15:50.240 align:start position:0%

06:16:37.990 --> 06:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
their permission they have excelled two
 
06:16:39.990 --> 06:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
grades in a short time this year filling
 
06:16:43.110 --> 06:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the gap where they want struggles
 
06:16:45.030 --> 06:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
this is because of the ability
 
06:16:46.948 --> 06:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
ambition and opportunity to excel on
 
06:16:48.868 --> 06:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
their terms without being rushed
 
06:16:54.470 --> 06:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:56.788 --> 06:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
our daily activities include a variety
 
06:16:58.628 --> 06:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
of options that expose us to learning
 
06:17:00.310 --> 06:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities that would not otherwise
 
06:17:02.230 --> 06:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
be offered in the public school for
 
06:17:04.310 --> 06:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
example i want to be a veterinarian
 
06:17:06.390 --> 06:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
therefore i am able to have hands-on
 
06:17:08.948 --> 06:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
experience with the farm anal animals at
 
06:17:09.990 --> 06:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
my school
 
06:17:12.868 --> 06:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
i am able to order with the efa funds
 
06:17:15.030 --> 06:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
labs enhanced on activity kits that will
 
06:17:16.788 --> 06:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
further my knowledge and understanding
 
06:17:18.628 --> 06:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
of animals
 
06:17:20.708 --> 06:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
this typically would not be an option if
 
06:17:22.948 --> 06:17:22.958 align:start position:0%
i was in a traditional school this is
 
06:17:24.948 --> 06:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
feeding my desire to learn at my pace
 
06:17:32.310 --> 06:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:35.190 --> 06:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
my example oh sorry
 
06:17:37.190 --> 06:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
my experience with prenda has offered me
 
06:17:39.510 --> 06:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to engage in activities i
 
06:17:41.430 --> 06:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
would not typically be able to choose as
 
06:17:44.230 --> 06:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
an option in traditional school
 
06:17:46.470 --> 06:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
if efa stripped from our ability to
 
06:17:48.548 --> 06:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
access the funds the federal funds may
 
06:17:50.470 --> 06:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
run out and jeopardize the future of our
 
06:17:52.548 --> 06:17:52.558 align:start position:0%
program it would be upsetting to many
 
06:17:56.230 --> 06:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:58.230 --> 06:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
although prenda and homeschooling may
 
06:18:00.150 --> 06:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
seem quite different from public school
 
06:18:02.070 --> 06:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
in which it is we still learn just like
 
06:18:04.470 --> 06:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
everybody else if we feel overwhelmed we
 
06:18:05.990 --> 06:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
can take a break and come back to our
 
06:18:08.470 --> 06:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
studies when our mind is ready to learn
 
06:18:10.150 --> 06:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
in the morning we spend time creating
 
06:18:11.670 --> 06:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
things like art music and doing
 
06:18:13.510 --> 06:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
activities that spark our inner artists
 
06:18:20.070 --> 06:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:22.230 --> 06:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
we also pay attention to important core
 
06:18:24.230 --> 06:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
programming like lexia language arts
 
06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
cern math and reading and writing
 
06:18:27.990 --> 06:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
through a digital platform we spend a
 
06:18:29.990 --> 06:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
majority of our time outdoors hiking
 
06:18:31.830 --> 06:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
working with the animals climbing trees
 
06:18:34.150 --> 06:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
and gardening we play we embrace the
 
06:18:37.750 --> 06:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
natural beauty around us
 
06:18:39.110 --> 06:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
we will learn
 
06:18:41.590 --> 06:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
we learn and we work with each other as
 
06:18:42.948 --> 06:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
a community through unplugged
 
06:18:44.788 --> 06:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities that encourage alternative
 
06:18:47.910 --> 06:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:50.150 --> 06:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
efa offers us a multitude of
 
06:18:52.310 --> 06:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities that provide us a creative
 
06:18:53.830 --> 06:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
new way to learn that promotes
 
06:18:53.840 --> 06:18:55.350 align:start position:0%
new way to learn that promotes
individuality

06:18:55.350 --> 06:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
individuality
 
06:18:57.590 --> 06:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
community and encourages autonomy and
 
06:18:59.590 --> 06:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
the ability to take control of our
 
06:19:02.150 --> 06:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
academic journey with efa we know we can
 
06:19:04.230 --> 06:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
have support in educational materials
 
06:19:05.830 --> 06:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
and resources that will further our
 
06:19:08.230 --> 06:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
learning interest with efa we will be
 
06:19:10.788 --> 06:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
able to conti continue programming like
 
06:19:13.110 --> 06:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
prenda for young aspiring citizens
 
06:19:16.150 --> 06:19:16.160 align:start position:0%

challenges and successes we could not do
 
06:19:28.390 --> 06:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
it without efa

the whole world saw you this is being
 
06:19:38.948 --> 06:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
streamed so folks outside also see
 
06:19:40.948 --> 06:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
06:19:42.788 --> 06:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
good job
 
06:19:48.070 --> 06:19:48.080 align:start position:0%

i wanted to talk about matthew my son he
 
06:20:02.788 --> 06:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
is a efa participant
 
06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
we do homeschooling
 
06:20:05.040 --> 06:20:06.830 align:start position:0%
we do homeschooling
we

06:20:06.830 --> 06:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:20:09.750 --> 06:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
technically um switched from
 
06:20:11.190 --> 06:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
public school which i know you're going
 
06:20:12.468 --> 06:20:12.478 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
06:20:14.868 --> 06:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
but in reality he was waiting for four
 
06:20:14.878 --> 06:20:16.230 align:start position:0%
but in reality he was waiting for four
months

06:20:16.230 --> 06:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
months
 
06:20:18.070 --> 06:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
while the school tried to find an
 
06:20:20.070 --> 06:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate setting for him
 
06:20:22.628 --> 06:20:22.638 align:start position:0%
matthew has ptsd and asperger's he
 
06:20:25.110 --> 06:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
cannot handle himself
 
06:20:27.270 --> 06:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
in a typical school setting
 
06:20:28.868 --> 06:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
matthew was at school
 
06:20:31.030 --> 06:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the behavioral specialist
 
06:20:33.430 --> 06:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
and him were walking down the hallway
 
06:20:35.670 --> 06:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
matthew took off into a run
 
06:20:37.510 --> 06:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
at which point the behavioral specialist
 
06:20:38.868 --> 06:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
grabbed him
 
06:20:40.948 --> 06:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
uh with ptsd we all know we fight flight
 
06:20:44.230 --> 06:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
or freeze right matthew chose to fight
 
06:20:46.948 --> 06:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
at that point matthew was expelled
 
06:20:49.750 --> 06:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
and his iep was pretty much useless at
 
06:20:51.110 --> 06:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
that point
 
06:20:53.830 --> 06:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
um they took him and had him go to mount
 
06:20:56.548 --> 06:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
prospect academy on the at the the
 
06:20:58.468 --> 06:20:58.478 align:start position:0%
school district paid for it
 
06:21:00.868 --> 06:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh to which he was also kicked out of
 
06:21:00.878 --> 06:21:02.390 align:start position:0%
uh to which he was also kicked out of
um

06:21:02.390 --> 06:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:04.708 --> 06:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
he's not a typical settings uh child so
 
06:21:07.350 --> 06:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
i know that this doesn't apply to all
 
06:21:09.910 --> 06:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
but for matthew um
 
06:21:11.670 --> 06:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
he he just couldn't do it
 
06:21:14.548 --> 06:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
he would have anxiety attacks flashbacks
 
06:21:15.910 --> 06:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
and things like that in the in the
 
06:21:17.190 --> 06:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
school setting
 
06:21:20.310 --> 06:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
um you see him here today he's calm he's
 
06:21:22.390 --> 06:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
not really happy to be here
 
06:21:24.948 --> 06:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
but he's handling it right
 
06:21:27.510 --> 06:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
he's been quiet for the most part
 
06:21:29.670 --> 06:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
um this you wouldn't get in the normal
 
06:21:31.510 --> 06:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
school district in the normal school
 
06:21:33.830 --> 06:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
setting because he can't handle it
 
06:21:36.230 --> 06:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's too chaotic there's too much going
 
06:21:39.750 --> 06:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
on and the second a child acts up around
 
06:21:42.468 --> 06:21:42.478 align:start position:0%
him he hops on that bandwagon like gets
 
06:21:44.628 --> 06:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
his job right
 
06:21:44.638 --> 06:21:45.750 align:start position:0%
his job right
so

06:21:45.750 --> 06:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:47.830 --> 06:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
for matthew being able to be taught at
 
06:21:49.830 --> 06:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
home means a lot to us
 
06:21:51.750 --> 06:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
um it means that i'm not dealing with
 
06:21:54.788 --> 06:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
police on a daily basis so that's great
 
06:21:56.628 --> 06:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
it means he no longer has a probation
 
06:21:56.638 --> 06:21:58.468 align:start position:0%
it means he no longer has a probation
officer

06:21:58.468 --> 06:21:58.478 align:start position:0%
officer
 
06:22:00.708 --> 06:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
and that that is quite significant for
 
06:22:02.708 --> 06:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
an eleven-year-old to have
 
06:22:05.830 --> 06:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
two probation officers in his lifetime
 
06:22:05.840 --> 06:22:07.030 align:start position:0%
two probation officers in his lifetime
right

06:22:07.030 --> 06:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:22:09.190 --> 06:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
matthew had gone to a residential
 
06:22:10.948 --> 06:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
treatment facility in allenstown called
 
06:22:13.270 --> 06:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
pinehammon boy center
 
06:22:15.990 --> 06:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
to which he got kicked out of
 
06:22:16.000 --> 06:22:17.030 align:start position:0%
to which he got kicked out of
um

06:22:17.030 --> 06:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:18.468 --> 06:22:18.478 align:start position:0%
the efa
 
06:22:19.830 --> 06:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
and the grant
 
06:22:24.390 --> 06:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:25.990 --> 06:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
educate my child
 
06:22:28.150 --> 06:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
the only way that anyone is able to
 
06:22:30.150 --> 06:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
educate my child the school district
 
06:22:31.190 --> 06:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
failed him
 
06:22:33.030 --> 06:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
we talk about a
 
06:22:34.548 --> 06:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
i don't know the exact words but it was
 
06:22:34.558 --> 06:22:35.628 align:start position:0%
i don't know the exact words but it was
a

06:22:35.628 --> 06:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:22:38.390 --> 06:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
constitutionally approved education it
 
06:22:40.150 --> 06:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't work for him
 
06:22:42.548 --> 06:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work for me
 
06:22:44.708 --> 06:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
we want to talk about a program that has
 
06:22:46.788 --> 06:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
gone six thousand percent over budget
 
06:22:47.990 --> 06:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
06:22:51.030 --> 06:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
and it's because there is such a need
 
06:22:53.110 --> 06:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
in the community there is such a need
 
06:22:55.430 --> 06:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
for these children who cannot be taught
 
06:22:57.910 --> 06:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
in a public school setting to be able to
 
06:23:01.030 --> 06:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
go out there and have their education
 
06:23:03.430 --> 06:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
without that all of these children i
 
06:23:04.788 --> 06:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
mean what are we going to do with them
 
06:23:06.548 --> 06:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
where are we going to put them
 
06:23:09.270 --> 06:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
for children who cannot learn in a
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
public school setting with a bunch of
 
06:23:12.230 --> 06:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
other children
 
06:23:13.510 --> 06:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
what do we do with them how do we
 
06:23:17.030 --> 06:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
educate them if not for the efa
 
06:23:19.270 --> 06:23:19.280 align:start position:0%

full-time dad with these three young

ladies so you can understand the
 
06:27:33.750 --> 06:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
financial burden that that has brought
 
06:27:35.510 --> 06:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
to our picture
 
06:27:38.230 --> 06:27:38.240 align:start position:0%

and i hate to see that taken away
 
06:27:51.590 --> 06:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
because without this
 
06:27:52.788 --> 06:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we can make that
 
06:27:52.798 --> 06:27:53.910 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we can make that
happen

06:27:53.910 --> 06:27:53.920 align:start position:0%

you're off the hook
 
06:28:06.868 --> 06:28:06.878 align:start position:0%
any other families out here that have to
 
06:28:09.910 --> 06:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
hit the road or
 
06:28:22.390 --> 06:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:25.270 --> 06:28:25.280 align:start position:0%

06:28:26.788 --> 06:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is my
 
06:28:29.190 --> 06:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
one of five kids judah he uh came out

the statistic that said six thousand

percent over budget and just repeat that
 
06:28:43.990 --> 06:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know just to see the amount of
 
06:28:45.910 --> 06:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
interest um you know i think it might be
 
06:28:48.070 --> 06:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
a testament just to make us think that
 
06:28:49.430 --> 06:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
what kind of product is the public
 
06:28:51.190 --> 06:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
school giving us
 
06:28:52.628 --> 06:28:52.638 align:start position:0%

06:28:54.070 --> 06:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
from a home school or private school
 
06:28:56.390 --> 06:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
environment into the into this program
 
06:28:57.910 --> 06:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be penalized for trying to
 
06:28:59.910 --> 06:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
escape a subpar product in the public
 
06:28:59.920 --> 06:29:02.868 align:start position:0%
escape a subpar product in the public
schools

06:29:02.868 --> 06:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:05.910 --> 06:29:05.920 align:start position:0%

06:29:20.070 --> 06:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
homeschooled kids is 12.1 percent
 
06:29:23.030 --> 06:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh it actually went up 800 fold 800
 
06:29:23.040 --> 06:29:24.150 align:start position:0%
uh it actually went up 800 fold 800
increase

06:29:24.150 --> 06:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:29:26.230 --> 06:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
so if it's happening in massachusetts uh
 
06:29:27.830 --> 06:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know you can imagine it's uh
 
06:29:28.948 --> 06:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
happening here in new hampshire and all
 
06:29:31.510 --> 06:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
over new england um and and parents are
 
06:29:32.868 --> 06:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
looking for an alternative to the public
 
06:29:32.878 --> 06:29:34.230 align:start position:0%
looking for an alternative to the public
school

06:29:34.230 --> 06:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:29:36.150 --> 06:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
um and i think the the difference of
 
06:29:37.590 --> 06:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
educating a child for four thousand
 
06:29:38.948 --> 06:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
dollars as opposed to twenty thousand
 
06:29:40.628 --> 06:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
dollars is a big deal and it actually
 
06:29:43.030 --> 06:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
can be done for for much less than that
 
06:29:44.948 --> 06:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
um as well in a in a private school
 
06:29:46.548 --> 06:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
environment i have a 16 year old son
 
06:29:48.230 --> 06:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's a bona fide professional
 
06:29:50.708 --> 06:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
carpenter uh and i can really direct his
 
06:29:53.430 --> 06:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
education at a very efficient rate um
 
06:29:54.868 --> 06:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
and he's going to be a very successful
 
06:29:56.468 --> 06:29:56.478 align:start position:0%
young man
 
06:29:56.478 --> 06:29:57.350 align:start position:0%
young man
um

06:29:57.350 --> 06:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:58.708 --> 06:29:58.718 align:start position:0%
you know i think a lot a lot of the
 
06:30:00.150 --> 06:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
public schools are losing trust with
 
06:30:02.310 --> 06:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
many of our families and we see this
 
06:30:03.910 --> 06:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
with you know parents showing up now to
 
06:30:06.390 --> 06:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
school committees uh all over the nation
 
06:30:07.910 --> 06:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
right and i know this for my work in
 
06:30:10.390 --> 06:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts where a lot of parents are
 
06:30:13.030 --> 06:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
upset with crt and congratulations to
 
06:30:14.468 --> 06:30:14.478 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for passing a bill that
 
06:30:17.270 --> 06:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
opposes crt but also the csc the
 
06:30:18.948 --> 06:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
comprehensive sex education you know a
 
06:30:20.390 --> 06:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
lot of parents think that's not age
 
06:30:21.830 --> 06:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate they think it's not
 
06:30:23.270 --> 06:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
medically accurate they think it's not
 
06:30:23.280 --> 06:30:24.708 align:start position:0%
medically accurate they think it's not
evidence-based

06:30:24.708 --> 06:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
evidence-based
 
06:30:26.070 --> 06:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
and it's really making a lot of parents
 
06:30:28.310 --> 06:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
lose trust in the schools the social
 
06:30:30.230 --> 06:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
emotional learning these these surveys
 
06:30:31.990 --> 06:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
that go to these kids without parental
 
06:30:32.000 --> 06:30:33.030 align:start position:0%
that go to these kids without parental
consent

06:30:33.030 --> 06:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
consent
 
06:30:35.110 --> 06:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
and really target kids based on you know
 
06:30:37.030 --> 06:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
not being a part of the group think and
 
06:30:38.628 --> 06:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
this is really the main point i want to
 
06:30:39.990 --> 06:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
make is that the public schools have
 
06:30:42.070 --> 06:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
taken such a large step away from so
 
06:30:44.468 --> 06:30:44.478 align:start position:0%
many families that have different belief
 
06:30:46.390 --> 06:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
systems different morals that we
 
06:30:48.070 --> 06:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be penalizing these families
 
06:30:49.590 --> 06:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
for for the fact that the public school
 
06:30:52.708 --> 06:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
has left them uh regarding their
 
06:30:52.718 --> 06:30:54.948 align:start position:0%
has left them uh regarding their
convictions

06:30:54.948 --> 06:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
convictions
 
06:30:57.110 --> 06:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
the cato institute just said that new
 
06:30:59.110 --> 06:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire out of all 50 states in the
 
06:31:01.350 --> 06:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
union is the free estate
 
06:31:04.628 --> 06:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
out of 50 and that's even above florida
 
06:31:05.670 --> 06:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
where a lot of people seem to be
 
06:31:07.350 --> 06:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
migrating these days so i think a lot of
 
06:31:08.868 --> 06:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
people in new england you know you guys
 
06:31:09.910 --> 06:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
know as well as i do a lot of people
 
06:31:11.110 --> 06:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
that grow up in new england they pretty
 
06:31:12.788 --> 06:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
much stay in new england right so all
 
06:31:14.390 --> 06:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has to do is just keep
 
06:31:16.230 --> 06:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
great programs like this if you want
 
06:31:17.670 --> 06:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
freedom loving people to come to your
 
06:31:20.708 --> 06:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
state um you know this is a wonderful
 
06:31:20.718 --> 06:31:21.750 align:start position:0%
state um you know this is a wonderful
marketing

06:31:21.750 --> 06:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
06:31:29.350 --> 06:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:30.628 --> 06:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
and then also i just want to bring up a
 
06:31:33.110 --> 06:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
personal story i was talking to a father
 
06:31:34.548 --> 06:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
african-american father the other day
 
06:31:36.150 --> 06:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
actually yesterday spoke to me about for
 
06:31:37.510 --> 06:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
30 minutes and
 
06:31:38.948 --> 06:31:38.958 align:start position:0%
he's from a different state he's in he's
 
06:31:40.150 --> 06:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts in worcester but i
 
06:31:42.948 --> 06:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
think i think it's a very um
 
06:31:45.190 --> 06:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
relevant story so he's telling me how
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
he's got four kids in the public school
 
06:31:48.788 --> 06:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
and he's opted them out of sex ed in the
 
06:31:50.310 --> 06:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
public school because he doesn't agree
 
06:31:52.468 --> 06:31:52.478 align:start position:0%
with it right and then he said also the
 
06:31:54.548 --> 06:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
school gave computers to his kids and he
 
06:31:56.310 --> 06:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
said look i i really don't want my kids
 
06:31:57.590 --> 06:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
to have computers like because i don't
 
06:31:59.590 --> 06:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
want them to bring home the technology
 
06:32:00.868 --> 06:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
and i want to have the freedom but you
 
06:32:03.030 --> 06:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
know and he fought the school on it and
 
06:32:05.670 --> 06:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
the school would not you know let him uh
 
06:32:07.030 --> 06:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
have his way like they said no your
 
06:32:09.110 --> 06:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
kid's going to have a computer and so
 
06:32:10.628 --> 06:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
the computer came into the home and the
 
06:32:12.468 --> 06:32:12.478 align:start position:0%
kid you know was looking on the computer
 
06:32:14.230 --> 06:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
and and things were happening as you can
 
06:32:15.510 --> 06:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
imagine with the technology that the
 
06:32:17.350 --> 06:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
parent was in an agreement with
 
06:32:19.270 --> 06:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
and you know and and i told him i felt
 
06:32:21.270 --> 06:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
so bad for him i said well you know can
 
06:32:22.548 --> 06:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
you look into a school alternative or
 
06:32:24.390 --> 06:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
whatever you say well look i my wife and
 
06:32:26.468 --> 06:32:26.478 align:start position:0%
i work two jobs i i can't homeschool my
 
06:32:28.548 --> 06:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
kids you know i can't afford it you know
 
06:32:30.310 --> 06:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
and what a great opportunity to have
 
06:32:32.230 --> 06:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
this kind of program for a parent like
 
06:32:34.468 --> 06:32:34.478 align:start position:0%
that who has fought the school system
 
06:32:35.910 --> 06:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
for the sake of his kids but is now
 
06:32:37.590 --> 06:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
literally he told me that he's losing
 
06:32:39.590 --> 06:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
his relationship with his 15 year old
 
06:32:41.830 --> 06:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
because of this whole computer issue
 
06:32:44.948 --> 06:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
right and so just to listen to parents
 
06:32:46.150 --> 06:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
because this shouldn't make the public
 
06:32:47.510 --> 06:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
school just be no you're taking money
 
06:32:48.628 --> 06:32:48.638 align:start position:0%
away from us this should make the public
 
06:32:50.708 --> 06:32:50.718 align:start position:0%
school say what are we doing wrong what
 
06:32:52.628 --> 06:32:52.638 align:start position:0%
should we be doing so that we can
 
06:32:54.948 --> 06:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
attract these kids back to the public
 
06:32:56.310 --> 06:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
school right
 
06:32:58.468 --> 06:32:58.478 align:start position:0%
um and so the last one i'll make is just
 
06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
on the um the point that was made about
 
06:33:02.230 --> 06:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
funds not being given to religious
 
06:33:03.830 --> 06:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
institutions and i would just remind you
 
06:33:05.190 --> 06:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
all that you know we have this case at
 
06:33:06.468 --> 06:33:06.478 align:start position:0%
the supreme court now in maine the
 
06:33:08.548 --> 06:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
carson versus macon uh that is going to
 
06:33:10.548 --> 06:33:10.558 align:start position:0%
go over this exact point right and i
 
06:33:12.468 --> 06:33:12.478 align:start position:0%
think that uh from what i can tell it's
 
06:33:13.670 --> 06:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a pretty positive decision
 
06:33:15.350 --> 06:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
from the supreme court saying that you
 
06:33:17.270 --> 06:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
can't discriminate against these
 
06:33:18.788 --> 06:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
religious institutions just because
 
06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
they're religious
 
06:33:21.350 --> 06:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
um so i really encourage you to keep
 
06:33:22.708 --> 06:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
these programs i think they're wonderful
 
06:33:23.910 --> 06:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire and i think it's going
 
06:33:26.708 --> 06:33:26.718 align:start position:0%
to really attract people to new
 
06:33:28.390 --> 06:33:28.400 align:start position:0%

06:34:44.788 --> 06:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:47.510 --> 06:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
two are honor students um
 
06:34:49.670 --> 06:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
lucas my great nephew
 
06:34:50.868 --> 06:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
he uh
 
06:34:53.030 --> 06:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
he started a year ago
 
06:34:55.270 --> 06:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
his grades have gone up drastically from
 
06:34:57.670 --> 06:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
where he was his reading comprehension
 
06:34:59.430 --> 06:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
his arithmetic
 
06:35:01.430 --> 06:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
um i attributed a lot of to the teachers
 
06:35:02.830 --> 06:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
at cca
 
06:35:06.070 --> 06:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of dialogue there
 
06:35:08.390 --> 06:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
we don't have any real experience with
 
06:35:10.788 --> 06:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
public schools as far as they've been in
 
06:35:13.990 --> 06:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
private sense but i pretty much moved
 
06:35:15.750 --> 06:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
mountains to keep them there
 
06:35:15.760 --> 06:35:17.030 align:start position:0%
mountains to keep them there
um

06:35:17.030 --> 06:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:19.750 --> 06:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
i know we do pay plenty of taxes
 
06:35:24.708 --> 06:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:26.390 --> 06:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think what else
 
06:35:28.230 --> 06:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
he said i'm a little nervous about this
 
06:35:30.150 --> 06:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
i used to disarm bombs and i don't like
 
06:35:32.240 --> 06:35:32.250 align:start position:0%
public speaking
 
06:35:32.250 --> 06:35:34.868 align:start position:0%
public speaking
[Laughter]

06:35:34.868 --> 06:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:35:37.350 --> 06:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to add voice
 
06:35:41.350 --> 06:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
like thank you um for those who
 
06:35:43.510 --> 06:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
it has really helped us quite a bit um
 
06:35:45.990 --> 06:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
it really actually has kept us in our
 
06:35:47.430 --> 06:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
house this year as everybody knows
 
06:35:50.310 --> 06:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
things have gone up quite a bit
 
06:35:52.708 --> 06:35:52.718 align:start position:0%
i don't know what we do without it um
 
06:35:54.230 --> 06:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
and it's given us some
 
06:35:57.510 --> 06:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
some lateral movement um
 
06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
takes a little bit of stress off of me i
 
06:36:01.190 --> 06:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
know that for sure
 
06:36:01.200 --> 06:36:01.990 align:start position:0%
know that for sure
so

06:36:01.990 --> 06:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:03.750 --> 06:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'll take questions i'm probably better
 
06:36:05.510 --> 06:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
at that
 
06:36:06.948 --> 06:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
disarming uh
 
06:36:09.350 --> 06:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
bombs i retired from
 
06:36:10.868 --> 06:36:10.878 align:start position:0%

i know how
 
06:36:32.070 --> 06:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
hard it is these days to even raise two
 
06:36:33.510 --> 06:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
children on your own and you've taken
 
06:36:34.868 --> 06:36:34.878 align:start position:0%
the third one in when obviously things
 
06:36:37.030 --> 06:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
are tight for you so good for you for
 
06:36:38.948 --> 06:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
taking in a child that obviously needed
 
06:36:40.868 --> 06:36:40.878 align:start position:0%
love from somebody other than where he
 
06:36:43.430 --> 06:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
started and it was very nice to do this
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
so i just want to say thank you because
 
06:36:46.868 --> 06:36:46.878 align:start position:0%

06:37:46.788 --> 06:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
freedom accounts
 
06:37:48.468 --> 06:37:48.478 align:start position:0%
they have been such an extraordinary
 
06:37:50.868 --> 06:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
benefit to my family in my original
 
06:37:54.070 --> 06:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
remarks i wasn't going to address this
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:37:56.868 --> 06:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
i do want to say that we live in a
 
06:37:58.468 --> 06:37:58.478 align:start position:0%
lovely part of new hampshire we
 
06:38:00.788 --> 06:38:00.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely adore it the school district
 
06:38:03.510 --> 06:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
is failing there the scores are not
 
06:38:05.190 --> 06:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
going to
 
06:38:07.110 --> 06:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
probably lower quartile the lowest
 
06:38:09.830 --> 06:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
quartile and we we love it there we love
 
06:38:11.910 --> 06:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we're a part of the revitalization
 
06:38:14.310 --> 06:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
of this part of new hampshire we're very
 
06:38:16.788 --> 06:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
involved in the community but it is only
 
06:38:18.468 --> 06:38:18.478 align:start position:0%
because we homeschool that we're able to
 
06:38:20.788 --> 06:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
be a part of it in that way
 
06:38:21.910 --> 06:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
so i
 
06:38:24.468 --> 06:38:24.478 align:start position:0%
living where i am i would have to move
 
06:38:27.110 --> 06:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
to have that constitutional right
 
06:38:31.430 --> 06:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
without homeschooling and and the efa
 
06:38:33.590 --> 06:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
um as a little background about my
 
06:38:35.270 --> 06:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
family my husband and i have been
 
06:38:37.830 --> 06:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
married 12 years we have five kids ages
 
06:38:39.510 --> 06:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
one through ten
 
06:38:41.590 --> 06:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're both public schooled he is now a
 
06:38:43.190 --> 06:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
lawyer and um
 
06:38:45.030 --> 06:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
i am a therapist trained at the
 
06:38:46.468 --> 06:38:46.478 align:start position:0%
doctorate level with a master's in
 
06:38:49.190 --> 06:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
clinical psychology i'm also a former
 
06:38:51.990 --> 06:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
public high school teacher
 
06:38:53.910 --> 06:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
despite our aptitude for schooling both
 
06:38:55.830 --> 06:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
my husband and i found that we struggled
 
06:38:57.910 --> 06:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
throughout our schooling
 
06:39:00.070 --> 06:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
in different ways and we learned over
 
06:39:01.670 --> 06:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
time as we both have professional
 
06:39:04.788 --> 06:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
degrees how to learn in a way where we
 
06:39:06.468 --> 06:39:06.478 align:start position:0%
could excel
 
06:39:08.390 --> 06:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
so when we were married we had children
 
06:39:10.070 --> 06:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
we decided we wanted them to homeschool
 
06:39:12.310 --> 06:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
as well so i am one of those who always
 
06:39:14.390 --> 06:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
intended to homeschool but
 
06:39:16.868 --> 06:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
many of you may realize that the choice
 
06:39:19.110 --> 06:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
to homeschool means that you have
 
06:39:21.510 --> 06:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
significant financial sacrifices you
 
06:39:24.150 --> 06:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
make generally you have to uh someone
 
06:39:26.390 --> 06:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
has to stay home and i was offered my
 
06:39:28.230 --> 06:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
dream job
 
06:39:30.548 --> 06:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
and we would have been doing
 
06:39:32.150 --> 06:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
very well between the two of us but
 
06:39:34.070 --> 06:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
instead we said you know we're going to
 
06:39:36.150 --> 06:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
do this i stayed home and we sent my
 
06:39:38.230 --> 06:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
husband off to law school so he was
 
06:39:40.708 --> 06:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
working full-time doing law school while
 
06:39:44.708 --> 06:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
i was at home homeschooling these kids
 
06:39:46.230 --> 06:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
so while we have the professional
 
06:39:48.708 --> 06:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
degrees and all we are all we have we
 
06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
have really worked for that and we are
 
06:39:52.310 --> 06:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
now on a budget
 
06:39:53.910 --> 06:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
always on a budget something to think
 
06:39:56.948 --> 06:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
about is that it takes a lot of time to
 
06:39:59.030 --> 06:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
be able to homeschool you're already
 
06:40:01.110 --> 06:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
sacrificing the one income and then it
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time to find used
 
06:40:06.548 --> 06:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
resources the the good the well-priced
 
06:40:09.750 --> 06:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
classes the you know the the
 
06:40:11.910 --> 06:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
my kids used the same notebooks since
 
06:40:13.990 --> 06:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
they were in kindergarten and the oldest
 
06:40:15.910 --> 06:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
one is 10. i literally bought new
 
06:40:18.150 --> 06:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
notebooks for the first time this year
 
06:40:19.830 --> 06:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
we just had bought a book pack and we
 
06:40:22.070 --> 06:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
used it you know because to us it was
 
06:40:23.430 --> 06:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
this important to give them the
 
06:40:25.910 --> 06:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
differentiated instruction especially
 
06:40:27.750 --> 06:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
having been a public school teacher all
 
06:40:30.390 --> 06:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
the more so i had found how restricted i
 
06:40:33.270 --> 06:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
was in trying to give the children that
 
06:40:36.390 --> 06:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
i really adored what they needed so i i
 
06:40:38.948 --> 06:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
you know i made those sacrifices so the
 
06:40:40.628 --> 06:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
children can do that
 
06:40:43.350 --> 06:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
now i i mean when this efa happened i
 
06:40:43.360 --> 06:40:44.150 align:start position:0%
now i i mean when this efa happened i
was

06:40:44.150 --> 06:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:40:46.788 --> 06:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
i was like oh my goodness you know for a
 
06:40:49.830 --> 06:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
fraction of the cost of one public
 
06:40:53.190 --> 06:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
school student these kids are thriving i
 
06:40:55.430 --> 06:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't able even though we do very well
 
06:40:57.110 --> 06:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
because we have five kids because the
 
06:40:58.868 --> 06:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
ways we did this because we have student
 
06:41:02.070 --> 06:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
loans and things i wasn't able to afford
 
06:41:03.830 --> 06:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
a computer and a printer so no i
 
06:41:06.548 --> 06:41:06.558 align:start position:0%
couldn't do online classes i couldn't
 
06:41:08.708 --> 06:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get the the free
 
06:41:11.110 --> 06:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
typing club class to go on the one
 
06:41:13.110 --> 06:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
little kindle we had like that didn't
 
06:41:16.230 --> 06:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
work you know and so now we have all
 
06:41:18.948 --> 06:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
these resources it didn't cost a lot it
 
06:41:20.948 --> 06:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
didn't cost a lot to the taxpayer and
 
06:41:23.110 --> 06:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
this will benefit the new hampshire
 
06:41:24.868 --> 06:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
taxpayer this will
 
06:41:27.590 --> 06:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
these kids will benefit new hampshire
 
06:41:29.830 --> 06:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
and this program will benefit new
 
06:41:33.030 --> 06:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire because it is allowing so many
 
06:41:34.548 --> 06:41:34.558 align:start position:0%
kids to thrive
 
06:41:34.558 --> 06:41:35.430 align:start position:0%

small amount
 
06:42:28.628 --> 06:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
it's everything we need to be able to
 
06:42:31.030 --> 06:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
give these children who will benefit
 
06:42:33.190 --> 06:42:33.200 align:start position:0%

hampshire's communities and our family

06:42:42.150 --> 06:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
benefit our community which we're very
 
06:42:45.510 --> 06:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
invested in and very involved in because
 
06:42:47.830 --> 06:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the efa supporting us and i want to
 
06:42:49.830 --> 06:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
make one more point which is that when
 
06:42:51.910 --> 06:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
you start homeschooling it's not very
 
06:42:54.628 --> 06:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
expensive a kindergartner does not need
 
06:42:56.390 --> 06:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
much you do a little reading you do a
 
06:42:57.910 --> 06:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
little writing you do a little math
 
06:42:59.430 --> 06:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
you're good to go
 
06:43:01.750 --> 06:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
but a 10 year old who's who's it who's
 
06:43:04.310 --> 06:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
fairly advanced in in several several
 
06:43:04.320 --> 06:43:05.830 align:start position:0%
fairly advanced in in several several
subjects

06:43:05.830 --> 06:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
subjects
 
06:43:07.990 --> 06:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
and an eight-year-old who's starting to
 
06:43:10.548 --> 06:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
explore things they need more so even if
 
06:43:12.230 --> 06:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
you have a home i've been in
 
06:43:14.788 --> 06:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
homeschooling the whole time
 
06:43:16.628 --> 06:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
it was starting to become almost
 
06:43:16.638 --> 06:43:17.910 align:start position:0%
it was starting to become almost
undoable

06:43:17.910 --> 06:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
undoable
 
06:43:20.150 --> 06:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
because as you go and you have more
 
06:43:23.190 --> 06:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
needs your financial needs get greater
 
06:43:26.070 --> 06:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
so the efa provided me something
 
06:43:27.990 --> 06:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
where i had no solution i wasn't sure
 
06:43:29.430 --> 06:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
what i was going to do
 
06:43:31.430 --> 06:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
and the kids love it next time i'll
 
06:43:33.350 --> 06:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
bring one she'll tell you
 
06:43:35.510 --> 06:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
06:43:36.628 --> 06:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
06:43:36.638 --> 06:43:38.390 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

06:43:38.390 --> 06:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:43:40.230 --> 06:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
yes represent woodcock i think i heard
 
06:43:42.070 --> 06:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
you correct after i think i heard you
 
06:43:43.670 --> 06:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
correctly i'll be sure he said your
 
06:43:45.110 --> 06:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
children were already being homeschooled
 
06:43:47.190 --> 06:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
prior to the program that's what i said
 
06:43:48.310 --> 06:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i could continue
 
06:43:51.830 --> 06:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
homeschooling them okay thank you
 
06:43:53.670 --> 06:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:43:57.590 --> 06:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:59.350 --> 06:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:43:59.360 --> 06:44:00.548 align:start position:0%
any other
parents

06:44:00.548 --> 06:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
parents
 
06:44:02.708 --> 06:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
yeah i know probably a lot of parents
 
06:44:03.830 --> 06:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
out there but
 
06:44:06.070 --> 06:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
that need to get home okay you put your
 
06:44:10.150 --> 06:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:12.310 --> 06:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is ali taylor my
 
06:44:14.390 --> 06:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
family and i live in manchester we are
 
06:44:17.430 --> 06:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers in manchester and we
 
06:44:19.990 --> 06:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
are in manchester school district
 
06:44:21.990 --> 06:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
we found it very interesting that both
 
06:44:23.430 --> 06:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
of the assistant principals of the
 
06:44:24.948 --> 06:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
public schools that our children have
 
06:44:26.868 --> 06:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
attended have had their own children in
 
06:44:28.628 --> 06:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
private school
 
06:44:30.948 --> 06:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's that that tells a lot
 
06:44:32.390 --> 06:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and hearing my
 
06:44:35.590 --> 06:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts today regarding hb 1683
 
06:44:37.270 --> 06:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's my strong belief in the live free
 
06:44:38.948 --> 06:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
or die state of new hampshire that the
 
06:44:41.270 --> 06:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
educational choices for children belong
 
06:44:42.628 --> 06:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
to their parents
 
06:44:45.190 --> 06:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
who better knows a child and his unique
 
06:44:47.270 --> 06:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
needs better than mom or dad
 
06:44:50.868 --> 06:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
as the mom of four boys ages 11 to 23
 
06:44:52.310 --> 06:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
our family has taken different
 
06:44:54.708 --> 06:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
educational approaches along the way
 
06:44:56.390 --> 06:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
our boys have attended public school
 
06:44:57.750 --> 06:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
private school and even been
 
06:44:59.750 --> 06:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
homeschooled early on but it hasn't
 
06:45:01.590 --> 06:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
always been easy providing
 
06:45:03.510 --> 06:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
a unique education that each of our
 
06:45:05.350 --> 06:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
children needed because our youngest
 
06:45:08.230 --> 06:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
child hudson was born in 2010 with a
 
06:45:10.390 --> 06:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
surprise diagnosis of down syndrome as
 
06:45:11.910 --> 06:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
well as autism
 
06:45:14.468 --> 06:45:14.478 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with autism a few years later
 
06:45:16.868 --> 06:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
so our lives drastically changed today
 
06:45:19.030 --> 06:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
hudson is non-verbal and incontinent at
 
06:45:21.350 --> 06:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
age 11 with several other medical
 
06:45:23.590 --> 06:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
diagnosis so i'm a full-time caregiver
 
06:45:25.750 --> 06:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
these days and while i initially
 
06:45:27.910 --> 06:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
homeschooled my older boys my caregiving
 
06:45:30.070 --> 06:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities do not allow me to
 
06:45:31.350 --> 06:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
continue that
 
06:45:32.868 --> 06:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
after initially trying the public
 
06:45:34.868 --> 06:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
schools and then doing some research we
 
06:45:36.548 --> 06:45:36.558 align:start position:0%
realized that private school was the
 
06:45:38.868 --> 06:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
right choice for our older boys
 
06:45:40.948 --> 06:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
unable to afford school tuition on one
 
06:45:42.868 --> 06:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
income with me at home with hudson we
 
06:45:45.270 --> 06:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
applied for private scholarships and i
 
06:45:47.830 --> 06:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
started a web-based company in 2014
 
06:45:49.670 --> 06:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
working nights for many years to earn
 
06:45:51.830 --> 06:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
tuition money for our kids it was
 
06:45:54.150 --> 06:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
exhausting working nights and caring for
 
06:45:56.150 --> 06:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
my son hudson during the day
 
06:45:58.070 --> 06:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
at that time our second youngest son
 
06:45:59.750 --> 06:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
charlie was still enrolled in our local
 
06:46:01.670 --> 06:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
public school and things were not going
 
06:46:01.680 --> 06:46:02.468 align:start position:0%
public school and things were not going
well

06:46:02.468 --> 06:46:02.478 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:46:04.708 --> 06:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
a very creative child he was bored and
 
06:46:06.708 --> 06:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
desperately needed a gifted and talented
 
06:46:08.310 --> 06:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
program that was not available in our
 
06:46:08.320 --> 06:46:09.350 align:start position:0%
program that was not available in our
district

06:46:09.350 --> 06:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:46:11.110 --> 06:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
we then moved him to a private school
 
06:46:12.708 --> 06:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
but it was a very tricky financial
 
06:46:14.548 --> 06:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
decision for our family
 
06:46:16.788 --> 06:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
so we you can imagine how ecstatic we
 
06:46:18.468 --> 06:46:18.478 align:start position:0%
were last august when the new hampshire
 
06:46:21.030 --> 06:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
legislature unanimously embraced the efa
 
06:46:23.830 --> 06:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
bill it changed our lives charlie is now
 
06:46:25.510 --> 06:46:25.520 align:start position:0%

have opened up for him last year he
 
06:46:34.230 --> 06:46:34.240 align:start position:0%

student teacher conferences in october i
 
06:53:24.230 --> 06:53:24.240 align:start position:0%

her teachers

participate or demonstrate in class
 
06:53:49.830 --> 06:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
evie is going to succeed not because of
 
06:53:52.150 --> 06:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
grades but because she has a desire to
 
06:53:54.230 --> 06:53:54.240 align:start position:0%

education more conductive to their

specific needs but will also take the
 
06:56:47.830 --> 06:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
pressure off public schools trying to
 
06:56:49.990 --> 06:56:50.000 align:start position:0%

more on mainstream education and improve
 
06:56:57.510 --> 06:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
areas of education they are already good
 
06:56:59.270 --> 06:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
at while private schools home schools
 
06:57:01.510 --> 06:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
etc can focus on meeting individual
 
06:57:04.070 --> 06:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
students more specific educational needs
 
06:57:05.590 --> 06:57:05.600 align:start position:0%

and the efa
 
06:58:21.430 --> 06:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
account has been what has tipped the
 
06:58:23.270 --> 06:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
scale to allow us to try that out to
 
06:58:24.468 --> 06:58:24.478 align:start position:0%
find the best
 
06:58:28.868 --> 06:58:28.878 align:start position:0%

doubt that they also provide a
 
06:58:36.390 --> 06:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate
 
06:58:38.070 --> 06:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
program and like many of the parents
 
06:58:40.390 --> 06:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
that you've heard today i seek out the
 
06:58:43.190 --> 06:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
best possible education for my children
 
06:58:43.200 --> 06:58:44.150 align:start position:0%
best possible education for my children
um

06:58:44.150 --> 06:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:46.628 --> 06:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
and i'm i was happy to find the efa
 
06:58:49.110 --> 06:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
program and the use of our tax dollars
 
06:58:50.310 --> 06:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
06:58:51.670 --> 06:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
to that end
 
06:58:53.590 --> 06:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
and to give the parent the choice to
 
06:58:55.030 --> 06:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
make that happen
 
06:58:55.040 --> 06:58:55.910 align:start position:0%
make that happen
um

06:58:55.910 --> 06:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:58.628 --> 06:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
so i would offer um
 
06:59:00.310 --> 06:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
maybe a middle of the road encouragement
 
06:59:03.190 --> 06:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
to you that if you choose to vote no
 
06:59:05.670 --> 06:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
um or if you choose to vote yes and
 
06:59:08.788 --> 06:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
repeal the fa program find a different
 
06:59:11.350 --> 06:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
better solution and quickly at least for
 
06:59:13.270 --> 06:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
my sake because i have a high schooler
 
06:59:15.350 --> 06:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
coming this next fall and i'm thoroughly
 
06:59:17.830 --> 06:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what to do with her
 
06:59:19.350 --> 06:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
that will find the best possible
 
06:59:21.510 --> 06:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
education when we'll send her the public
 
06:59:23.030 --> 06:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
school if we need to and it will be
 
06:59:24.788 --> 06:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate
 
06:59:27.110 --> 06:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
um but as a parent and i'm sure that
 
06:59:29.030 --> 06:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
many of you can resonate with this
 
06:59:30.310 --> 06:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not just searching for what's
 
06:59:33.910 --> 06:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
adequate i'm searching for what's best
 
06:59:36.628 --> 06:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
and so if if we don't have a quick and
 
06:59:39.190 --> 06:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
expedient solution that's better than
 
06:59:40.788 --> 06:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
the current program then i would implore
 
06:59:42.468 --> 06:59:42.478 align:start position:0%
you to keep the current program until
 
06:59:44.788 --> 06:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
you do
 
06:59:45.990 --> 06:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
for so many of the other people that
 
06:59:47.990 --> 06:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard today and for my kids as
 
06:59:49.990 --> 06:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
06:59:51.670 --> 06:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh looking at
 
06:59:53.830 --> 06:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
jacquard are you in support or in
 
06:59:55.990 --> 06:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill or neutral
 
06:59:57.910 --> 06:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of keeping the current
 
06:59:57.920 --> 06:59:59.110 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of keeping the current
program

06:59:59.110 --> 06:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
program
 
07:00:01.590 --> 07:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm in opposition of repealing the
 
07:00:03.590 --> 07:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
boat though okay so do you want me to
 
07:00:05.270 --> 07:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
change to them because you put yes if i
 
07:00:09.430 --> 07:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:11.510 --> 07:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome are there any
 
07:00:13.990 --> 07:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
07:00:15.350 --> 07:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much
 
07:00:17.670 --> 07:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
07:00:26.230 --> 07:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:27.830 --> 07:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm james wood from
 
07:00:31.030 --> 07:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
merrimack new hampshire and i support
 
07:00:32.868 --> 07:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
parents and whatever they want to do
 
07:00:34.868 --> 07:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
with their children
 
07:00:37.430 --> 07:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
as a taxpayer my wife and i both have no
 
07:00:37.440 --> 07:00:38.310 align:start position:0%
as a taxpayer my wife and i both have no
children

07:00:38.310 --> 07:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:00:39.830 --> 07:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
we've lived in the state for over 20
 
07:00:41.030 --> 07:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
years we
 
07:00:44.230 --> 07:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
i understand the need to send children
 
07:00:46.868 --> 07:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
to the best education possible
 
07:00:48.708 --> 07:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
i spent 22 years in the military travel
 
07:00:49.990 --> 07:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
around the world it's all lots of
 
07:00:52.070 --> 07:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
different peoples all different places
 
07:00:53.510 --> 07:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
and something's fundamentally wrong in
 
07:00:55.510 --> 07:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
our country when you start seeing us
 
07:00:57.750 --> 07:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
drop down around the world when you
 
07:00:59.910 --> 07:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
start looking at the educational levels
 
07:01:02.948 --> 07:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
of the kids coming from our high schools
 
07:01:04.788 --> 07:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
i saw it in the military
 
07:01:07.190 --> 07:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
i saw people coming without
 
07:01:07.200 --> 07:01:08.070 align:start position:0%
i saw people coming without
any

07:01:08.070 --> 07:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
07:01:10.788 --> 07:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
real fundamental values i don't know
 
07:01:12.708 --> 07:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
what it cost i don't know where it comes
 
07:01:14.868 --> 07:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
from whether it's in home or something
 
07:01:16.708 --> 07:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
in school but they're just something
 
07:01:16.718 --> 07:01:17.670 align:start position:0%
in school but they're just something
missing

07:01:17.670 --> 07:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
missing
 
07:01:20.468 --> 07:01:20.478 align:start position:0%
i support kids because i understood what
 
07:01:21.750 --> 07:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's like because i suffered from
 
07:01:23.830 --> 07:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
dyslexia for more than
 
07:01:26.230 --> 07:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
six years when i was growing up and
 
07:01:27.590 --> 07:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
teachers would
 
07:01:29.350 --> 07:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand and my mother was
 
07:01:32.230 --> 07:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
the only thing that i had to move
 
07:01:34.468 --> 07:01:34.478 align:start position:0%
forward because they were saying
 
07:01:36.468 --> 07:01:36.478 align:start position:0%
we don't know what to do with them
 
07:01:38.468 --> 07:01:38.478 align:start position:0%
we don't know what to do with them and i
 
07:01:40.230 --> 07:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
went from year to year but still pushed
 
07:01:42.468 --> 07:01:42.478 align:start position:0%
through the educational system until i
 
07:01:45.110 --> 07:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
got to fifth grade and uh teachers one
 
07:01:46.788 --> 07:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
teacher said
 
07:01:49.030 --> 07:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
this kid can't write his name
 
07:01:51.190 --> 07:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'd write letters backwards i could add
 
07:01:54.150 --> 07:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
or subtract because i was adding numbers
 
07:01:56.310 --> 07:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
because i thought a three was an eight
 
07:01:57.990 --> 07:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
or i saw things upside down and
 
07:02:00.468 --> 07:02:00.478 align:start position:0%
backwards i know what it's like to be
 
07:02:01.990 --> 07:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
one of those kids that gets pushed
 
07:02:04.150 --> 07:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
through the system and then that teacher
 
07:02:06.390 --> 07:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
said to my mom you need to get him some
 
07:02:06.400 --> 07:02:07.190 align:start position:0%
said to my mom you need to get him some
help

07:02:07.190 --> 07:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
help
 
07:02:08.868 --> 07:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
because things were going downhill
 
07:02:10.468 --> 07:02:10.478 align:start position:0%
relatively quick
 
07:02:13.190 --> 07:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
so my mother my father worked at ford
 
07:02:16.390 --> 07:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
plant making 95 a week and there was
 
07:02:18.868 --> 07:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
seven of us in the house so you tell me
 
07:02:21.030 --> 07:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
how my mom and dad were going to support
 
07:02:23.510 --> 07:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
sending me to special education my
 
07:02:26.468 --> 07:02:26.478 align:start position:0%
mother did all she could to take care of
 
07:02:29.190 --> 07:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
five kids and a guy that worked three
 
07:02:31.510 --> 07:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
jobs trying to make ends meet
 
07:02:33.430 --> 07:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
so i know what these parents are going
 
07:02:35.110 --> 07:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
through i know what it's like to be that
 
07:02:37.430 --> 07:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
kid sitting in that classroom being
 
07:02:39.030 --> 07:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
pushed through because
 
07:02:41.990 --> 07:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
we were in an expedited educational
 
07:02:43.750 --> 07:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
system we need to get you through we
 
07:02:45.350 --> 07:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
have a lot of kids in this class we
 
07:02:47.350 --> 07:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
don't have time to spend a lot of time
 
07:02:49.430 --> 07:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
with you and i understood that too i
 
07:02:51.110 --> 07:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
understand that now because i can see
 
07:02:51.120 --> 07:02:52.070 align:start position:0%
understand that now because i can see
that

07:02:52.070 --> 07:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:02:54.310 --> 07:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
but i tell you right now these
 
07:02:55.750 --> 07:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
educational savings accounts are
 
07:02:57.030 --> 07:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
important because you can see the
 
07:02:59.030 --> 07:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
families that are helping there's no
 
07:03:01.190 --> 07:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
better return of investment on our tax
 
07:03:03.990 --> 07:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
money than putting into these kids we
 
07:03:07.030 --> 07:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
can spend money on highways we can pop
 
07:03:09.670 --> 07:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
fix potholes but once these kids get
 
07:03:11.750 --> 07:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
through those grades they never gain the
 
07:03:13.670 --> 07:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
fundamental knowledge again that you
 
07:03:16.628 --> 07:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
miss by the early formative years the
 
07:03:19.270 --> 07:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
formative years are the most important
 
07:03:21.910 --> 07:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
building blocks to build their education
 
07:03:24.548 --> 07:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
so i stress everyone to think about when
 
07:03:27.030 --> 07:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
you're looking at money as money is a
 
07:03:27.040 --> 07:03:28.390 align:start position:0%
you're looking at money as money is a
sole

07:03:28.390 --> 07:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
sole
 
07:03:30.548 --> 07:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
driving factor for everything we need to
 
07:03:33.350 --> 07:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
find the money bank borrow steal
 
07:03:35.350 --> 07:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
whatever we have to do we need to find
 
07:03:36.788 --> 07:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
money and if there's a structural
 
07:03:39.510 --> 07:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
problem in the program between the house
 
07:03:41.990 --> 07:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the senate or the people in these we
 
07:03:43.430 --> 07:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
need to come together as a group and
 
07:03:45.750 --> 07:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
realize the things we're trying to do is
 
07:03:47.910 --> 07:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
what's best for the kids and best for
 
07:03:49.110 --> 07:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state of new hampshire
 
07:03:51.350 --> 07:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
because like they were saying we will
 
07:03:54.310 --> 07:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
benefit from these children far longer
 
07:03:55.590 --> 07:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be taking care
 
07:03:57.030 --> 07:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
of us but we can't take care of
 
07:03:59.750 --> 07:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves so if we don't equip them with
 
07:04:02.150 --> 07:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
all the tools that they need to we're in
 
07:04:04.230 --> 07:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
trouble as a society and you can see
 
07:04:06.150 --> 07:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
that now by how many homeless people
 
07:04:08.150 --> 07:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
there are who can't find jobs because
 
07:04:10.230 --> 07:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
they have no hope because a lot of them
 
07:04:13.110 --> 07:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't have any reason to have hope
 
07:04:15.190 --> 07:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm for structurally doing whatever
 
07:04:17.590 --> 07:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
we need to do to keep these kids
 
07:04:19.750 --> 07:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
in whatever they need to do whatever we
 
07:04:21.910 --> 07:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
07:04:23.510 --> 07:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from

my name is louise spencer i live in
 
07:04:51.830 --> 07:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
concord i'm co-founder of a group called

07:04:59.430 --> 07:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
group
 
07:05:00.788 --> 07:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
and i
 
07:05:02.628 --> 07:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
i'm very sympathetic to much of the
 
07:05:05.350 --> 07:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard today
 
07:05:07.670 --> 07:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
i have a daughter with dyslexia
 
07:05:08.948 --> 07:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
who had
 
07:05:11.910 --> 07:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
a great deal of challenges both
 
07:05:13.990 --> 07:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the public schools and in a private
 
07:05:14.000 --> 07:05:15.750 align:start position:0%
in the public schools and in a private
school

07:05:15.750 --> 07:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:05:16.708 --> 07:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
i think
 
07:05:16.718 --> 07:05:17.990 align:start position:0%
i think
that

07:05:17.990 --> 07:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:05:21.750 --> 07:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:23.910 --> 07:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
there can be challenges in finding the
 
07:05:26.628 --> 07:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
right match for for each child to the
 
07:05:29.030 --> 07:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
right education
 
07:05:31.510 --> 07:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
where i take issue is
 
07:05:33.670 --> 07:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
07:05:36.310 --> 07:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
we have not adequately funded
 
07:05:38.150 --> 07:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
the public schools and many of the
 
07:05:40.390 --> 07:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
problems that we hear
 
07:05:43.070 --> 07:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
being raised are ones that i would hope
 
07:05:43.080 --> 07:05:44.150 align:start position:0%
being raised are ones that i would hope
[Music]

07:05:44.150 --> 07:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:05:45.750 --> 07:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
could be
 
07:05:48.548 --> 07:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
addressed if schools had the adequate
 
07:05:50.948 --> 07:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
resources that they need
 
07:05:52.868 --> 07:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
07:05:55.190 --> 07:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
give each child the
 
07:05:57.910 --> 07:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
sort of education that can address
 
07:06:02.390 --> 07:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:02.400 --> 07:06:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
i

07:06:03.190 --> 07:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:06:04.628 --> 07:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
i do
 
07:06:07.110 --> 07:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
think that there is truth in the idea
 
07:06:07.120 --> 07:06:08.070 align:start position:0%
think that there is truth in the idea
that

07:06:08.070 --> 07:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:06:09.510 --> 07:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
we need to look at
 
07:06:11.590 --> 07:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
customer and i have to say that as a
 
07:06:15.270 --> 07:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:18.070 --> 07:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
i find it quite appalling that a program
 
07:06:20.310 --> 07:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
would have been estimated at costing us
 
07:06:22.468 --> 07:06:22.478 align:start position:0%
200 000
 
07:06:23.910 --> 07:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
or less
 
07:06:25.750 --> 07:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
and that it's run up
 
07:06:28.708 --> 07:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
to 8 million and counting
 
07:06:30.548 --> 07:06:30.558 align:start position:0%
with a 6 000
 
07:06:32.548 --> 07:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
cost overrun
 
07:06:34.628 --> 07:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
now it could be
 
07:06:34.638 --> 07:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
now it could be
that

07:06:35.990 --> 07:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:06:38.230 --> 07:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
the state decides that that's how we
 
07:06:40.468 --> 07:06:40.478 align:start position:0%
should be spending our money
 
07:06:42.948 --> 07:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
the problem i have here is that we never
 
07:06:45.830 --> 07:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
decided that and that was never reviewed
 
07:06:47.990 --> 07:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
this program never went through finance
 
07:06:48.000 --> 07:06:49.030 align:start position:0%
this program never went through finance
committee

07:06:49.030 --> 07:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:06:50.868 --> 07:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
it never was really considered what the
 
07:06:52.948 --> 07:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
true costs of this program were going to
 
07:06:52.958 --> 07:06:54.230 align:start position:0%
true costs of this program were going to
be

07:06:54.230 --> 07:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:06:57.750 --> 07:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
it was never looked at what might be
 
07:07:01.750 --> 07:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate alternatives to this program
 
07:07:03.030 --> 07:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
07:07:03.040 --> 07:07:04.070 align:start position:0%
and so
i

07:07:04.070 --> 07:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:07:06.230 --> 07:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know it may be that it represents a
 
07:07:06.240 --> 07:07:07.190 align:start position:0%
you know it may be that it represents a
certain

07:07:07.190 --> 07:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
certain
 
07:07:09.110 --> 07:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
interest in the program
 
07:07:09.120 --> 07:07:09.910 align:start position:0%
interest in the program
but

07:07:09.910 --> 07:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:07:11.510 --> 07:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
as taxpayers
 
07:07:13.590 --> 07:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
and i would think every granite stater
 
07:07:15.350 --> 07:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
would want
 
07:07:15.360 --> 07:07:16.628 align:start position:0%
would want
the

07:07:16.628 --> 07:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:07:20.230 --> 07:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
legislature to do its due diligence
 
07:07:22.788 --> 07:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
and reviewing a program and the two the
 
07:07:25.910 --> 07:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
true costs that a program will have
 
07:07:28.628 --> 07:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
in the context of the money that we have
 
07:07:31.510 --> 07:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
available to fund education public
 
07:07:31.520 --> 07:07:33.110 align:start position:0%
available to fund education public
education

07:07:33.110 --> 07:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
07:07:35.590 --> 07:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
overall as a state and i really take
 
07:07:37.430 --> 07:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
issue with the fact that that was never
 
07:07:40.548 --> 07:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
done with this program
 
07:07:45.110 --> 07:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
so i also i just want to point out that
 
07:07:48.150 --> 07:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
there are many people who are
 
07:07:50.788 --> 07:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
paying attention to this bill
 
07:07:52.788 --> 07:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
and lots of reasons that many of them
 
07:07:55.030 --> 07:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
could not be here today
 
07:07:57.190 --> 07:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
some of that has to do with covid and
 
07:07:58.468 --> 07:07:58.478 align:start position:0%
whether people
 
07:08:00.310 --> 07:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
are feeling comfortable being in a
 
07:08:03.830 --> 07:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
smaller closed environment
 
07:08:05.670 --> 07:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
others have to do with people working
 
07:08:07.270 --> 07:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
teachers for example who are in the
 
07:08:07.280 --> 07:08:08.468 align:start position:0%
teachers for example who are in the
classroom

07:08:08.468 --> 07:08:08.478 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
07:08:10.628 --> 07:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
students who are in the classroom
 
07:08:13.350 --> 07:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
others who can't travel due to
 
07:08:17.350 --> 07:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities or lack of transportation
 
07:08:17.360 --> 07:08:18.390 align:start position:0%
disabilities or lack of transportation
so

07:08:18.390 --> 07:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:08:22.070 --> 07:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
i would like to point out a few things
 
07:08:26.468 --> 07:08:26.478 align:start position:0%
one is that if you go on to the um
 
07:08:29.110 --> 07:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
onto the record
 
07:08:31.030 --> 07:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
where the public testimonies can be
 
07:08:31.040 --> 07:08:32.548 align:start position:0%
where the public testimonies can be
submitted

07:08:32.548 --> 07:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
07:08:34.070 --> 07:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
we find that
 
07:08:34.080 --> 07:08:35.830 align:start position:0%
we find that
911

07:08:35.830 --> 07:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
911
 
07:08:39.270 --> 07:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
people as of just a few moments ago
 
07:08:40.708 --> 07:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
signed in
 
07:08:43.270 --> 07:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill
 
07:08:45.430 --> 07:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
if you take into account the additional
 
07:08:48.788 --> 07:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
ones that signed in on the blue sheets
 
07:08:51.190 --> 07:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
that adds
 
07:08:52.830 --> 07:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
that comes to
 
07:08:54.708 --> 07:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
917 people
 
07:08:57.190 --> 07:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
07:09:00.310 --> 07:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
if you then look at those opposed signed
 
07:09:00.320 --> 07:09:01.310 align:start position:0%
if you then look at those opposed signed
in

07:09:01.310 --> 07:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:09:04.150 --> 07:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
204 opposed
 
07:09:08.548 --> 07:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
plus on the sheets 30 so that's 230
 
07:09:08.558 --> 07:09:09.430 align:start position:0%
plus on the sheets 30 so that's 230
people

07:09:09.430 --> 07:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:09:12.708 --> 07:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill
 
07:09:14.868 --> 07:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
there were 33
 
07:09:17.750 --> 07:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
testimonies submitted online
 
07:09:20.150 --> 07:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
27 in support
 
07:09:20.160 --> 07:09:21.190 align:start position:0%
27 in support
and

07:09:21.190 --> 07:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:09:23.110 --> 07:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
six opposed
 
07:09:25.190 --> 07:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
we heard today
 
07:09:28.628 --> 07:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
16 testimonies in support again thank
 
07:09:30.868 --> 07:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
you much of it very powerful
 
07:09:34.708 --> 07:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:37.990 --> 07:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
in support did i say 16 we heard today
 
07:09:38.000 --> 07:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
in support did i say 16 we heard today
um

07:09:39.030 --> 07:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:41.270 --> 07:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill and then
 
07:09:41.280 --> 07:09:42.468 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill and then
four

07:09:42.468 --> 07:09:42.478 align:start position:0%
four
 
07:09:45.590 --> 07:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
um in support of the bill
 
07:09:48.070 --> 07:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
so that brings it to 31 total
 
07:09:51.750 --> 07:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
testimonies in support and 22 opposed
 
07:09:54.468 --> 07:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important that we
 
07:09:57.030 --> 07:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are many many
 
07:09:58.548 --> 07:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
granite staters
 
07:10:01.030 --> 07:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
who for a variety of reasons
 
07:10:04.150 --> 07:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill i appreciate
 
07:10:06.548 --> 07:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the last gentleman
 
07:10:09.190 --> 07:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
about you know can we come together and
 
07:10:11.750 --> 07:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
try to find solutions to meet the needs
 
07:10:13.830 --> 07:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
of all of our children
 
07:10:17.110 --> 07:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
across the state i think that's
 
07:10:20.310 --> 07:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:20.320 --> 07:10:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
but

07:10:21.510 --> 07:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:10:23.750 --> 07:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now
 
07:10:25.670 --> 07:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
with this legislature
 
07:10:27.750 --> 07:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
choosing not to
 
07:10:29.190 --> 07:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
put money
 
07:10:31.510 --> 07:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
that would fund an adequate education
 
07:10:34.548 --> 07:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
for every child attending public school
 
07:10:39.110 --> 07:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
i think we need to err on the side of
 
07:10:40.868 --> 07:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
repealing this bill
 
07:10:42.708 --> 07:10:42.718 align:start position:0%
which is currently
 
07:10:44.628 --> 07:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
taking money away from the public
 
07:10:47.190 --> 07:10:47.200 align:start position:0%

god my lord and savior jesus christ but
 
07:11:43.190 --> 07:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
i guess he was
 
07:11:45.510 --> 07:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
represented a little bit
 
07:11:47.590 --> 07:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know when you take god out of the
 
07:11:52.468 --> 07:11:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:54.070 --> 07:11:54.080 align:start position:0%

speak ye every man the truth to his
neighbor

07:12:07.110 --> 07:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
neighbor
 
07:12:09.670 --> 07:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
execute the judgment of truth and peace
 
07:12:11.510 --> 07:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
in your gates

hearts against his neighbor and love no
 
07:12:17.270 --> 07:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
false oath
 
07:12:19.670 --> 07:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
for all these things are things that i
 
07:12:22.468 --> 07:12:22.478 align:start position:0%
hate saith the lord
 
07:12:24.948 --> 07:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
we're created beings we're i don't know
 
07:12:26.788 --> 07:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
what you know i don't know what the
 
07:12:26.798 --> 07:12:27.910 align:start position:0%
what you know i don't know what the
schools

07:12:27.910 --> 07:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
schools
 
07:12:29.430 --> 07:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
teach because
 
07:12:30.548 --> 07:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
i think
 
07:12:33.110 --> 07:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
the reason i have sanity is i didn't pay
 
07:12:34.788 --> 07:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
attention in school
 
07:12:36.708 --> 07:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
i didn't understand it it didn't make
 
07:12:38.788 --> 07:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
sense i didn't pay attention
 
07:12:41.510 --> 07:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
and that's my saving grace and and
 
07:12:42.788 --> 07:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
nothing too
 
07:12:44.468 --> 07:12:44.478 align:start position:0%
it's good to learn
 
07:12:47.430 --> 07:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
but when we first came over
 
07:12:49.670 --> 07:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
from another country
 
07:12:52.468 --> 07:12:52.478 align:start position:0%
we learned from the bible
 
07:12:55.190 --> 07:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's not religion jesus christ is not
 
07:12:58.150 --> 07:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
religion he's a relationship
 
07:12:58.160 --> 07:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
religion he's a relationship
and

07:12:59.750 --> 07:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:13:02.708 --> 07:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
you know it said in the end times
 
07:13:05.030 --> 07:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'll use
 
07:13:06.708 --> 07:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
the bad will get better and the good
 
07:13:08.708 --> 07:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
will get gooder and that's not very good
 
07:13:11.110 --> 07:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
grammar but this is what's going on this
 
07:13:11.120 --> 07:13:12.390 align:start position:0%
grammar but this is what's going on this
madness

07:13:12.390 --> 07:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
madness
 
07:13:16.070 --> 07:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
going on um in in this world and
 
07:13:17.750 --> 07:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
if we put
 
07:13:19.430 --> 07:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
god first
 
07:13:21.510 --> 07:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
our neighbor is ourself we wouldn't be
 
07:13:21.520 --> 07:13:22.390 align:start position:0%
our neighbor is ourself we wouldn't be
here

07:13:22.390 --> 07:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:13:23.670 --> 07:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
i thank you
 
07:13:26.708 --> 07:13:26.718 align:start position:0%

walter

07:13:33.750 --> 07:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:37.670 --> 07:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:41.110 --> 07:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:45.190 --> 07:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
speak today but after listening to um
 
07:13:47.430 --> 07:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
young girls from the prenda program and
 
07:13:49.270 --> 07:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
other homeschoolers i
 
07:13:50.868 --> 07:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
felt that i
 
07:13:52.310 --> 07:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
had to kind of weigh in a little bit
 
07:13:52.320 --> 07:13:53.270 align:start position:0%
had to kind of weigh in a little bit
here

07:13:53.270 --> 07:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:13:57.190 --> 07:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:59.190 --> 07:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
a couple of testimonies ago this woman
 
07:14:00.628 --> 07:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
07:14:02.948 --> 07:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
public school system needed more money
 
07:14:04.150 --> 07:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know it seems like it's always about
 
07:14:05.750 --> 07:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
money money money money just get much
 
07:14:08.310 --> 07:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
money as we can right now
 
07:14:10.788 --> 07:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
i think roughly 20 000 per student is
 
07:14:12.310 --> 07:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
being spent through the public school
 
07:14:12.320 --> 07:14:14.070 align:start position:0%
being spent through the public school
system

07:14:14.070 --> 07:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:14:16.230 --> 07:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
these alternatives
 
07:14:18.548 --> 07:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
systems are looking for a little bit of
 
07:14:21.670 --> 07:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
money you know if just the money
 
07:14:23.030 --> 07:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
would follow the students that would
 
07:14:25.590 --> 07:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
take care of all the money needs
 
07:14:27.910 --> 07:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know um public schools
 
07:14:30.390 --> 07:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
from what i've heard today are not doing
 
07:14:32.628 --> 07:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
a real bang-up job
 
07:14:33.990 --> 07:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
i mean there's going to be amazing kids
 
07:14:36.788 --> 07:14:36.798 align:start position:0%
could be coming out of these uh
 
07:14:38.230 --> 07:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and
 
07:14:41.830 --> 07:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:44.390 --> 07:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
i you know i oppose this this nonsense
 
07:14:45.830 --> 07:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
bill to take
 
07:14:49.430 --> 07:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
money of choice and freedom away from
 
07:14:51.110 --> 07:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
from you know parents
 
07:14:53.750 --> 07:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
and also these numbers that this one
 
07:14:55.590 --> 07:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
person came up with
 
07:14:57.430 --> 07:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
writings and whatnot
 
07:14:59.590 --> 07:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
whatever i mean that means nothing
 
07:15:01.190 --> 07:15:01.200 align:start position:0%

however i am one of
 
07:15:59.350 --> 07:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
the luckier people who was diagnosed
 
07:16:01.270 --> 07:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
with it i've had
 
07:16:03.510 --> 07:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
more opportunities than

was who got expelled from his school
 
07:16:40.788 --> 07:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
because he couldn't cope with it
 
07:16:43.990 --> 07:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
as someone who's a neurotypical person
 
07:16:45.830 --> 07:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
could and
 
07:16:48.948 --> 07:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
as you know someone with the same brain
 
07:16:50.548 --> 07:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
difference as him it's really important
 
07:16:52.788 --> 07:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
to me that other children
 
07:16:55.510 --> 07:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
get to have the opportunity to have the
 
07:16:59.510 --> 07:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
education that benefits them and doesn't
 
07:17:01.510 --> 07:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
exclude them because of their brain
 
07:17:01.520 --> 07:17:03.190 align:start position:0%
exclude them because of their brain
differences

07:17:03.190 --> 07:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
differences
 
07:17:04.788 --> 07:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
i know for a fact that i wouldn't have
 
07:17:07.110 --> 07:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
survived public school i wouldn't have
 
07:17:09.190 --> 07:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
learned anything and i probably would
 
07:17:10.948 --> 07:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
have gotten thrown out because i
 
07:17:13.590 --> 07:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't have coped with it
 
07:17:16.868 --> 07:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
i know several other friends of mine
 
07:17:18.548 --> 07:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
three of my best friends in fact have
 
07:17:21.190 --> 07:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
been through the public school system
 
07:17:23.270 --> 07:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
all three of them they were bullied and
 
07:17:26.070 --> 07:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
some of them now struggle with
 
07:17:28.310 --> 07:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
mental health problems because of like
 
07:17:31.270 --> 07:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
the lousy job that public school did for
 
07:17:31.280 --> 07:17:33.350 align:start position:0%
the lousy job that public school did for
them

07:17:33.350 --> 07:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
07:17:33.360 --> 07:17:36.230 align:start position:0%
them
so

07:17:36.230 --> 07:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:39.350 --> 07:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
i beg of you please do not pass this
 
07:17:42.070 --> 07:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill by doing so you would be do mean
 
07:17:44.388 --> 07:17:44.398 align:start position:0%
hundreds of kids like me
 
07:17:46.868 --> 07:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
to the oppressive education system that
 
07:17:48.788 --> 07:17:48.798 align:start position:0%
is public school
 
07:17:51.190 --> 07:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
07:17:53.270 --> 07:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming this afternoon
 
07:17:54.948 --> 07:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
we really appreciate it
 
07:17:56.948 --> 07:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
are there any comments from the
 
07:17:58.788 --> 07:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
07:18:01.030 --> 07:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
now thank you so much
 
07:18:03.910 --> 07:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:10.230 --> 07:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:11.750 --> 07:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
hi thanks for having me today i'm going
 
07:18:14.070 --> 07:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
to make this fast since it's way later
 
07:18:17.190 --> 07:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
than i expected my name is mari
 
07:18:19.270 --> 07:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
i live in manchester um i have a 10 year
 
07:18:21.510 --> 07:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
old son that loves to learn like many
 
07:18:23.110 --> 07:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
families the past two years have been
 
07:18:24.708 --> 07:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult for our son and his
 
07:18:27.110 --> 07:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
education we had to make big changes on
 
07:18:28.628 --> 07:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
how we supported him in and out of
 
07:18:28.638 --> 07:18:29.750 align:start position:0%
how we supported him in and out of
school

07:18:29.750 --> 07:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:18:32.548 --> 07:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
when the pandemic happened he was in
 
07:18:34.628 --> 07:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
he was in a private school
 
07:18:37.110 --> 07:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
but everything went remote and i was
 
07:18:38.868 --> 07:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
building decks with my husband for our
 
07:18:40.788 --> 07:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
construction company
 
07:18:43.030 --> 07:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
so it was like a really hard situation i
 
07:18:45.910 --> 07:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
had to bring my son to the job site um
 
07:18:48.230 --> 07:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
the clients were getting upset
 
07:18:50.150 --> 07:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
it was really difficult i had to stop
 
07:18:52.628 --> 07:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
working um
 
07:18:55.350 --> 07:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
so having education freedom accounts was
 
07:18:57.110 --> 07:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
something that offered support for
 
07:18:58.708 --> 07:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
families like ours that were struggling
 
07:19:01.750 --> 07:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
to provide the best opportunities
 
07:19:03.990 --> 07:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
public school system was not working at
 
07:19:07.190 --> 07:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
the time they're also remote and
 
07:19:08.548 --> 07:19:08.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of what i was seeing happen in the
 
07:19:10.628 --> 07:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
public schools don't align with our
 
07:19:12.468 --> 07:19:12.478 align:start position:0%
values and
 
07:19:14.388 --> 07:19:14.398 align:start position:0%
i was really dismayed at seeing some of
 
07:19:17.670 --> 07:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
the low test scores large class sizes so
 
07:19:20.070 --> 07:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
once i stopped working
 
07:19:22.230 --> 07:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
we really really took a lot of time to
 
07:19:23.590 --> 07:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
like find the best opportunities we
 
07:19:24.948 --> 07:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
could for our son
 
07:19:26.868 --> 07:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
so that he could still have a normal
 
07:19:28.548 --> 07:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
life during everything that was
 
07:19:28.558 --> 07:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
life during everything that was
happening

07:19:29.510 --> 07:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
happening
 
07:19:31.510 --> 07:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
so we can't
 
07:19:33.750 --> 07:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
he's he's doing so great like i can't
 
07:19:35.830 --> 07:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
imagine like going back
 
07:19:38.150 --> 07:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
and you know putting him in a situation
 
07:19:40.070 --> 07:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
he's thriving right now so
 
07:19:42.868 --> 07:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
um i oppose bill 1683 and i thank you
 
07:19:45.270 --> 07:19:45.280 align:start position:0%

wing
 
07:20:15.590 --> 07:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i um
 
07:20:17.190 --> 07:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
i have five children
 
07:20:19.110 --> 07:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
three of whom are using the efa right
 
07:20:20.708 --> 07:20:20.718 align:start position:0%
now and i couldn't be happier with their
 
07:20:23.190 --> 07:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
progress my son in particular
 
07:20:25.190 --> 07:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's nothing short of a miracle how far
 
07:20:26.548 --> 07:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
he's come and we were late going into
 
07:20:28.708 --> 07:20:28.718 align:start position:0%
the school year i had been homeschooling
 
07:20:31.270 --> 07:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
um and i did that because of the public
 
07:20:33.350 --> 07:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
school was not working especially for my
 
07:20:33.360 --> 07:20:34.548 align:start position:0%
school was not working especially for my
son

07:20:34.548 --> 07:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
son
 
07:20:37.510 --> 07:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
so it definitely changed our income i've
 
07:20:39.670 --> 07:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
had to cut back so i i really think the
 
07:20:42.788 --> 07:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
efa is going to be a win-win overall for
 
07:20:45.350 --> 07:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers i really believe that because
 
07:20:47.670 --> 07:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
as soon as my last child god willing
 
07:20:49.030 --> 07:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
gets into
 
07:20:50.468 --> 07:20:50.478 align:start position:0%
on the school that we have the children
 
07:20:52.948 --> 07:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
and now i will be able to return to work
 
07:20:55.190 --> 07:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
in a more full-time capacity
 
07:20:57.990 --> 07:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
um but i just i didn't want to lose my
 
07:20:59.430 --> 07:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
children you know i didn't want to lose
 
07:21:01.190 --> 07:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
my son
 
07:21:02.628 --> 07:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
in a school that wasn't working for him
 
07:21:04.388 --> 07:21:04.398 align:start position:0%
at the time and now he is attending a
 
07:21:06.788 --> 07:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
private school thanks to the efa and it
 
07:21:08.230 --> 07:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
just supplements what we're able to
 
07:21:09.910 --> 07:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
bring to the table and
 
07:21:12.150 --> 07:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
make it so that he is able to attend um
 
07:21:14.150 --> 07:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
and again we just couldn't be happier
 
07:21:16.628 --> 07:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to bring out that um
 
07:21:18.388 --> 07:21:18.398 align:start position:0%
and i have shared this before with some
 
07:21:20.788 --> 07:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
of the members here um
 
07:21:22.788 --> 07:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
that as a teen i actually went to live
 
07:21:25.190 --> 07:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
with my grandmother and aunt for several
 
07:21:25.200 --> 07:21:26.070 align:start position:0%
with my grandmother and aunt for several
years

07:21:26.070 --> 07:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:21:27.510 --> 07:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
away from my parents because they
 
07:21:28.948 --> 07:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford to put me in a private
 
07:21:30.948 --> 07:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
school and i was being bullied in
 
07:21:33.910 --> 07:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:35.990 --> 07:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
of their residence and so i was able to
 
07:21:37.990 --> 07:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
attend another public school but i had
 
07:21:39.830 --> 07:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
to be away from my family my immediate
 
07:21:42.070 --> 07:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
family for a number of years
 
07:21:44.150 --> 07:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
and that did benefit me you know but i
 
07:21:45.750 --> 07:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
did miss my parents of course it wasn't
 
07:21:48.948 --> 07:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
ideal so i just thank you for these efas
 
07:21:50.708 --> 07:21:50.718 align:start position:0%
they've empowered me to be the mother
 
07:21:50.718 --> 07:21:51.750 align:start position:0%
they've empowered me to be the mother
that

07:21:51.750 --> 07:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:21:54.070 --> 07:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
i've wanted to be i and
 
07:21:55.670 --> 07:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
they've just it's just changed our
 
07:21:58.468 --> 07:21:58.478 align:start position:0%
family the the positive ripple effect is
 
07:21:58.478 --> 07:21:59.430 align:start position:0%
family the the positive ripple effect is
just

07:21:59.430 --> 07:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:22:01.350 --> 07:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's awesome my husband has been able to
 
07:22:03.270 --> 07:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
attend nursing school we've had more
 
07:22:04.788 --> 07:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
money so we're not going in the red with
 
07:22:07.990 --> 07:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
him in school and we expect him to
 
07:22:10.388 --> 07:22:10.398 align:start position:0%
uh be a nurse at the end of the year
 
07:22:13.110 --> 07:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see that the bigger picture
 
07:22:15.350 --> 07:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
is it's really helping families overall
 
07:22:16.708 --> 07:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
not just with the education of the
 
07:22:19.110 --> 07:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
children but financially
 
07:22:20.948 --> 07:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
um so i plead with you please keep these
 
07:22:22.628 --> 07:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
efas alive
 
07:22:25.990 --> 07:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh they're making a big difference for
 
07:22:28.150 --> 07:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
these families thank you so much
 
07:22:29.830 --> 07:22:29.840 align:start position:0%

and
 
07:24:15.670 --> 07:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
to our horror we found out
 
07:24:16.830 --> 07:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
that the
 
07:24:16.840 --> 07:24:18.468 align:start position:0%

school
 
07:24:20.868 --> 07:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
excuse me the school psychologist used
 
07:24:22.708 --> 07:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
to work for that
 
07:24:22.718 --> 07:24:24.230 align:start position:0%

07:24:25.670 --> 07:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:24:28.388 --> 07:24:28.398 align:start position:0%
because he did not like her
 
07:24:29.910 --> 07:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
our daughter
 
07:24:34.310 --> 07:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
and her qualified plan were dismissed
 
07:24:36.468 --> 07:24:36.478 align:start position:0%
he directed her
 
07:24:38.548 --> 07:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
student her teachers
 
07:24:41.350 --> 07:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
and her fellow students to pull her out
 
07:24:44.388 --> 07:24:44.398 align:start position:0%
of her shell by calling on her
 
07:24:47.430 --> 07:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
every opportunity
 
07:24:49.750 --> 07:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
she stopped going to school
 
07:24:52.468 --> 07:24:52.478 align:start position:0%
we asked for a meeting
 
07:24:55.190 --> 07:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
at the meeting we were told there's no
 
07:24:58.628 --> 07:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
way we're not going to do it
 
07:25:05.190 --> 07:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:08.468 --> 07:25:08.478 align:start position:0%
the uniform officer the uniformed
 
07:25:11.110 --> 07:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
officer sitting in the room
 
07:25:13.750 --> 07:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
came to us
 
07:25:15.590 --> 07:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
afterward and
 
07:25:19.430 --> 07:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
offered some friendly advice
 
07:25:21.110 --> 07:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
your daughter will be
 
07:25:24.788 --> 07:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
16 in a couple of days
 
07:25:26.788 --> 07:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
withdraw her
 
07:25:31.030 --> 07:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
and we won't have to come arrest you
 
07:25:32.388 --> 07:25:32.398 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
07:25:34.708 --> 07:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
was too sick
 
07:25:37.350 --> 07:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
with agent orange induced the lymphoma
 
07:25:40.948 --> 07:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
the first of several different cancers
 
07:25:40.958 --> 07:25:42.788 align:start position:0%
the first of several different cancers
to

07:25:42.788 --> 07:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:25:42.798 --> 07:25:43.670 align:start position:0%
to
fight

07:25:43.670 --> 07:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
fight
 
07:25:45.990 --> 07:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
we had no money for
 
07:25:48.788 --> 07:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
professional lawyers who would be able
 
07:25:48.798 --> 07:25:49.990 align:start position:0%
professional lawyers who would be able
to

07:25:49.990 --> 07:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:25:53.190 --> 07:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
rebut what was being done
 
07:25:55.190 --> 07:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
instead we did our best
 
07:25:59.510 --> 07:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
we taught her to teach herself
 
07:25:59.520 --> 07:26:00.788 align:start position:0%
we taught her to teach herself
when

07:26:00.788 --> 07:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
when
 
07:26:00.798 --> 07:26:01.750 align:start position:0%
when
her

07:26:01.750 --> 07:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
her
 
07:26:05.510 --> 07:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
fellow classmates graduated she
 
07:26:08.230 --> 07:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
was discouraged so she went down and
 
07:26:08.240 --> 07:26:09.430 align:start position:0%
was discouraged so she went down and
tested

07:26:09.430 --> 07:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
tested
 
07:26:12.788 --> 07:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:14.868 --> 07:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
when she got her results
 
07:26:17.190 --> 07:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
she felt a little redeemed she did not
 
07:26:20.388 --> 07:26:20.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:20.398 --> 07:26:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
after

07:26:21.910 --> 07:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
after
 
07:26:25.910 --> 07:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:30.230 --> 07:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
she found out that her own teaching
 
07:26:33.990 --> 07:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
of herself had resulted in this
 
07:26:37.350 --> 07:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
she missed by three points
 
07:26:39.590 --> 07:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
in one
 
07:26:41.430 --> 07:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
the mathematics
 
07:26:42.868 --> 07:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
on the rest
 
07:26:44.468 --> 07:26:44.478 align:start position:0%
she maxed
 
07:26:47.190 --> 07:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:47.200 --> 07:26:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
today

07:26:49.190 --> 07:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:26:52.788 --> 07:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
she still struggles with shyness
 
07:26:55.110 --> 07:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
she's an excellent person
 
07:26:58.388 --> 07:26:58.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:03.510 --> 07:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
the system doesn't work for every child
 
07:27:05.750 --> 07:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
it can't
 
07:27:08.468 --> 07:27:08.478 align:start position:0%
there needs to be
 
07:27:08.478 --> 07:27:09.350 align:start position:0%
there needs to be
some

07:27:09.350 --> 07:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
some
 
07:27:09.360 --> 07:27:11.830 align:start position:0%
some
mechanism

07:27:11.830 --> 07:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
07:27:15.030 --> 07:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
because the law says
 
07:27:17.350 --> 07:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
what the law says
 
07:27:20.708 --> 07:27:20.718 align:start position:0%
and the results we give the children
 
07:27:24.468 --> 07:27:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:25.670 --> 07:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
we can
 
07:27:29.910 --> 07:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
do better this is a first step
 
07:27:32.468 --> 07:27:32.478 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions
 
07:27:33.990 --> 07:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much michael michael are
 
07:27:37.270 --> 07:27:37.280 align:start position:0%

07:27:38.948 --> 07:27:38.958 align:start position:0%
are you in opposition to the bill you've

written down here that you i asked to
 
07:27:44.310 --> 07:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
you to strike that word at the end
 
07:27:46.388 --> 07:27:46.398 align:start position:0%
it is obvious
 
07:27:49.110 --> 07:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
that our family
 
07:27:50.468 --> 07:27:50.478 align:start position:0%
would have
 
07:27:52.788 --> 07:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
benefited greatly
 
07:27:56.628 --> 07:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
by the current state of affairs
 
07:27:59.990 --> 07:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
and we would welcome it remaining
 
07:28:03.350 --> 07:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you please then correct that
 
07:28:06.230 --> 07:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:11.190 --> 07:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:13.830 --> 07:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
kelly you'd down uh
 
07:28:16.150 --> 07:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
ten minutes said you know can you cut it
 
07:28:18.150 --> 07:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
a little short please
 
07:28:22.708 --> 07:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:22.718 --> 07:28:23.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:28:23.670 --> 07:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:28:26.788 --> 07:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for having um
 
07:28:28.628 --> 07:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
spent your afternoon listening to all
 
07:28:30.788 --> 07:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
this testimony um
 
07:28:33.270 --> 07:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's so so important
 
07:28:33.280 --> 07:28:34.948 align:start position:0%
it's so so important
um

07:28:34.948 --> 07:28:34.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:28:36.548 --> 07:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
i brought my children with me but in a
 
07:28:38.548 --> 07:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
different format because no way would
 
07:28:42.150 --> 07:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
they sit this one so um
 
07:28:43.830 --> 07:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
you've seen these pages before some of
 
07:28:46.948 --> 07:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:46.958 --> 07:28:49.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

07:28:49.590 --> 07:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:51.110 --> 07:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
since the last time i spoke in front of
 
07:28:52.548 --> 07:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
the education committee i've actually
 
07:28:55.350 --> 07:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with my youngest
 
07:28:57.830 --> 07:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
son's kindergarten teacher where they're
 
07:29:02.070 --> 07:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting occupational therapy for him
 
07:29:04.230 --> 07:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
we suffer from a
 
07:29:04.240 --> 07:29:06.468 align:start position:0%
we suffer from a
congenital

07:29:06.468 --> 07:29:06.478 align:start position:0%
congenital
 
07:29:08.628 --> 07:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
disorder it's a connective tissue
 
07:29:11.030 --> 07:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
disorder where your
 
07:29:13.430 --> 07:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know ligaments and tendons don't
 
07:29:14.468 --> 07:29:14.478 align:start position:0%
quite work
 
07:29:16.150 --> 07:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
and what that leads to is
 
07:29:18.628 --> 07:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
low muscle tone so we have to work twice
 
07:29:21.430 --> 07:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
as hard to get half as far
 
07:29:24.468 --> 07:29:24.478 align:start position:0%
so when that comes to writing your
 
07:29:27.990 --> 07:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
body isn't properly aligned you're not
 
07:29:30.310 --> 07:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
able to sit up very well
 
07:29:33.110 --> 07:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
and that happens to my oldest as well so
 
07:29:36.388 --> 07:29:36.398 align:start position:0%
they need additional support that is not
 
07:29:39.030 --> 07:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
the only support they need
 
07:29:40.948 --> 07:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
my oldest has been diagnosed with
 
07:29:46.628 --> 07:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:48.468 --> 07:29:48.478 align:start position:0%
two specific learning disabilities one
 
07:29:50.070 --> 07:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
i'm reading one in written
 
07:29:52.708 --> 07:29:52.718 align:start position:0%
expression he also has adhd sensory
 
07:29:55.350 --> 07:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
processing disorder so he brings to
 
07:29:57.990 --> 07:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
school a whole host of
 
07:30:00.948 --> 07:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
items we were in the public school
 
07:30:00.958 --> 07:30:02.150 align:start position:0%
items we were in the public school
and

07:30:02.150 --> 07:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:30:03.990 --> 07:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
i was the first to be there at the end
 
07:30:05.910 --> 07:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the first day of school with my
 
07:30:07.990 --> 07:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
camera so i could get them coming off
 
07:30:09.990 --> 07:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
the bus with their big smiles
 
07:30:12.150 --> 07:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm grieving
 
07:30:14.708 --> 07:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
the loss of my oldest
 
07:30:14.718 --> 07:30:15.990 align:start position:0%
the loss of my oldest
not

07:30:15.990 --> 07:30:16.000 align:start position:0%

07:30:21.670 --> 07:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
at his school with his cub scout buddies
 
07:30:21.680 --> 07:30:22.388 align:start position:0%
at his school with his cub scout buddies
i

07:30:22.388 --> 07:30:22.398 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:30:22.398 --> 07:30:23.590 align:start position:0%
i
wanted

07:30:23.590 --> 07:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
07:30:25.830 --> 07:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
them to go to public school the way
 
07:30:28.230 --> 07:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
my husband and i did and have the same
 
07:30:30.948 --> 07:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
life experiences that we did i met my
 
07:30:32.788 --> 07:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
husband in high school
 
07:30:35.110 --> 07:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
i met him when i was 15 years old
 
07:30:37.670 --> 07:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
and i didn't marry him until i was 30
 
07:30:42.948 --> 07:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:44.948 --> 07:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
we did remote learning for fourth grade
 
07:30:46.868 --> 07:30:46.878 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic
 
07:30:49.830 --> 07:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
we are not interested in homeschooling
 
07:30:52.230 --> 07:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
this is not an option for us
 
07:30:54.628 --> 07:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
my son
 
07:30:57.510 --> 07:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
has been a priority in my life of course
 
07:30:59.990 --> 07:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
but then he was in public school in
 
07:31:02.708 --> 07:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
first grade i'm volunteering at the
 
07:31:02.718 --> 07:31:04.788 align:start position:0%
first grade i'm volunteering at the
school

07:31:04.788 --> 07:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:31:07.510 --> 07:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
each monday his teacher
 
07:31:09.670 --> 07:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
explained that she's gonna call a
 
07:31:11.190 --> 07:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
meeting because he's having trouble with
 
07:31:12.468 --> 07:31:12.478 align:start position:0%
his writing
 
07:31:14.388 --> 07:31:14.398 align:start position:0%
she can't read anything that he writes
 
07:31:15.750 --> 07:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
is what she said
 
07:31:17.830 --> 07:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
so i come to a room that looks pretty
 
07:31:20.628 --> 07:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
much like this big group of people
 
07:31:22.948 --> 07:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
talking about my son psychologist i
 
07:31:25.030 --> 07:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know who they were
 
07:31:25.040 --> 07:31:26.150 align:start position:0%
didn't know who they were
and

07:31:26.150 --> 07:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:31:28.070 --> 07:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
i trusted them
 
07:31:30.548 --> 07:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
my trust was misplaced
 
07:31:30.558 --> 07:31:31.590 align:start position:0%
my trust was misplaced
and

07:31:31.590 --> 07:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:31:31.600 --> 07:31:34.948 align:start position:0%
and
they

07:31:34.948 --> 07:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:36.388 --> 07:31:36.398 align:start position:0%
i thought they were doing what was best
 
07:31:38.788 --> 07:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
for my son and the more i learned the
 
07:31:40.628 --> 07:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
more i understood they were not
 
07:31:42.868 --> 07:31:42.878 align:start position:0%
following the child find mandate they
 
07:31:45.030 --> 07:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
were not offering vape
 
07:31:47.350 --> 07:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
which is the constitutional
 
07:31:47.360 --> 07:31:48.708 align:start position:0%
which is the constitutional
um

07:31:48.708 --> 07:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:31:50.628 --> 07:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
right to a fair
 
07:31:53.190 --> 07:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
free i'm sorry free and appropriate
 
07:31:56.230 --> 07:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
public education so let's talk about you
 
07:31:58.548 --> 07:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
are not allowed
 
07:32:01.510 --> 07:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
to ask the public school system for the
 
07:32:05.350 --> 07:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
best education this is the first rule of
 
07:32:07.510 --> 07:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
iep process
 
07:32:09.990 --> 07:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
the only thing you can ask for is a free
 
07:32:13.270 --> 07:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
and appropriate education
 
07:32:13.280 --> 07:32:14.150 align:start position:0%
and appropriate education
the

07:32:14.150 --> 07:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:32:16.310 --> 07:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
psychologist refused to test him when i
 
07:32:18.070 --> 07:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
brought her five thousand dollar
 
07:32:20.788 --> 07:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
neuropsych evaluation that we paid for
 
07:32:22.628 --> 07:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
we were told
 
07:32:24.070 --> 07:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
we do not accept his learning
 
07:32:24.080 --> 07:32:25.990 align:start position:0%
we do not accept his learning
disabilities

07:32:25.990 --> 07:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
07:32:28.628 --> 07:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
because he is able to pass
 
07:32:28.638 --> 07:32:29.590 align:start position:0%
because he is able to pass
which

07:32:29.590 --> 07:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
which
 
07:32:31.270 --> 07:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
according to the
 
07:32:34.788 --> 07:32:34.798 align:start position:0%
um ida ea law
 
07:32:36.868 --> 07:32:36.878 align:start position:0%
that doesn't matter if he can pass
 
07:32:39.590 --> 07:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's not a true statement i was also
 
07:32:40.948 --> 07:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
told by the
 
07:32:43.110 --> 07:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
director of special education only the
 
07:32:44.708 --> 07:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
parents can refer him to special
 
07:32:44.718 --> 07:32:45.910 align:start position:0%
parents can refer him to special
education

07:32:45.910 --> 07:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
07:32:48.150 --> 07:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
also not true his first grade teacher
 
07:32:50.150 --> 07:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
referred him to special education but
 
07:32:52.230 --> 07:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
now he was in fourth grade
 
07:32:54.548 --> 07:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
no iep a 504
 
07:32:59.830 --> 07:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:00.948 --> 07:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
asked me
 
07:33:02.548 --> 07:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
if he could speak to somebody because he
 
07:33:04.388 --> 07:33:04.398 align:start position:0%
was so sad
 
07:33:07.030 --> 07:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
so public school did not work for him it
 
07:33:09.350 --> 07:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
failed him
 
07:33:11.670 --> 07:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
it did not provide him and then
 
07:33:13.750 --> 07:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
if we were to get an iep then it would
 
07:33:16.868 --> 07:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
become my responsibility to ensure that
 
07:33:19.030 --> 07:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
that was being followed i would now need
 
07:33:21.670 --> 07:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
to become the school's checks and
 
07:33:23.590 --> 07:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
balances i would need to make sure that
 
07:33:25.830 --> 07:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
they were delivering it on that iep that
 
07:33:27.910 --> 07:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
i was keeping every email every
 
07:33:30.070 --> 07:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
paperwork every phone call
 
07:33:31.670 --> 07:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
enduring these meetings with a
 
07:33:33.510 --> 07:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
psychologist that told me he was not
 
07:33:36.070 --> 07:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
meeting my expectations
 
07:33:37.270 --> 07:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
so really
 
07:33:39.270 --> 07:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
i don't want to hold you up so
 
07:33:41.350 --> 07:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
i came here today to talk numbers
 
07:33:44.070 --> 07:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
actually and
 
07:33:46.150 --> 07:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
math is not my strong suit so
 
07:33:48.310 --> 07:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
please forgive me we're gonna just try
 
07:33:52.788 --> 07:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
to do a quick math um
 
07:33:54.310 --> 07:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
let's talk about who's taking the money
 
07:33:56.868 --> 07:33:56.878 align:start position:0%
away from the public school for a minute
 
07:34:00.868 --> 07:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
the efa is for low-income parents i
 
07:34:02.708 --> 07:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's clear
 
07:34:02.718 --> 07:34:03.750 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's clear
so

07:34:03.750 --> 07:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:34:06.468 --> 07:34:06.478 align:start position:0%
a family of four like us
 
07:34:08.708 --> 07:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
the limit is seventy eight thousand six
 
07:34:10.948 --> 07:34:10.958 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars okay
 
07:34:13.030 --> 07:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
so i am sending my son to a private
 
07:34:13.040 --> 07:34:14.150 align:start position:0%
so i am sending my son to a private
school

07:34:14.150 --> 07:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:34:15.830 --> 07:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
in which he
 
07:34:18.628 --> 07:34:18.638 align:start position:0%
is given orton gillingham along with all
 
07:34:20.388 --> 07:34:20.398 align:start position:0%
the other students in his class he is
 
07:34:22.388 --> 07:34:22.398 align:start position:0%
not singled out
 
07:34:24.628 --> 07:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
i had asked the school for this after
 
07:34:27.190 --> 07:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
the neuropsych evaluation they denied
 
07:34:27.200 --> 07:34:28.708 align:start position:0%
the neuropsych evaluation they denied
him

07:34:28.708 --> 07:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
him
 
07:34:30.708 --> 07:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
so he walks in the door he gets his
 
07:34:35.030 --> 07:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
needs met at the private school the cost
 
07:34:37.510 --> 07:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
of the private school for two children
 
07:34:39.990 --> 07:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
i need my classes
 
07:34:42.150 --> 07:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
is twenty thousand five hundred and
 
07:34:45.030 --> 07:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
sixteen dollars and eighty one cents
 
07:34:47.030 --> 07:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
what we receive for two children from
 
07:34:50.150 --> 07:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
the efa was nine thousand two hundred
 
07:34:50.160 --> 07:34:51.830 align:start position:0%
the efa was nine thousand two hundred
dollars

07:34:51.830 --> 07:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
07:34:53.030 --> 07:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
i have
 
07:34:55.030 --> 07:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
written out and
 
07:34:56.868 --> 07:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
i can provide to
 
07:34:58.628 --> 07:34:58.638 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
07:35:01.590 --> 07:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
a budget for a family of four
 
07:35:03.430 --> 07:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
based on tuition
 
07:35:05.190 --> 07:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
so after
 
07:35:08.948 --> 07:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
we paid for the registration materials
 
07:35:12.150 --> 07:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
and tuition the required t-shirt the
 
07:35:15.350 --> 07:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
computer and the outdoor gear required
 
07:35:19.030 --> 07:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
we then had a budget of 57 681 dollars
 
07:35:21.670 --> 07:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:23.030 --> 07:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
using not
 
07:35:24.948 --> 07:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
only my specific
 
07:35:27.990 --> 07:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
monthly budget or yearly budget i went
 
07:35:30.150 --> 07:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
and looked at averages so i have a
 
07:35:31.990 --> 07:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
website here where i found most of our
 
07:35:34.868 --> 07:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
information but just based on fifteen
 
07:35:36.388 --> 07:35:36.398 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a month
 
07:35:37.830 --> 07:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
that would equal eighteen thousand
 
07:35:39.670 --> 07:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
07:35:42.548 --> 07:35:42.558 align:start position:0%
um property taxes fifty five hundred we
 
07:35:44.388 --> 07:35:44.398 align:start position:0%
do pay property taxes we actually have a
 
07:35:46.070 --> 07:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
tenant unit
 
07:35:48.310 --> 07:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
so we're paying for that as well
 
07:35:50.150 --> 07:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
we pay health insurance private health
 
07:35:50.160 --> 07:35:51.270 align:start position:0%

[Music]
so

07:37:28.868 --> 07:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:37:31.430 --> 07:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
in hudson this school district that
 
07:37:33.110 --> 07:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
we're in it's roughly around sixteen
 
07:37:35.590 --> 07:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars to educate
 
07:37:37.590 --> 07:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
a student so i have two students around
 
07:37:40.310 --> 07:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
thirty two hundred dollars
 
07:37:41.990 --> 07:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
again we received that ninety two
 
07:37:43.270 --> 07:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
07:37:45.910 --> 07:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
to help with the cost of private schools
 
07:37:47.750 --> 07:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's roughly seven hundred and sixty
 
07:37:53.350 --> 07:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:57.270 --> 07:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
the public school would still have 23
 
07:37:59.670 --> 07:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
800 for these two children that no
 
07:38:01.350 --> 07:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
longer exist
 
07:38:02.708 --> 07:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
they don't need
 
07:38:08.708 --> 07:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:11.830 --> 07:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
if i looked at wyndham woods which is a
 
07:38:13.510 --> 07:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
private school that's actually a lot
 
07:38:15.270 --> 07:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
closer to where we live
 
07:38:17.910 --> 07:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
their per student tuition is forty one
 
07:38:20.310 --> 07:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year
 
07:38:22.150 --> 07:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
if we looked at a school like learning
 
07:38:25.110 --> 07:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
skills academy which would help with the
 
07:38:27.350 --> 07:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities that's fifty three
 
07:38:29.750 --> 07:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred and fourteen
 
07:38:32.388 --> 07:38:32.398 align:start position:0%
and sixty cents per student that's over
 
07:38:34.708 --> 07:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
a hundred and six thousand dollars to
 
07:38:37.910 --> 07:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:40.468 --> 07:38:40.478 align:start position:0%
now pitcher minimum wage
 
07:38:43.110 --> 07:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
household seven dollars and twenty five
 
07:38:45.590 --> 07:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
pence in new hampshire
 
07:38:47.750 --> 07:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
for one person that's fifteen thousand
 
07:38:50.230 --> 07:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
dollars to bring it home
 
07:38:52.310 --> 07:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
a couple that's thirty thousand one
 
07:38:54.150 --> 07:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
hundred sixty dollars
 
07:38:56.070 --> 07:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
the school again cost twenty thousand
 
07:38:59.030 --> 07:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
dollars for these two children
 
07:39:02.150 --> 07:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
compare that to your food bill the seven
 
07:39:04.388 --> 07:39:04.398 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
07:39:07.270 --> 07:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
in january in inflation
 
07:39:09.590 --> 07:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
compare that to the number of streaming
 
07:39:13.590 --> 07:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:15.990 --> 07:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
the median or the average cost of living
 
07:39:18.150 --> 07:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
in hillsborough county which i live in
 
07:39:19.708 --> 07:39:19.718 align:start position:0%
is 83
 
07:39:23.190 --> 07:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
667 dollars and 14 cents
 
07:39:23.200 --> 07:39:25.350 align:start position:0%
667 dollars and 14 cents
so

07:39:25.350 --> 07:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:39:27.110 --> 07:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
we can't ask for the best
 
07:39:30.388 --> 07:39:30.398 align:start position:0%
education i pay my property taxes and i
 
07:39:31.350 --> 07:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
07:39:34.310 --> 07:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
private school education i pay twice
 
07:39:36.948 --> 07:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
i am a taxpayer
 
07:39:39.830 --> 07:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
i would like to see low-income families
 
07:39:43.430 --> 07:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
receive funds for when the school system
 
07:39:43.440 --> 07:39:45.830 align:start position:0%
receive funds for when the school system
fails

07:39:45.830 --> 07:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:48.628 --> 07:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
i support teachers
 
07:39:51.350 --> 07:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think you can have it both ways
 
07:39:54.548 --> 07:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
you can support the efa
 
07:39:56.708 --> 07:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
you can oppose this bill
 
07:39:58.868 --> 07:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
and you can support teachers all at the
 
07:40:01.510 --> 07:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
same time it's not one or way or the
 
07:40:07.830 --> 07:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:07.840 --> 07:40:08.830 align:start position:0%
 
there

07:40:08.830 --> 07:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
07:40:08.840 --> 07:40:10.468 align:start position:0%
there
are

07:40:10.468 --> 07:40:10.478 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:40:10.478 --> 07:40:11.750 align:start position:0%
are
over

07:40:11.750 --> 07:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
over
 
07:40:13.750 --> 07:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
1600 students
 
07:40:13.760 --> 07:40:14.548 align:start position:0%
1600 students
that

07:40:14.548 --> 07:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:40:16.708 --> 07:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
ran to this program
 
07:40:22.468 --> 07:40:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:24.868 --> 07:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
we are low-income people trying to take
 
07:40:24.878 --> 07:40:25.830 align:start position:0%
we are low-income people trying to take
money

07:40:25.830 --> 07:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
07:40:27.910 --> 07:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
from our taxes
 
07:40:32.230 --> 07:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
to go to the school to help us survive
 
07:40:33.910 --> 07:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
07:40:33.920 --> 07:40:36.150 align:start position:0%
in order to
make

07:40:36.150 --> 07:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
make
 
07:40:39.430 --> 07:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
the 78 thousand six hundred dollars a
 
07:40:41.788 --> 07:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
family would need to make
 
07:40:44.388 --> 07:40:44.398 align:start position:0%
37.79 an hour
 
07:40:47.510 --> 07:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's not too bad right
 
07:40:50.868 --> 07:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
or that's two people at 18.90
 
07:40:54.948 --> 07:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
an hour but you take 20 000 off the top
 
07:40:56.708 --> 07:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
that doesn't leave much
 
07:41:05.430 --> 07:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:08.230 --> 07:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
we i don't necessarily want my funds to
 
07:41:11.030 --> 07:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
go pay for someone else's education
 
07:41:13.190 --> 07:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
my property taxes pay for that public
 
07:41:13.200 --> 07:41:14.388 align:start position:0%
my property taxes pay for that public
education

07:41:14.388 --> 07:41:14.398 align:start position:0%
education
 
07:41:18.468 --> 07:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
that i trusted and didn't work for us
 
07:41:21.750 --> 07:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
and told me that they don't accept
 
07:41:24.788 --> 07:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
his disabilities
 
07:41:24.798 --> 07:41:28.548 align:start position:0%
his disabilities
so

07:41:28.548 --> 07:41:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:30.150 --> 07:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
why not
 
07:41:32.388 --> 07:41:32.398 align:start position:0%
work the other way right can we just
 
07:41:35.350 --> 07:41:35.360 align:start position:0%

i think that's all the math i can handle
 
07:41:50.150 --> 07:41:50.160 align:start position:0%

thank you very much any questions any
questions

07:43:04.548 --> 07:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:43:07.030 --> 07:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
no no questions
 
07:43:09.270 --> 07:43:09.280 align:start position:0%

07:43:11.750 --> 07:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
here is there anybody out there that did
 
07:43:11.760 --> 07:43:17.270 align:start position:0%
here is there anybody out there that did
not

07:43:17.270 --> 07:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:18.948 --> 07:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
did you look well come on up if you have
 
07:43:23.590 --> 07:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:25.030 --> 07:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
then you might look under the table see
 
07:43:29.190 --> 07:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:34.468 --> 07:43:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:37.190 --> 07:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
hello my name is rick duba i'm head of
 
07:43:39.270 --> 07:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
school in my 18th year at laconia
 
07:43:40.548 --> 07:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
christian academy
 
07:43:42.548 --> 07:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
and prior to taking this position i
 
07:43:44.230 --> 07:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
taught for 14 years at plymouth regional
 
07:43:46.230 --> 07:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
high school and part of the reason i'm
 
07:43:47.910 --> 07:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
asking you to stay just this little
 
07:43:49.910 --> 07:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
extra bit is because i was a government
 
07:43:52.070 --> 07:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
and law teacher
 
07:43:54.230 --> 07:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
in plymouth and i dragged my kids to
 
07:43:55.430 --> 07:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
these hearings
 
07:43:57.670 --> 07:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
year after year after year made them
 
07:44:02.070 --> 07:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
testify and never actually did it myself
 
07:44:03.670 --> 07:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i've dragged my students down from
 
07:44:06.070 --> 07:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
lca and done the same thing and now i'll
 
07:44:07.590 --> 07:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
get to go home and say
 
07:44:10.788 --> 07:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
i did too so i will my remarks might be
 
07:44:11.990 --> 07:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
disjointed because i'm going to try to
 
07:44:12.000 --> 07:44:13.190 align:start position:0%
disjointed because i'm going to try to
really

07:44:13.190 --> 07:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
really
 
07:44:14.548 --> 07:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
get done here and i want to share one
 
07:44:16.628 --> 07:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
email with you so the father of four
 
07:44:16.638 --> 07:44:17.590 align:start position:0%
email with you so the father of four
children

07:44:17.590 --> 07:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:44:19.270 --> 07:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
three of whom spent their entire school
 
07:44:20.708 --> 07:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
career at lca
 
07:44:22.468 --> 07:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
my fourth child is currently a senior at
 
07:44:23.990 --> 07:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
newfound regional high school so i think
 
07:44:25.910 --> 07:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
my perspective might be unique my kids
 
07:44:27.270 --> 07:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
have been served
 
07:44:29.430 --> 07:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
very well by both schools
 
07:44:31.590 --> 07:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
the three that went to lca it was the
 
07:44:33.510 --> 07:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
right place for those kids
 
07:44:35.830 --> 07:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
the one that's graduating
 
07:44:37.510 --> 07:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
from newfound this year it's the right
 
07:44:40.708 --> 07:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
place for that one
 
07:44:42.628 --> 07:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate as a family and that my
 
07:44:44.628 --> 07:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
wife and i both work to afford private
 
07:44:44.638 --> 07:44:45.830 align:start position:0%
wife and i both work to afford private
education

07:44:45.830 --> 07:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
education
 
07:44:47.990 --> 07:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
and we could make the choice we had the
 
07:44:50.468 --> 07:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
resources to say you three go here
 
07:44:52.788 --> 07:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
and uh and you go here
 
07:44:55.110 --> 07:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
that's not true for a lot of families a
 
07:44:57.510 --> 07:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
lot of families don't have the resources
 
07:44:59.430 --> 07:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
to actually make an educational choice
 
07:45:01.270 --> 07:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
for the kids
 
07:45:03.430 --> 07:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i think the efas and the education
 
07:45:05.350 --> 07:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
tax credits that that's a game changer
 
07:45:07.190 --> 07:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
for these families that wish they could
 
07:45:08.868 --> 07:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps do something different for the
 
07:45:11.110 --> 07:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
kid that it makes a difference for and
 
07:45:13.510 --> 07:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
are unable to do so
 
07:45:15.750 --> 07:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i followed the debate
 
07:45:17.030 --> 07:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the media
 
07:45:18.628 --> 07:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
in the senate hearings a couple weeks
 
07:45:18.638 --> 07:45:19.590 align:start position:0%
in the senate hearings a couple weeks
ago

07:45:19.590 --> 07:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
ago
 
07:45:19.600 --> 07:45:21.270 align:start position:0%
ago
and

07:45:21.270 --> 07:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:45:22.468 --> 07:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
it seems
 
07:45:24.230 --> 07:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
as i hear people talk there seems to be
 
07:45:26.548 --> 07:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
some confusion or maybe misinformation
 
07:45:28.548 --> 07:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what it is but
 
07:45:30.230 --> 07:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear to me that money is
 
07:45:33.590 --> 07:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
being taken it's all what the money that
 
07:45:36.708 --> 07:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
is as the adequacy aid
 
07:45:39.190 --> 07:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
that goes with my kid has already been
 
07:45:41.190 --> 07:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
allocated for my kid
 
07:45:43.110 --> 07:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's just changing the place right now
 
07:45:44.868 --> 07:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
my son is at newfound is getting the
 
07:45:46.468 --> 07:45:46.478 align:start position:0%
state adequacy aid because he's at
 
07:45:46.478 --> 07:45:47.510 align:start position:0%
state adequacy aid because he's at
newfound

07:45:47.510 --> 07:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
newfound
 
07:45:49.510 --> 07:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
the three well the three that went to
 
07:45:52.708 --> 07:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
lca did not get any adequacy aid and
 
07:45:54.708 --> 07:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
neither did the district they were in
 
07:45:56.948 --> 07:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
so some of the questions about well were
 
07:45:59.510 --> 07:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
you in private school before the efas or
 
07:46:02.070 --> 07:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
not don't seem to matter because if they
 
07:46:03.910 --> 07:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
were not they matter
 
07:46:06.070 --> 07:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
if you ask them they matter for sure
 
07:46:06.080 --> 07:46:07.030 align:start position:0%
if you ask them they matter for sure
but

07:46:07.030 --> 07:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:46:08.868 --> 07:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
if a child withdrew from a public school
 
07:46:11.510 --> 07:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
prior to the efas the public school had
 
07:46:13.670 --> 07:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
already lost that adequacy aid and my
 
07:46:15.430 --> 07:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
understanding it's in the new hampshire
 
07:46:17.110 --> 07:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
charitable or the new hampshire
 
07:46:18.948 --> 07:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
07:46:21.030 --> 07:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's still that child's
 
07:46:23.190 --> 07:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid all the parents are asking
 
07:46:24.788 --> 07:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
is that it follow them to the school of
 
07:46:26.150 --> 07:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
their choice
 
07:46:28.708 --> 07:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
and that makes sense to me
 
07:46:31.350 --> 07:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
and and it's a portion of the aid that
 
07:46:33.190 --> 07:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
the public schools are getting
 
07:46:35.350 --> 07:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
right because the balance of that you've
 
07:46:37.270 --> 07:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
got someone was talking about you know
 
07:46:42.548 --> 07:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
18 000 kids and and 280 of them
 
07:46:45.030 --> 07:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
are brand new into private schools and
 
07:46:49.270 --> 07:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:50.868 --> 07:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
that those public schools were not
 
07:46:53.430 --> 07:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
receiving that adequacy aid last year
 
07:46:53.440 --> 07:46:54.788 align:start position:0%
receiving that adequacy aid last year
either

07:46:54.788 --> 07:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
either
 
07:46:56.388 --> 07:46:56.398 align:start position:0%
it was in the trust fund
 
07:46:58.150 --> 07:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
and now we're taking those funds and
 
07:47:00.548 --> 07:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
saying yes mom and dad if you think this
 
07:47:01.990 --> 07:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
is the best choice
 
07:47:03.910 --> 07:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
you can take that money with you and you
 
07:47:05.670 --> 07:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
now can make the same decision for your
 
07:47:07.830 --> 07:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
kids that my wife and i were able to
 
07:47:09.030 --> 07:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
make for ours because we had the
 
07:47:12.548 --> 07:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:15.270 --> 07:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the lakes region it cost between 15
 
07:47:17.030 --> 07:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
and 22 thousand dollars to educate a
 
07:47:20.150 --> 07:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
student in a public school
 
07:47:21.910 --> 07:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
and even without the average of four
 
07:47:24.230 --> 07:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in adequacy aid there's
 
07:47:25.910 --> 07:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
eleven to eighteen thousand dollars in
 
07:47:28.070 --> 07:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
resources that are left with that school
 
07:47:30.388 --> 07:47:30.398 align:start position:0%
without a child to educate
 
07:47:33.270 --> 07:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
um that seems to be in my opinion for
 
07:47:34.708 --> 07:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
families who are trying to choose what's
 
07:47:37.030 --> 07:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
best for their kid that seems to be an
 
07:47:39.030 --> 07:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate split
 
07:47:40.948 --> 07:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
uh i'm gonna con i continue to play
 
07:47:42.310 --> 07:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
07:47:45.190 --> 07:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
and the town of bristol and we'll do so
 
07:47:46.468 --> 07:47:46.478 align:start position:0%
for as long i'm not gonna leave the
 
07:47:47.990 --> 07:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
state new hampshire i love it up here so
 
07:47:49.670 --> 07:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
bristol will have my property taxes
 
07:47:49.680 --> 07:47:51.110 align:start position:0%
bristol will have my property taxes
forever

07:47:51.110 --> 07:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
forever
 
07:47:53.830 --> 07:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
um and and i won't have kids in that
 
07:47:55.590 --> 07:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
school and i have no problem with that i
 
07:47:57.910 --> 07:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair thing to ask of me
 
07:47:59.830 --> 07:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
i benefit from living here i benefit
 
07:48:01.830 --> 07:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
from the living in that town and i and i
 
07:48:03.510 --> 07:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
want to support that school
 
07:48:06.310 --> 07:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
but i i do think it's fair to ask to
 
07:48:08.788 --> 07:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
allow parents to have an option it's not
 
07:48:09.830 --> 07:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
07:48:11.990 --> 07:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's a small portion of what it costs to
 
07:48:13.670 --> 07:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
educate a child that they're able to
 
07:48:17.350 --> 07:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:19.270 --> 07:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
so as i consider the positive impact of
 
07:48:21.430 --> 07:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
the efas have had on students enrolled
 
07:48:23.270 --> 07:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
in my school
 
07:48:24.468 --> 07:48:24.478 align:start position:0%
and honestly
 
07:48:25.910 --> 07:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
i know some of you may not like to hear
 
07:48:28.708 --> 07:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
this but the relatively limited impact
 
07:48:30.468 --> 07:48:30.478 align:start position:0%
on the public schools i wonder if this
 
07:48:32.788 --> 07:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
debate hasn't become more about
 
07:48:34.468 --> 07:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
the freedom to choose and it is about
 
07:48:34.478 --> 07:48:35.830 align:start position:0%
the freedom to choose and it is about
money

07:48:35.830 --> 07:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
07:48:37.270 --> 07:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
when you look at i mean i just got an
 
07:48:39.110 --> 07:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
email from one of my teachers uh i won't
 
07:48:40.708 --> 07:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
tell you the district but they're about
 
07:48:42.310 --> 07:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
to they're putting a bond out to spend
 
07:48:45.270 --> 07:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
22 million dollars on a stem building
 
07:48:47.510 --> 07:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about 1.8 million
 
07:48:47.520 --> 07:48:48.948 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about 1.8 million
dollars

07:48:48.948 --> 07:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
07:48:50.070 --> 07:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
this year
 
07:48:52.070 --> 07:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
that didn't get stolen from anyone i saw
 
07:48:53.670 --> 07:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
the signs at the senate hearing stopped
 
07:48:56.310 --> 07:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
the steal the money's not being stolen
 
07:48:57.990 --> 07:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
the money is being allocated differently
 
07:48:59.350 --> 07:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
than it was being allocated before
 
07:49:01.510 --> 07:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
unless i misunderstand something and i i
 
07:49:04.548 --> 07:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
will stand corrected if i do
 
07:49:06.230 --> 07:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's really not on us against them
 
07:49:08.708 --> 07:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
private against public i've done both i
 
07:49:10.628 --> 07:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
love both
 
07:49:12.708 --> 07:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
it's really about choice and giving
 
07:49:14.708 --> 07:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
parents an opportunity that some parents
 
07:49:16.230 --> 07:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
don't have without the help that the
 
07:49:17.910 --> 07:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
efas provide
 
07:49:19.590 --> 07:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
so i want to encourage you to
 
07:49:21.030 --> 07:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
to support put your support behind
 
07:49:22.788 --> 07:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
parents and kids
 
07:49:24.868 --> 07:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
not relatively well-funded public
 
07:49:24.878 --> 07:49:26.628 align:start position:0%
not relatively well-funded public
institutions

07:49:26.628 --> 07:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
07:49:28.388 --> 07:49:28.398 align:start position:0%
um and if i could just share a real
 
07:49:30.310 --> 07:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
quick um hopefully it comes up you know
 
07:49:33.750 --> 07:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is do i have to identify the person
 
07:49:37.510 --> 07:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay or the town okay then i can read it
 
07:49:39.110 --> 07:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'll skip some stuff
 
07:49:40.788 --> 07:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
this is a parent who is in our school
 
07:49:42.868 --> 07:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
because of the efas
 
07:49:45.030 --> 07:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
and is moving out of state and we we do
 
07:49:46.788 --> 07:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
an exit survey with all our families and
 
07:49:49.590 --> 07:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
this is what she said
 
07:49:51.270 --> 07:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
see how i felt the survey we've been
 
07:49:53.030 --> 07:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly happy with the two years
 
07:49:55.190 --> 07:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
the boys have been at lca
 
07:49:57.270 --> 07:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
we employ two special edu certified
 
07:49:58.708 --> 07:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
state-certified special education
 
07:49:58.718 --> 07:49:59.670 align:start position:0%
state-certified special education
teachers

07:49:59.670 --> 07:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
07:50:01.030 --> 07:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
heather's one of them so heather has
 
07:50:03.430 --> 07:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
done so well with gabe and it's been
 
07:50:04.708 --> 07:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
nothing short of america to watch him
 
07:50:07.030 --> 07:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
grow academically socially as well as in
 
07:50:08.070 --> 07:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
his faith
 
07:50:09.750 --> 07:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
when he transitioned from his previous
 
07:50:11.990 --> 07:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
school his spirit was broken he hated
 
07:50:14.468 --> 07:50:14.478 align:start position:0%
school learning and emotionally was in a
 
07:50:15.910 --> 07:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
tough spot
 
07:50:17.750 --> 07:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
almost from the moment he started not
 
07:50:19.430 --> 07:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
once did he flinch when it came time to
 
07:50:20.628 --> 07:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
go to school
 
07:50:22.468 --> 07:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
he has found his quirky humor and love
 
07:50:23.830 --> 07:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
for learning again
 
07:50:25.510 --> 07:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
the kid can't keep a secret and has
 
07:50:27.110 --> 07:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
found trust and compassion in heather
 
07:50:28.948 --> 07:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
and tells her everything
 
07:50:31.350 --> 07:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
blake has turned into pre-teen overnight
 
07:50:33.270 --> 07:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
he's grown strong a strong faith
 
07:50:35.590 --> 07:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
foundation and devotion to god a kid who
 
07:50:37.350 --> 07:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
two years ago struggled to write a
 
07:50:38.948 --> 07:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
sentence and wouldn't be caught reading
 
07:50:41.030 --> 07:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
anything but graphic novels has been
 
07:50:43.670 --> 07:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
struck by lca's humanities class
 
07:50:45.510 --> 07:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
he has found engagement in the subjects
 
07:50:47.910 --> 07:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
to sustain his fleeting attention
 
07:50:49.590 --> 07:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
they both love their time at lca and i
 
07:50:51.270 --> 07:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
can only hope to find a schooling that
 
07:50:53.590 --> 07:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
will meet all my kids needs after our
 
07:50:53.600 --> 07:50:54.628 align:start position:0%
