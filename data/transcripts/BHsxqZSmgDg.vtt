00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
we'll also be sending out an index
 
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh that identifies each section of house
 
00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
by division assignment so in
 
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
respect division 3 is pretty lucky
 
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
because out of the 291 sections only 28
 
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
are likely to be assigned to division
 
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
three and those are the 28 that i'll go
 
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
through today
 
00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
so let me just pull up house bill 2 on
 
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
everybody see that yes
 
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the first section
 
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
that pertains to division three is
 
00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
section 20
 
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
which begins at the bottom of page nine
 
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
one of several boilerplate sections that
 
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
have appeared in trailer bills for the
 
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.310 align:start position:0%
have appeared in trailer bills for the
last

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
six to ten years this is a requirement
 
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner of hhs make
 
00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports on the status of
 
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
estimated medicaid payments in relation
 
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
to actual costs
 
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
this language continues unchanged from
 
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
the previous biennium
 
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
the next section that pertains to
 
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
division three unfortunately they're all
 
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
in a block here
 
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
is 21 on the next page which allows the
 
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
department to fill
 
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions over the biennium
 
00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
provided that the total expenditure for
 
00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
those positions doesn't exceed the
 
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
amount appropriated so
 
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
this requires the department to stay
 
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
within its total appropriation for
 
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.149 align:start position:0%
within its total appropriation for
personnel

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
costs but uh fill positions that are
 
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
unfunded as they arise
 
00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 align:start position:0%
this language is unique to hhs other
 
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
departments don't typically have this
 
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
although i think corrections may have
 
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
had it
 
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
at times in the past
 
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
22 repeals a couple of programs that
 
00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
repeals the congregate housing program
 
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
and the senior volunteer grant program
 
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
these are two programs that have been
 
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.990 align:start position:0%
these are two programs that have been
suspended

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
many times over the last decade although
 
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
they were
 
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
funded in the current 2021 budget the
 
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
senior volunteer grant program was
 
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
funded at 750 000 a year in general
 
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.270 align:start position:0%
funded at 750 000 a year in general
funds

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry the congregate services
 
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
was funded at 750 000 per year in
 
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
general funds and the senior volunteer
 
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
grant program was funded at 100 000 per
 
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
year in general funds
 
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
so this section unlike sections in past
 
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
years doesn't suspend those programs it
 
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
section 24 is the cap on county payments
 
00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
for long-term care services
 
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
this amount is changed each year in the
 
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
trailer bill
 
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
as you can see on line 22 here the
 
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year 21 cap
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
on county payments is 126.9 million
 
00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
that would go up to 148.9 million in
 
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 under the governor's proposed
 
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.470 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 under the governor's proposed
budget

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
moving down to section 25 i wouldn't
 
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily call this boilerplate but it
 
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
is something that's
 
00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
been in the trailer bill since 2012 i
 
00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.670 align:start position:0%
been in the trailer bill since 2012 i
believe

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
and this is the prospective repeal
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
regarding eligibility for
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
mental health services and this is one
 
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
of those items that if the committee has
 
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
any questions i would ask someone from
 
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 align:start position:0%
to come over and explain that but we can
 
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
delay those until until the end of this
 
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
moving on to section 26 this delays the
 
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.789 align:start position:0%
moving on to section 26 this delays the
repeal

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
of the department's exemptions from
 
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
certain transfer procedures
 
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
prevents agencies from transferring
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
between personnel class lines
 
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
but the department has an exemption to
 
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
that and they are allowed to transfer
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
between personnel class lines with
 
00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 align:start position:0%
prior approval of the fiscal committee
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
section 27 is another that if you have
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
any questions i would ask the department
 
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.830 align:start position:0%
any questions i would ask the department
to

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
attempt to explain this is
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
this pertains to the use of met revenues
 
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
that go into the grand advantage health
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
care trust fund or the expanded medicaid
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this revenue is
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
needed to go into the trust fund in
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
provide payments to critical access
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals but again that's something the
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
department can
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
sections 28 and 29 establish a new
 
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.990 align:start position:0%
sections 28 and 29 establish a new
emergency

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
services for children youth and families
 
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.030 align:start position:0%
services for children youth and families
fund

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
there is no funding in house bill 1 for
 
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.790 align:start position:0%
there is no funding in house bill 1 for
this

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
but the the fund is established here and
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's it would receive revenues from
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
gifts grants and donations so so i have
 
00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
a question for you and this is more
 
00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:15.189 align:start position:0%
a question for you and this is more
about

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
um formatting i i i
 
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
noticed that it had this
 
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
hp2 has had the standard
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
use of bolding of new language
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
and and that's really great because it
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
helps you track
 
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
changes section 28 and 29
 
00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 align:start position:0%
they say new sub paragraph a new section
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
but they don't have the bold and i'm
 
00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
if there's uh what the what the rules
 
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.270 align:start position:0%
if there's uh what the what the rules
are

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
so of consistency so that i i know how
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
to really look at this and read it i
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
believe that's because they do create a
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
new subparagraph and a new section if
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
they were amending an existing
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
section and changing the language that
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
new sub-paragraphs new sections because
 
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.790 align:start position:0%
new sub-paragraphs new sections because
it

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
identifies them at the outset those are
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
not involved
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
i think it looks like representative
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
i just wondered i'm sorry
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
on the emergency services fund for
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
children youth and families
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
do we have a does it correspond to a
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
line in
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
um house bill one
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it does it creates a new
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh dedicated account but there's no
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
funding in house bill one
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
and it limits the revenue sources to
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
gifts grants and donations so there's no
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
so if they receive
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
some gifts grants or some
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
funding and they i get they deposit it
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
in the state treasury
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
and then they want to spend it what's
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
well i believe since this creates a new
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund dedicated account it
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
would be the same as the authority for
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
dedicated account um what that is
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
specifically i'd have to look up
 
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 so so some of my questions are
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
process oriented i'm reading
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
this paragraph establishing the
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
emergency services for children youth
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
and families fund
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
starting on line eight
 
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
and so there's a legislative language
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
that would be inserted into one of our
 
00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.830 align:start position:0%
that would be inserted into one of our
statutes

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
yes are we effectively the only
 
00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:05.909 align:start position:0%
yes are we effectively the only
committee

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's reviewing this language to
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
determine its
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh its sufficiency uh or
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
or or are there any other policy
 
00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:16.629 align:start position:0%
or or are there any other policy
committees

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
involved in reviewing this particular
 
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.550 align:start position:0%
involved in reviewing this particular
language

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
i suspect this language will only come
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
to finance
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
there have been times in the past when
 
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.110 align:start position:0%
there have been times in the past when
uh

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
certain sections in house bill 2 have
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
been partitioned out and sent to other
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
agencies like ways and means for example
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
that may happen with a couple sections
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the trailer bill
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the committee could do that with
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
this section
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
or others if it desired but my suspicion
 
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.470 align:start position:0%
or others if it desired but my suspicion
is

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
finance will be the only committee in
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
this particular language
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
at the last game at the last chairman's
 
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.030 align:start position:0%
at the last game at the last chairman's
meeting

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
i sent off sections to all not all
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
policy committees there were a couple
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
that were involved but to most policy
 
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.150 align:start position:0%
that were involved but to most policy
committees

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
i sent off sections that i asked them to
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
review and get back to us if they wanted
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
any amendments
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
but whether or not they follow through i
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
don't know so for this particular
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
section uh representative weiler do you
 
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.750 align:start position:0%
section uh representative weiler do you
think

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
do you think you might have sent it sent
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
it to children and family law
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
and d8 and excuse me hhsea
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
take a look at if i can find my list
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
um children i sent now i sent page 43
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
number 74. i don't know if i did not
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
send this one
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
um health and human services i sent
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
several pages but i don't think i sent
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
all this
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
i had page 21
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
on page nine and that's this one they
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
sent nine through 24
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
i sent to hhs as well as um
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
148 144 i sent those to
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
h i sent references to those hhs
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
so but i did not send this one to
 
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.069 align:start position:0%
so but i did not send this one to
children

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
i think children i sent only page 43
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
my general summary of my concern here is
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're fulfilling
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
our responsibility
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
as a as a division to
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have an adequate hearing
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
on new
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
changes to statutes and that we're
 
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.470 align:start position:0%
changes to statutes and that we're
getting

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate public input
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
because that's what a that's what a
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
policy committee would do if they had
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
so um okay so and and as a
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
in my previous two terms hb the hb2
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
processes were
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
pretty obscure to me i i didn't see
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
what was going on and um and
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
okay that's my comment thank you mr
 
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.069 align:start position:0%
okay that's my comment thank you mr
ripple

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
ripple
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions here by
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
all right thank you you can continue
 
00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
all right thank you you can continue
okay

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
section 30 and 31 online
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
18 and 22 relate to parental
 
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.350 align:start position:0%
18 and 22 relate to parental
reimbursement

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
of services provided to children in need
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
of services
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
this allows the department to motion the
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
court to terminate any such orders for
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
parental reimbursement
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
and again i would ask the department uh
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
for more detail on those sections
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
and this has gone back and forth at one
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
point if you had a child needed services
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
and they were there for
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
a year in the sununu center then
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
the parents might be untapped for
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
another 20 years for paying for that
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars that it costs
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
for them to be in there a year
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
then we change the law subsequently to
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
say they only had to pay while the child
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
was in there and of course they looked
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
at their financial
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
need assess a financial assessment to
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
decide how much they would pay per month
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
and so many complained about the lengthy
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
period of time they were paying
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
back but we went to okay while the child
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
is there you've got to make payments
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
every month
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
but when the child leaves then you don't
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
so now we're back again until we can
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
continue to build unless
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
they come up with a decision to
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
terminate the requirement for that
 
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.670 align:start position:0%
terminate the requirement for that
particular

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
family yes
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
and moving on section 32
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
is boilerplate language that's been in
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
the last several trailer bills
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
it prevents the department from changing
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility standards or benefit levels
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
that would increase or decrease
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment without the prior
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
consultation of the house
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
hhs and elderly affairs committee and
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
section 33 starting at the bottom of
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
that page
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
states that any general funds
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
appropriated to hhhs
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
were supplanted by increased federal
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
funds uh would lapse
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
to the general fund so for example
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
say the department budgeted certain
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
medicaid services at 50 percent
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
and federal funds came in at 60
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
instead there was an enhanced federal
 
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.590 align:start position:0%
instead there was an enhanced federal
match

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
match
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
that difference uh under this provision
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
would last directly to the general fund
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
rather than staying within the
 
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.710 align:start position:0%
rather than staying within the
department

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
so i i have to i have to ask
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
who who has reviewed that policy to make
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
sure that that conforms with
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
cms or federal rules
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
i believe this language i believe this
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
language was included by the governor's
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
office i'm not sure that it's
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
necessarily an hhs
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
request so i i see
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh lisa english in the attendees list i
 
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:28.949 align:start position:0%
uh lisa english in the attendees list i
want

00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
would i don't want to put her on the
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
spot but if you think
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's office did it maybe we
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
could just ask real quick if
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's office has reviewed
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
this and
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
it conforms to
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
federal rules and regulations sure
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
let me just find her on the list here
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
matt million is also here from the
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
oh i didn't see him i just saw lisa
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry to put you on the spot if
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
you're not ready to talk to that
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh that i understand completely but if
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
you do know
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
and this was section 34 of house bill 2
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
um yes and not section 34 sorry let me
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
scroll up here it's 33
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
section 33 excess revenue from federal
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
match programs
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
yes i i would defer to the department
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
um on this particular
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
section um this did come from the
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
governor's office and i do think there
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be additional conversations
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
during the legislative phase
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
um and again i think the department
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
is probably the best to speak to exactly
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh what their
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
potential concerns might be and
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately whether this should move
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
so so fundamentally my my one question
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
is just
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh do do we do we know that this
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
active do we actively know that this
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
conforms with the federal rules and
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
regulations for their funding
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
um so so let's we can take that offline
 
00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:25.749 align:start position:0%
um so so let's we can take that offline
unless

00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
unless
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
no i defer to matt on this one yeah mr
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
chairman if we could circle back with
 
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
chairman if we could circle back with
you

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
and again probably loop the department
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
into these conversations as well to
 
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.629 align:start position:0%
into these conversations as well to
understand

00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
again the intent and also um just the
 
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.870 align:start position:0%
again the intent and also um just the
potential

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
uh pitfalls of of what this section
 
00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:48.829 align:start position:0%
uh pitfalls of of what this section
would

00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
effectuate i'd appreciate a chance to to
 
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:51.990 align:start position:0%
effectuate i'd appreciate a chance to to
bring

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
bring
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
more voices to the table in that
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
conversation perfect
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
so i think we can go to section 34. we
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
can i'm just going to move them back
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
over into the
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
all right section 34 on page 12 states
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
that no state funds awarded by hhs
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
shall be used to provide abortion
 
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.390 align:start position:0%
shall be used to provide abortion
services

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
section 35 on line 9 appropriates
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
that one's been in our loss for a while
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
right that's been in hb2 for a while
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh section 34 versions of this have been
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
in previous trailer bills
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
um it's also i believe been removed in
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
previous trailer bills
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
i can take a look at the history it
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't surprise me if there
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
is an existing chapter law out there
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
that already contains language
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
similar to this okay but but
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
again i'm just learning to read format
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
since it does
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's not labeled as a a new section or
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
new paragraph and there's no bold in
 
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.830 align:start position:0%
new paragraph and there's no bold in
there

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
that would uh suggest that this was uh
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
identical language in the previous hb2
 
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.470 align:start position:0%
identical language in the previous hb2
um

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
no not necessarily it's it's simply
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
suggested it's a new section
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's not amending anything that already
 
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.310 align:start position:0%
it's not amending anything that already
exists

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
so uh kind of in a b priority could you
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
could you follow up and
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
let us know the history of that
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph please
 
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.830 align:start position:0%
paragraph please
okay

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
unless uh representative walner or
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
anyone wants to
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
jump in and say what they know and then
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
we could just
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
i can take a look i know sorry i'm sorry
 
00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:52.230 align:start position:0%
i can take a look i know sorry i'm sorry
i

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
yes i was gonna say kevin let's take a
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
look at the history of this
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
section 35 appropriates 10 million 43
 
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.390 align:start position:0%
section 35 appropriates 10 million 43
000

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
to implement recommended recommendations
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
from the review conducted by alvarez and
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
marcel that was mentioned during the
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
department's presentation last week uh
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would note about this
 
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.190 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would note about this
section

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
and any other section in the trailer
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
build with an appropriation
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
is that these appropriations are in
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
addition to anything
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
in house bill one so this question came
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
up previously
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
as to where we would see these these
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
in the operating budget and you won't
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
see them because
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
okay so now i have a mechanical question
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
um as we're looking at
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
the the spreadsheets and the budget
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
briefing book to try to figure out
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
where we might uh reprogram monies
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know to and fro uh are
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to just have a post-it
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
note that we write to stick on the sheet
 
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.470 align:start position:0%
note that we write to stick on the sheet
somewhere

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh or how how do we get a comprehensive
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
integrated view
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the monies in hb2 that aren't
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
currently in hb1
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
what i can put to i can put together a
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
list it's quite short there are only a
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
handful of house bill 2 appropriations
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
to hhs okay
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
here's the next few sections basically
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
that list looked like a spreadsheet then
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
that would work with
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
my brain so okay sure okay
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
kevin it would be helpful
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
when you're putting together that list
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
would is this
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
all general funds or can we use some
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
sort of federal matching funds for this
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
consultation this would be a general
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
fund appropriation
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
when 100 percent under the existing
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
under the existing section right when it
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't state the source of funds is
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
general funds by default
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
um that's not necessarily to say that
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
you couldn't
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
use other sources for this purpose
 
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.950 align:start position:0%
use other sources for this purpose
though

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
i do could you just repeat what you said
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
kevin this money is being
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
appropriated outside of the budget is
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
that what you said
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
it's an appropriation that's contained
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
in the trailer bill yep so it's outside
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
of the operating budget it's not in
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
house bill one
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's just in the trailer bill instead
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
and this is something that has been done
 
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.470 align:start position:0%
and this is something that has been done
for

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
for many years okay
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
not capital budget nothing i'm saying
 
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.870 align:start position:0%
not capital budget nothing i'm saying
i'm

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
using the operating budget as synonymous
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
with house bill 1.
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
the capital budget doesn't show up on
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
hp1 does it
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
no this would be an operating approach
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
an operating budget appropriation it's
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
just not
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
one that's in-house bill one okay why do
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure this number might have been
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
settled on a bit later in the process
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
and so it was put into house bill 2. i
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
don't know the history behind it
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yep okay so said
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
a little differently just to make sure i
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
understand that kevin
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah um if
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
we looked at the total spreadsheet of
 
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.070 align:start position:0%
we looked at the total spreadsheet of
the

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
governor's operating budget that we've
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
been working with
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
and we were satisfied that the revenues
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
and expenses were in balance
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
then this 10 million dollars
 
00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.149 align:start position:0%
then this 10 million dollars
appropriated

00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
in hb2 would throw us out of balance by
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
10 million
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
and we'd have to go find revenue to
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
cover it
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
well i'm not sure
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
what the governor's office has done with
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
respect to its
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
um surplus statement so they may have
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
been accounting for this appropriation
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
on the surplus statement
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
and it looks like matt has his hand
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
raised in the audience so
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
i'll bring him back over okay let's
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
see if uh representative rogers she's
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
she's got a cartoon hand up that's
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
pretty that's
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
you're on mute though representative
 
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
you're on mute though representative
rogers

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
rogers
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
no i don't have anything up oh
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing what is that oh that's my
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
to a cartoon hand
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's funny sorry yeah sorry
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
um all right so matt you're not a
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
participant but you should be like yes
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you kevin and hello again mr
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
chairman uh what i would direct to the
 
00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:04.070 align:start position:0%
chairman uh what i would direct to the
committee

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
to and the lba will be compiling
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
this separately as well but if you go to
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
the governor's executive budget
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
summary on page 16
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
you see the surplus statement for the
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
of fy 22 and fy23
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
there is a line in there that is labeled
 
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.390 align:start position:0%
there is a line in there that is labeled
hb2

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
additional appropriations for 17.8
 
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.430 align:start position:0%
additional appropriations for 17.8
million

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
that is the sum of all appropriations
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
that are done
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
through hb2 as opposed to hb1
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
so yes we have accounted for those the
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
budget is still balanced with everything
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
that you see here in hb2
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
but as kevin said it's not tied to a
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative earth
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
has a question it may be for you
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
it is for him i'm just curious why why
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
is it done this way
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
so representative i'd say there's a
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
number of reasons
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
and all of them for different
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances some of them
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
come to timing uh of when just the
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
budget deadlines occur
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
and ongoing conversations so that
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
certainly is one instance
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
another instance might be if uh the
 
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.230 align:start position:0%
another instance might be if uh the
department

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
would need flexibility between
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
accounting units
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
and that is uncertain during the
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
governor's phase
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
of course there would still be a process
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
for any transfers and these ultimately
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
would need to be inserted
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
into a specific area of any agency
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i would say is most of
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
these are attributable to timing
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
or just uncertainties that exist in
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
january and february
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to may or june when the house
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
and senate go through and finalize the
 
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.750 align:start position:0%
and senate go through and finalize the
budget

00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what was that representative
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
keep going
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
so is there any reason that we wouldn't
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
incorporate them into at least
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
the parts that belong at hs
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
you could certainly incorporate them
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
into a specific accounting unit
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think you know there's a long-standing
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
practice that some appropriations are
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
done through house bill 2
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
we've certainly seen that over the past
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
two bienniums and
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
bienniums before that as well
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
so to some extent it is the committee's
 
00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:33.350 align:start position:0%
so to some extent it is the committee's
preference

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
preference
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with working with the lba
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
to identify that the best home for these
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
appropriations but i don't know that it
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
makes a functional difference
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i don't see any
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
other questions we
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
can we can continue miss rival okay
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
section 36 continues the suspension of
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid payments to hospitals
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
this is something that has been in the
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
trailer bill again since i believe the
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
section 37 is another general fund
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 1.5 million dollars to
 
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
provide grants to senior centers
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
or other organizations serving senior
 
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.269 align:start position:0%
or other organizations serving senior
citizens

00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
and section 38 is another appropriation
 
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:31.450 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars to
 
00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:32.830 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars to
[Music]

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.110 align:start position:0%
[Music]
support

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
continued admission discharge and
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
transfer event notifications within the
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
behavioral health system and i would let
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.630 align:start position:0%
 
appropriation

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
section 39 relates to the 60 bed looks
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
like representative earth has a question
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
oh representative irf go ahead so do
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
those last two fall in that same
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
category of things
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
being appropriate in hb2 and not yes yes
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
they are and they're included in that i
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
have the governor's surplus statement up
 
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.190 align:start position:0%
have the governor's surplus statement up
now

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
and i see where matt referenced the 17.8
 
00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:10.389 align:start position:0%
and i see where matt referenced the 17.8
million

00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 appropriations in fiscal
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
22. so these would all be included
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
within that number
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
11 and a half almost 12 million dollars
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
at least from hhs
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
section 39 relates to the 60-bed
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
forensic psychiatric hospital
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
that was established and funded in the
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
that has not been built yet but this
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
would extend
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
the 17 and a quarter million dollar
 
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.110 align:start position:0%
the 17 and a quarter million dollar
appropriation

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
that was made in the trailer bill so
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
that would be non-lapsing
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
as currently written it would lapse at
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
the end of this biennium and this would
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
allow that to roll forward
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
admittedly there is a provision here in
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
rome 3 on line 10 for a potential
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
cap expenditure and i'm not sure how
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
that would be addressed in capital
 
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.630 align:start position:0%
that would be addressed in capital
budget

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
looks like representative walner has a
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
question oh okay sorry i was reading
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative and then if you have
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
follow-ups just have a conversation
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
so i was one you sort of just hit on it
 
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.230 align:start position:0%
so i was one you sort of just hit on it
kevin

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
kevin
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
i was wondering how does this interact
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the capital budget because
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't we have a um
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
top dollar amount that we usually look
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
for for bonding purposes um
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
so if we're bonding over here in health
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it's outside of the capital budget
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this be in the capital budget
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
well i'll i'll leave that to uh
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
the the committees that determine that
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how it would work just
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
based on reading this section because
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
the capital appropriation here is
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
contingent on other
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
things happening it's contingent upon
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
not being available for example so
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
mechanically i'm not sure how it would
 
00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:19.830 align:start position:0%
mechanically i'm not sure how it would
work

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
and i do you have any um do you have any
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
idea what federal funds they might be
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
considering do we have any and when
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
those would be available
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i think the department
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
might have to answer that question at
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
some point
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so this was this is the
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation from
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
we had this in the previous budget it
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
was and i just wanted
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
it is and i just want to clarify what i
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
said i don't believe the appropriation
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
was 17 and a quarter million i think the
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation was somehow
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
less than that uh but whatever that
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
amount 16
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
i remember 16. okay um section
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
one on line three allows that to roll
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
forward for the next fiscal year
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
for the next biennium okay
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i think this is something
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
we should really talk to the department
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
about mechanics is how this is going to
 
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.669 align:start position:0%
about mechanics is how this is going to
work

00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
and move on to i want to stick a second
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
on the uh psychiatric hospital okay um
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
in in the military there were hard and
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
fast rules
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
where you just could not use
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
operating money for capital expenses and
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
vice versa
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
there were bright legal lines
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
do we have something like that in new
 
00:31:54.399 --> 00:31:56.710 align:start position:0%
do we have something like that in new
hampshire

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
or or is there is there there seems to
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
be some discretion
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
about when operating money can be
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
capital money
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
well you can certainly fund capital
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
projects through the operating budget
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's no restriction on that
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
may be norms regarding
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
what capital funds can be used on
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
operating projects for
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
all right so you just taught me
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
something new hampshire doesn't have a
 
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.509 align:start position:0%
something new hampshire doesn't have a
legal

00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
barrier between operating and capital
 
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.350 align:start position:0%
barrier between operating and capital
funds

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.549 align:start position:0%
funds
no

00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
let's see moving on to i think i lost my
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
place here sorry
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
page 13.
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh section 41 moves the
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
control drug prescription health and
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
safety program from the office of
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
and after that we'll move on down to
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
section 106.
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
now on this one section 41 i
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
i think hhs has revealed
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
re um reviewed bills in the past
 
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:35.669 align:start position:0%
re um reviewed bills in the past
about

00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
i think we lost you there
 
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.389 align:start position:0%
i think we lost you there
representatives

00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
um maybe i'm just not close enough to
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
the mic but
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
but hhs i think have reviewed
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
bills in the past on the controlled drug
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
prescription health and safety program
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
and so i'm just wondering um
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
if uh this is this should already be in
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
statute or if something
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
got the itl by hhs
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
well the program itself is already in
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
statute i believe the language is
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
transferred over in its entirety but
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
it's moved from dlc
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
to hhs
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
can you repeat where it's moved from uh
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
from the office of professional
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
so that division one would have a hand
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
in as well since that's where it
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
so um chairman
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
i don't know a lot of i mean i don't
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%

uh patricia tilly within hhs

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh my comment was
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
actually related to
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh one of the last things that
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative earth had said
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
specific to why appropriations might
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
live in hb2
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
as opposed to hp1 a number of these
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
items are also designed as
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
one-time appropriations which is another
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
reason why they might appear
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
here as opposed to the operating budget
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
given that they're not anticipated to
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
occur either in both years of the
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
biennium or
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
on an ongoing basis
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
did you have anything to add on the
 
00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.030 align:start position:0%
did you have anything to add on the
controlled

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
controlled
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
nothing other than that we've worked
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
with oplc and hhs
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
to incorporate this transition into hv2
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%

the engagement between the agency

we have been working collaboratively
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
with the office of professional
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
licensure for
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
a couple of years now relative to at a
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
minimum gaining access to the
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
information and more recently in the
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
last six months
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
on a conversation around where the
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
program should be appropriately housed
 
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.750 align:start position:0%
program should be appropriately housed
particularly

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
given its connection to public health
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
and the benefits to
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh the population that usurp we serve
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
around it being housed within our agency
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
current uh executive director attorney
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%

00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
with the um having the your alpha
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
mark just died i'm sorry uh and so
 
00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:09.750 align:start position:0%
mark just died i'm sorry uh and so
attorney

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
lindsay courtney the executive director
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
is is supportive of having
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
this house with the department not only
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
because of how it aligns with public
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
health needs
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh and and being better housed with our
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
agency but also as she's doing an
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
incredible job
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh relative to identifying structures
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
and organization
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
at the office of professional licensure
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
around their
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
board functions their licensing function
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
and their regulatory functions
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
that the prescription drug monitoring
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
program as it currently sits with them
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't align as well as it would within
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
our agency around public health
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
i would also uh just ask a deputy
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
director tilly if she could
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
offer some additional insight around
 
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.069 align:start position:0%
offer some additional insight around
that

00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
but i can say personally we've been
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
working directly
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh with oplc on this and they and they
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
so representative does that satisfy your
 
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.430 align:start position:0%
so representative does that satisfy your
question

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%

public health services thank you for
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
inviting me into this conversation so
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
john did a great job of just sort of
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
wrapping up that we have had a
 
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
several year process right now of
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
conversations with oplc
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
and also having policy conversations um
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
around the use of the pdmp
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
data and how we can best protect it
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
secure it
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
and use it to inform our public health
 
00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:57.829 align:start position:0%
and use it to inform our public health
policy

00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
and our behavioral health policy so um
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think there's a a couple of of
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
questions on the books one
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
um we have um we have thoroughly vetted
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
this through oplc
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
with the two departments are in
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
agreement that it seems to be a good fit
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
for it to sit here especially with some
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
of our other business lines of work
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
around handling other sensitive data and
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
registry type data um and then
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh forgive me i've i've lost the last
 
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.109 align:start position:0%
uh forgive me i've i've lost the last
half

00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
half
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
of a representative wellness question
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
no i think i think that answered it i do
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
have one further question though that i
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
would like to ask
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
so the budget that
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
um the oplc had
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
for this activity will be transferred
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
over to the department of health and
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
correct that's my understanding and much
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
of that is um they have some federal
 
00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:54.550 align:start position:0%
of that is um they have some federal
funds

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
um in addition to other funds to run the
 
00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.710 align:start position:0%
um in addition to other funds to run the
program

00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
and where would we see that in the where
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
will we see where will we see that
 
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.430 align:start position:0%
will we see where will we see that
transfer

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
of um income and
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures in the budget has it
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
is it in the budget that we have in
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
house bill one
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
and uh represent walder mr chair i would
 
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.030 align:start position:0%
and uh represent walder mr chair i would
defer

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
defer
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
to either the governor's office to to
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
matt and or to karen rounds they
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
probably would be better able to
 
00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:26.950 align:start position:0%
probably would be better able to
identify

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
where in the offering but operating
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
budget that that transfer would take
 
00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:30.710 align:start position:0%
budget that that transfer would take
place

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
obviously from a different division into
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
division three
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh budget so i i would defer that
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
question to
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
one of the financial folks if ms rounds
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
is on
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh it'd be great to bring her in because
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'd also just like a detailed question
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
about whether
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
we're starting up a new account line for
 
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.829 align:start position:0%
we're starting up a new account line for
this

00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
that we'll see in the future in hb one
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
good morning chair good morning did you
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
hear my question while you were being
 
00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.030 align:start position:0%
hear my question while you were being
transferred

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
i did uh yes the the appropriations
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
are within the public health department
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
our division rather
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
um and they have been transferred as
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
they would have been budgeted at oplc so
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
there are no increases
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
um it is just transferring those
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
accounting units over
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
to the division of public health so is
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
this in the spreadsheet now
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
or or or will is that just something we
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
have to factor in
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
no it's already in hb1 uh reflected
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
um it's already there okay
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
fantastic isn't it is it
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
is it merged with any other funds or is
 
00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:47.670 align:start position:0%
is it merged with any other funds or is
its

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
its
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
own distinct line they're their own uh
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and it's probably more
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
than one accounting unit
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
um and those will be covered when we
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
cover the division of public health i
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
believe that's the last division we
 
00:42:59.359 --> 00:42:59.910 align:start position:0%
believe that's the last division we
cover

00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
a week and a half from now or so very
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
good representative
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
weiler has had his hand up a while yes
 
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.349 align:start position:0%
weiler has had his hand up a while yes
sir

00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you i just want to point
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
out that this goes on for eight more
 
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.589 align:start position:0%
out that this goes on for eight more
pages

00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
pages
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
in this item if anybody's interested in
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
the detail and
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
we should keep track of things where
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
money is transferred into hhs
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
when we compare the spend from previous
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
biennium that we ought to
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
be aware of the fact that this is new
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
money that came in
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
from with other parts of the budget and
 
00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:34.790 align:start position:0%
from with other parts of the budget and
not

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
if we try to make a uh a total
 
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.150 align:start position:0%
if we try to make a uh a total
comparison

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not seeing any other
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
questions uh miss tilly
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh did you have anything you wanted to
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
say that we've not asked you
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative edwards um
 
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.030 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative edwards um
as

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh karen rounds described when we do our
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
dphs review
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
um we'll surely have an opportunity to
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
let's see so we're moving on down
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
moving on now to section 106 which i
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
just need to find here
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay section 106 here
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
relates to the veterans home and it
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
basically gives the veterans home the
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
same language
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
that hhs has elsewhere in the bill
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
allowing them to fill their unfunded
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
positions during the biennium
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
provided that their total expenditures
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
for personnel services
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
don't go up or don't exceed the amount
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
appropriated and this
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
i need to go back and check they may
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
have this language currently and they
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
may have had it previously
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
something that the veterans home has had
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
likewise section 107
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
provides the veterans home with special
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
transfer authority
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
and this is something that exists in the
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
let's summarize that if you could
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
summarize the special transfer authority
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
how how would you say it in a few words
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh well it gives the commandant broad
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
authority as you can see here on lines
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
26 and 27
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're author they're authorized to
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
create accounting units expenditure
 
00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:45.990 align:start position:0%
create accounting units expenditure
classes

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
classes
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
as necessary to address present or
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
projected budget deficits so that's
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
that's quite that's unusually broad but
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
it is authority that they've had
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank years but they still need to go
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
to gnc
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
for approval of those transfers what is
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
the gnc
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
section 108 also pertains to the
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
veterans home
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
this i believe is new
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
actually they may have had this before
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
as well uh relates to per diem payments
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
and states that actually i need to take
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
a closer look at this one to see if this
 
00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.150 align:start position:0%
a closer look at this one to see if this
is

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
to see if this is something they've had
 
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.030 align:start position:0%
to see if this is something they've had
previously

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm having a hard time reading it
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
just because i
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
i want to associate the term per diem
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
with the payment
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
to um like a
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
a day-to-day nurse a visiting nurse
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of it doesn't read that way to
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
i may have to take a closer look at
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
these veterans home sections to see what
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
they do and also see if they've had
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
these sections previously
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay when when are we scheduled to see
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
the veterans home they're
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
coming right they are last or second to
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
last i think you may be seeing them on
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
the same day as public health in about a
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
week and a half
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
and they can talk about those sections
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
as well as sections 109
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
and 110 which also exempt them from
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
statutory provisions related to
 
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.069 align:start position:0%
statutory provisions related to
transfers

00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that section 110 actually is the last
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
section under the purview of division
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
three so
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's all i have for now unless the
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
committee has any questions
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm looking to see if
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
anyone's got their hand up in the
 
00:47:59.119 --> 00:48:00.390 align:start position:0%
anyone's got their hand up in the
committee

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm not i'm not seeing any
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
um and so let's let's give it about 30
 
00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.230 align:start position:0%
um and so let's let's give it about 30
seconds

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
to see if anyone in the attendees list
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
wants to raise their hand uh if anyone
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
in the attendee list wants to raise your
 
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:16.630 align:start position:0%
in the attendee list wants to raise your
hand

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead i would just ask you if you
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
have comments to speak uh very directly
 
00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
have comments to speak uh very directly
to

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
a particular section that we're
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
reviewing and that you keep your
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
comments to the policy
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any attendees hands are
 
00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.589 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any attendees hands are
you

00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not so i think
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
we've successfully done a walkthrough of
 
00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:46.470 align:start position:0%
we've successfully done a walkthrough of
hb2

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a few outstanding issues
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
were you able to talk and record the
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
open items mr ripple i mean that's a lot
 
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
to do both i think joan has been keeping
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
track of the committee's questions so we
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
should be all set
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay so before we come off of this let's
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
do something we've not done before
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh mr feldstein would you would you
 
00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.750 align:start position:0%
uh mr feldstein would you would you
summarize

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
summarize
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
what you have down as open items
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah of course representative i
 
00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:24.309 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah of course representative i
have

00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%

um let me just pull this up here i have
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
a request from representative edwards
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
for the governor's office
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
and the department to provide
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%

00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
regarding the need for the provision
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
i have a separate request from
 
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.150 align:start position:0%
i have a separate request from
representative

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
walner regarding for the department
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
regarding what federal funds will be
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
used for their forensic psychiatric
 
00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:46.630 align:start position:0%
used for their forensic psychiatric
hospital

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
and provide additional information on
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
mechanics with the budgeting
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
and then um a few requests for us of the
 
00:49:54.079 --> 00:49:55.670 align:start position:0%
and then um a few requests for us of the
lba

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
lba
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
regarding section 34 of hbb2
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
and looking at the history of that from
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative wallner
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
and then for representative edwards to
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
create a spreadsheet with funded
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
provisions from hp2 not included in hp1
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
anyone from the committee think that
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
something got missed that that sounded
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
i think representative nordgren that was
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
a thumbs up you're okay or you have a
 
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.790 align:start position:0%
a thumbs up you're okay or you have a
comment

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think she's okay all right well so
 
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:32.950 align:start position:0%
i think she's okay all right well so
that

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
concludes this portion of the of today's
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
work session um we're gonna meet at one
 
00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:41.030 align:start position:0%
work session um we're gonna meet at one
o'clock

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
but i i would like to spend the next 30
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
minutes or so with the committee
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
talking about this work session
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
and well using this work session to talk
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
about future work
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
sessions this is probably not going to
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
be of much interest to the public
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
because it's really just i think
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
the division iii needs to talk about
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
some ways of working because
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
i i don't really have a firm grasp
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
on what a finance work session looks
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
like i have some assumptions
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
about what it could look like but but i
 
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
think it's important for us to get in
 
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.190 align:start position:0%
think it's important for us to get in
sync

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
sync
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
on on how we're going to use these work
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
sessions in the future
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
so um so representative
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
wallner looked like you were ready to
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
talk did you or was that just
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
no okay so um
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
you can you can drop miss tilly if you
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
want uh
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh mr ripple and uh and and
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
ms rounds is always uh she's sort of our
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
extended team
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
member here um but so what i think
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
of when i think of the term work session
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
i put it in the context of my experience
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
in the other
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
policy committees where we would have
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
um executive sessions on bills so we
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
would you know have the type of meeting
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
or hearing
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
where we get public input and all of the
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh reps would ask questions of the
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
people coming in to testify
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
but there really wasn't crosstalk or
 
00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:17.430 align:start position:0%
but there really wasn't crosstalk or
debate

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
debate
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
i i and then they would take a look at
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
in an executive session and determine
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know uh the pros and cons and and
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
then vote
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
you know otp or itl or some other motion
 
00:52:31.839 --> 00:52:32.549 align:start position:0%
you know otp or itl or some other motion
um

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of it now i don't see us
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of voting but i do see us
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
needing to have uh interactive
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
conversations with each other
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
that are open to the public so they you
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
know the public is aware of what we're
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
thinking and
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
and why um and and so
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
so so my overall concept and i'm asking
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
you to clarify this so that i know what
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh is to is does that sound like a
 
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.670 align:start position:0%
uh is to is does that sound like a
standard

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
work session in division three and
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
um i i didn't see which hand went up
 
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.069 align:start position:0%
um i i didn't see which hand went up
first

00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair what we've got to
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
do is find out
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
how much of the revenue is
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
is going to go to the hhs and that's
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
complicated by the fact that uh
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
we just saw a transfer from oplc
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
into hhs which
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be counted as as new revenue i
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
then one of the things we've done in the
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
past especially in the senate
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
where they were expecting a grant
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
and it would come through fiscal they
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
took it out of the budget completely
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
to make it look like it was less and we
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
are also aware
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
in many of these programs that
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
money is coming from federal federal
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
grants but
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly how much but many
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
many of these grants are like three-year
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
grants and if this is the first year of
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
the grant coming into this budget then
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
we can assume that the other ensuing
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
years will be about the same amount
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh that isn't always done sometimes they
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't put a figure in because they say
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
well we're not
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
sure but it's within a small percentage
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
depending on what other states are doing
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
with those grants so
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's not much variation from
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
what they're getting for the first year
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
of the grant
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
so we we need to take account of all
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
those things then we need to make some
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
tough decisions of
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
where we save and go back through and
 
00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.270 align:start position:0%
where we save and go back through and
see

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh each person will want to identify
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
targets some of us
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
are going to get a lot of feedback from
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
counties on reducing
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
the county caps it's a huge increase for
 
00:54:56.799 --> 00:54:57.829 align:start position:0%
the county caps it's a huge increase for
counties

00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
to struggle with it from three percent
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
the typical three percent to 18 percent
 
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:02.710 align:start position:0%
the typical three percent to 18 percent
increase

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
so we want to look at those things we
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
want to make some decisions we want to
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
have to have kevin keep as well as
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
prized as
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
how much how much we can spend versus
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
how much they want to spend those are
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
going to be tough decisions so
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's going to take most of our
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
walter did you did you want to help me
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
understand the concept
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
of how we use worksafe well
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
i i would say that you know i've been
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
here i've been on finance a long time so
 
00:55:38.079 --> 00:55:38.710 align:start position:0%
here i've been on finance a long time so
i've

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
i've
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
work sessions have been done in a
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
variety of ways
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that one thing that you
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
need we need to do
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
is and people have done it in different
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
ways but
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
is to get focused on
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
the areas that um we either have more
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
or people feel that there needs to be
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
appropriations need to be different than
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
what what the governor has proposed
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
but we need to start sort of whittling
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
it down
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
we've actually done it in ways where
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
we've gone through
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
kevin probably remembers doing this a
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
few times
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
go through every page and if the page
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
looks good
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
if we you know as a division we
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
think the page looks good or the
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
program looks good with the funding it's
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
got we'd put a check mark by it
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
we could always go back and revisit but
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
um it would get us so that we could
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
focus in
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
on the areas that we had the most
 
00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.150 align:start position:0%
on the areas that we had the most
questions

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
or we needed to take a look at the
 
00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.789 align:start position:0%
or we needed to take a look at the
appropriations

00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
or the staffing or whatever it was in
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
that in that area
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
but unless we do that unless we we need
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
to find a way i think
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
to get focused on certain areas of the
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
budget i mean some lines are
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
some areas are really big and we haven't
 
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
gotten even to the big ones yet
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
when we get to the medicaid lines we're
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
really into very large
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
so let me let me um drill down in your
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
comment there i think it was
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
very useful and i have a segue to to say
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
how i think we might do that focused
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
effort mr
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
ripple could you uh pull up and share
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
the excel sheet that you sent this
 
00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
the excel sheet that you sent this
morning

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
that shows fy 18 and 19 and
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to ask you to justify it
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to have people look at it
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
make sure they got it and
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'll talk to what i'm doing with it sure
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative norgren you took your
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
hand down i assume this because
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative said what you wanted to
 
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.630 align:start position:0%
representative said what you wanted to
say

00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay so this is as good a place to end
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
up as any
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
but but um okay so
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
so what i have been asking mr ripple to
 
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.150 align:start position:0%
so what i have been asking mr ripple to
do

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
and what he's delivered to us is
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
is this a is a very similar view
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the governor's budget um as we have
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
in our budget book this is like pages
 
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:31.190 align:start position:0%
in our budget book this is like pages
three

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
four and five um in soft copy
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
and extended so that we see what actual
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
fy 18 and 19 were as well
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
and i i've been asking for this because
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
i i being new to the committee i
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
particularly need to see a longer
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
historical tale
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
so that i can tell what how we're
 
00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.710 align:start position:0%
so that i can tell what how we're
trending

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
trending
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
and so um so what i'm i'm going to be
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
doing with this
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
could you scroll down to the bottom of
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
child development program the dehs just
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's just it's almost right there right
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
there okay
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
so so what i've been doing uh
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
as of this morning is going through
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
and looking at the year-to-year
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
percentage growth
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
in each of these line items um
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and particularly where
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
the the the amount of money
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
is considerable taking a special look at
 
00:59:34.319 --> 00:59:34.710 align:start position:0%
is considerable taking a special look at
that

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
like for example if i had done dehs
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the client services field operations
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
it would it would show that we went from
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
11 million and 18
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
to projected 13 5 and 23
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
and and there'd be a year to year growth
 
00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.309 align:start position:0%
and and there'd be a year to year growth
there

00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
now that would just be data
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
that would indicate whether or not this
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
is an area we want to drill down
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm a very top-down
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
structured thinker you know it's how you
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
design software it's how you do a lot of
 
01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.510 align:start position:0%
design software it's how you do a lot of
things

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
but that's how i think and so i
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
i am proposing that we use this sheet
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
so that when we get together in work
 
01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.390 align:start position:0%
so that when we get together in work
sessions

01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
we can highlight at the higher level
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
the the areas of concern that we have
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and this can trigger us to go deeper
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
into the budget books
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
for information and to ask questions so
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's basically how how i see us
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
doing kind of a top-down structured uh
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
review and uh assessment of the
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
well i think the history is is
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
for this sheet is good to have the
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
history i do think though you need
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
to be going back at some point
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
and looking at the at the pages and at
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
the programs
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
because even i mean even these
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
lines are comprised of a lot of
 
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:12.950 align:start position:0%
lines are comprised of a lot of
different

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of different things so if you want
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
to be specific about
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
a line that you think is over budgeted
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
you can't just you can't just reduce the
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
bottom line you can't just
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the total you need you may need
 
01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.670 align:start position:0%
reduce the total you need you may need
to

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
be specific about how you want that
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
reduction to happen
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
oh oh sure i'm just going to do a flat
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
back of the budget reduction no no no no
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
no no no
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just trying to describe a
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
top-down way to
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
maintain focus i i would not at this
 
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.510 align:start position:0%
maintain focus i i would not at this
level

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
start recommending cuts like for example
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
what i might do
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
is on line uh excel line 27
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh briefing book line 47
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
where it says aptd grants
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
kind of just i would would look at the
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
trend and look at the numbers and i'd go
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
okay that one's probably okay that's not
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
one that i really need to drill down
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
into immediately i that would be
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
something i'd look at later but but then
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh as contrasted with the client
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
services field operations line
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
that that that looks like it's going up
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
five to eight percent per year
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
which is higher than the rate of
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
inflation i'd probably and it's a
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money it's 13.5
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
million by the time it's the budget's
 
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.910 align:start position:0%
million by the time it's the budget's
done

01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
that would probably jump out at me as
 
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:42.950 align:start position:0%
that would probably jump out at me as
one

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
area that i'd want to drill down deeper
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
to understand it
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
even at this level i wouldn't say let's
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
cut that because you've got to dig
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
into it to figure out what's in there
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
why it's
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
trending that way but this is sort of to
 
01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.230 align:start position:0%
trending that way but this is sort of to
me

01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
almost like a radar system to where you
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
can see the the major pings
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
in the budget for where we need to focus
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
um no i just think that we're going to
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
need to go back
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
and to the pages and look at more
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
specific information
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
um i mean for instance if you take
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
oh i'm trying to look at an item that
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
that does
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
increase okay so the client services i
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
mean there's a lot of things we need to
 
01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.470 align:start position:0%
mean there's a lot of things we need to
find

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
find
 
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
out about that before i mean we might
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
put it on our radar but we
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things for all we know
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
they became responsible for a lot of
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
other things in the department that they
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
hadn't done before um
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
so we really have to drill down into
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
i i think we're in violent agreement but
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
because you've been doing this for
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
24 years and i've been doing it for 24
 
01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.910 align:start position:0%
24 years and i've been doing it for 24
days

01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like you have a phd in this
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the freshman the freshman
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
introductory course
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
i i'm explaining how i'm viewing our
 
01:04:09.039 --> 01:04:09.990 align:start position:0%
i i'm explaining how i'm viewing our
process

01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
and hoping that it it fits
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
with with where you're at and and so
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh represent representative uh nordgren
 
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
did you
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up your you keep
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
coming in and out
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
well mary jane is covering a lot um
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i think what we need to do is
 
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.190 align:start position:0%
yeah i think what we need to do is
finish

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
finish
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
all the work with every department
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
and then go back to these and then
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
pick out where we want to go to the
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
budget book
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
so i think that's really the process
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
for the next i think we need to set a
 
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.230 align:start position:0%
for the next i think we need to set a
timeline

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
with our calendar so we know exactly
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
where we are when we get to
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
the point of finally making the cuts
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
and and going to those pages
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the budget book okay that's a good
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
comment let me let me say a couple of
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
things about that
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
one let me verify that you've received
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
the calendar of for march from mr ripple
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
showing sort of each day of the
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
month of march the things that we're
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to do that day
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
as a committee because that's a nice
 
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.109 align:start position:0%
as a committee because that's a nice
overview

01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
overview
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
so is that the one that we got weeks ago
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
well and then he updated it when we
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
moved uh things around this week
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
so so the most recent update was like
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
towards the end of last week i think
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
this one could you send that out again
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we all have that or
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't remember getting it yeah no
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm i
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
i like it so much i cut the relevant
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
portion out and i've taped it to my desk
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
so it's it's sort of like my day planner
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
um and i
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
and and i i absolutely agree with you as
 
01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:08.870 align:start position:0%
and and i i absolutely agree with you as
well

01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
that that uh we have to be getting into
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
the detail in the budget book before we
 
01:06:13.359 --> 01:06:13.829 align:start position:0%
the detail in the budget book before we
can

01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
intelligently think we should in add
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
money or cut money
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
you recommended that we continue as we
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
have been that
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
because that was the other question i
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask now that we're sort of
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
halfway through
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
do we like
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
the way we're going through the budget
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
with the the department presentations
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
followed by uh the excel sheet in the
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
in in between the budget book items
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
is that is that do we still like that
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
consistent approach and should we
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
continue that with the remaining
 
01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:56.470 align:start position:0%
continue that with the remaining
departments

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative yeah just a comment um i
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
i wish we were using the briefing book
 
01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:03.670 align:start position:0%
i wish we were using the briefing book
more

01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
um i think when the department sends us
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
a huge package to look for the neck
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
to look at the next day it'd be much
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
better if we could send those out
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
sooner and we could use them along with
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
the briefing book to get ready
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
for that uh presentation but
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the things mary jane and i
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
as in the future it'd be good if the
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
briefing book we got
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
in the first place contained all those
 
01:07:35.079 --> 01:07:36.870 align:start position:0%
in the first place contained all those
presentations

01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
so we could have everything in one place
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
and not get you know one the night
 
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.270 align:start position:0%
and not get you know one the night
before

01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
i i think that's good feedback and and i
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
i suspect
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh the department would have a reason
 
01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.630 align:start position:0%
uh the department would have a reason
for

01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
telling us why we're getting things in
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
the sequence we're getting them in the
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
timing but
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to assume any of that
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
mr ripple do you want to speak to that
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
or ms rounds
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
i know i know that you're sending us
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
as far as why the calendar was set up
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
the way it was it was simply a matter of
 
01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.030 align:start position:0%
the way it was it was simply a matter of
uh

01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
the schedules that worked for people and
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
and how much time we thought needed to
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
be allocated to each area
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
there wasn't necessarily any rationale
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
for the sequence other than that
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
okay but representative nordgren is
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting that
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
she would like to have the presentations
 
01:08:37.839 --> 01:08:38.630 align:start position:0%
she would like to have the presentations
earlier

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
and during the briefing time that we
 
01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:42.470 align:start position:0%
and during the briefing time that we
have

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
oh i see i think she's asking
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
that more emphasis be put on the
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
briefing book pages
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
because uh that that's material to the
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
way she looks at
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh the budget process okay i
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's something that uh that
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
with with regards to the presentations
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
if you don't
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
mind chair i can speak to that um
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's truly a time constraint issue there
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of competing demands on
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
the directors
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
and and so preparing those several weeks
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
ahead of time it is
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
very difficult from a time constraint
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
issue so that's
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
i i assume your priority is that budget
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
book that that
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
and and so you put all your effort into
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
that and then
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
after the fact people work on their
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
presentations using historical documents
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
and modifying it a bit
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes we the priority definitely is
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
the budget briefing book that takes
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
several months to put together we
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
started that back in
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
november december so that is the
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
priority to have those done
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
and of course as you all know the
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
directors have
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
other competing priorities beyond the
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
budget too
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
they actually have work to do and they
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
do yeah
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
so and double work with covet
 
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.270 align:start position:0%
so and double work with covet
unfortunately

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay so so so i think the
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
the short answer representing nordgern
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
is is
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to try with the
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
departments to have us spend more time
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the budget books when the
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
departments brief us
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll see how it goes because put a
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
lot of time in these presentations and
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
and i would say that most of the
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
presentations do incorporate everything
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
that we say in the briefing book
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
the briefing book is really meant to be
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
a resource
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
that as you start to review and try to
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
make decisions on
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
on reductions or increases that you're
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
able to go to that
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
accounting unit in the briefing book and
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
be reminded exactly what it is
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
um just in case some there's not
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
somebody from the department available
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
or you're working on it
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
you know off time um that
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
that you have those resources available
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
but um we can certainly
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know talk about them in the
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
presentations to the extent that people
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um so so mr ripple
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'm looking at the
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
the march calendar you put together for
 
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.870 align:start position:0%
the march calendar you put together for
us

01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
and uh what i'm not maybe it's on here
 
01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.189 align:start position:0%
and uh what i'm not maybe it's on here
but

01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
but could you tell me our drop dead date
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
where division three should expect to
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
have its work
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
kind of done to for the overall finance
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
absorb our work yes
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
the divisions let me just pull up this
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
the divisions need to have their
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations in by i believe the 26th
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i currently have the 24th as the
 
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.110 align:start position:0%
so i currently have the 24th as the
final

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
day of work sessions but you could go
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm just looking at the words
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the calendar you sent the words say
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
budget slash
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
bill work sessions yep but this one
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
is an important one because this is this
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
is what you
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
think it should be our planning drop
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
dead date
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
even though the 26th is our real drop
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
it would be ideal if the committee could
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
get all its work done by the 24th but
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
always happen so yeah i so yes the short
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
answer is i had planned on the 24th but
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
you do have an extra couple days
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna write a note
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
on on my desktop that says we're going
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
plan drop dead on the 24th
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
so those are those are important dates
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
all to have in mind and uh
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll try to work out some thoughts
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
on where we can be with the work
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
sessions that are already
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated in here so uh representative
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
yes uh i want to remind you that he puts
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
the 24th
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
all our lba people are putting in
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
18-hour days and more
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
no weekends during this budget time
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
period so
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know he's got to get everything
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
perfect he's got to have other people
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
cross-check his work he's going to spend
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
some very long days
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
making sure he has everything perfect as
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
well as all the other
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
lba in the other division so
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
try to be sensitive and make sure we get
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
it ready so he doesn't have to work 20
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
hour days
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
and getting ready for the presentations
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
to the full house and the
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
so so i think that's a great comment and
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
and let me come back to you mr ripple
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
and say i'm i'm assuming
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
you've built in some time to sleep if we
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
get our work done on the 24th
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
i have i have and we will have time to
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
do uh data entry into the budget system
 
01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:29.590 align:start position:0%
do uh data entry into the budget system
and

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
all that over the weekend so there's
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
time built in for that
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
so so if you need this to be the 23rd
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
instead of the 24th you'll speak up
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
i will but the 24th should be fine
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
so representative nordgren you have your
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i was just looking at the calendar
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
here on my phone
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
and it looks like next week we would
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
only meet
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
two days i'm questioning
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
whether the house will be
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
having meetings maybe on town meeting
 
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.350 align:start position:0%
having meetings maybe on town meeting
day

01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's not in our calendar but i'm not
 
01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.790 align:start position:0%
that's not in our calendar but i'm not
sure

01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
we can't do virtual that day i also
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
um am unsure about the
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
three different house sessions on the
 
01:15:21.199 --> 01:15:21.830 align:start position:0%
three different house sessions on the
11th

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
11th
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's not what i've heard this house is
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
doing but
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
i don't have any communication with the
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
speaker so
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
um i just would maybe check on that
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
because i'm worried we're really going
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
to end up with some long days at the end
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
if we um don't do fridays
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
and we and we think we're having house
 
01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.110 align:start position:0%
and we and we think we're having house
sessions

01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so let me take that
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
last part first uh the house sessions
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh what i knew was what
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
is today tuesday what day are we it is
 
01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.470 align:start position:0%
is today tuesday what day are we it is
wednesday

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
wednesday's wednesday yeah okay so
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
welcome to our world so uh monday
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
or tuesday the speaker was going to be
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
um the sports center to coordinate
 
01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.110 align:start position:0%
um the sports center to coordinate
schedules

01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
schedules
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
and so i'm expecting any day now
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
any hour now for there to be a plan for
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
when we're going to go back into house
 
01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.229 align:start position:0%
when we're going to go back into house
session

01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
i think i think what mr ripple probably
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
did with these thursdays
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
is just put the house session question
 
01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
is just put the house session question
mark

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
mark
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
for us to just know that maybe we want
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
to stay away from
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
scheduling those days because um
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
we may end up having the house session
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
scheduled that day
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't think we're going to
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
have more than one or
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
two days at most in march if
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
for a house session that's that's what
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing uh
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative weiler do you want to
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
comment further on potential house
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
session days
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
well i'm also thinking of full committee
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
session days there's been some bills
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
passed on to us
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
most of them ended up in division one
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
when they get to them they're going to
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
have to come back before the committee
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
and have a vote have them forwarded
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
onto um the house
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
for a house session so even though we
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
haven't as far as i know gotten any of
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
the bills that were
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
passed this last session some of them
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
did go on in division one which will
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
require us to have a full session day at
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
some point
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do it in a half a day we'll
 
01:17:31.199 --> 01:17:32.310 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do it in a half a day we'll
see

01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
thanks do you want to tentatively
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh put your finger on one of the days in
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
march where we may have a full finance
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
committee day
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
or is that i don't want to put you on
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
the spot either well
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'll have to get together with lynn over
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
and see how she's coming on
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
fitting those bills into her schedule
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
and when she thinks she'll be done
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
very good and then representative
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
nordgren i recalled that she said two
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
things that i wanted to follow up on and
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
i did this
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
the other question is um the town
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
meeting day next tuesday
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
i'm unsure if the house will still be
 
01:18:15.679 --> 01:18:16.070 align:start position:0%
i'm unsure if the house will still be
here

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
meeting day is so i need an education
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
what is a town meeting day
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
voting oh i get it or towns or towns
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
but i don't know if that's the day we
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
need to take off if there are people
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
who are going to be involved in that or
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
if the house
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
has a full body is taking it off just
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
because of this virtual
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know i
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
i plan on anticipating i see i have
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
three towns so i'm going to try to get
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
to at least one of them
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay okay well you'll have to go
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
vote but it's not like any of us are
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
selectmen or
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
or registers of pro justices of the
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
checklist or anything that would require
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
us to spend the whole day there
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
quite often we have that happen but i
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't think any of the people
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
speak up if anybody is involved in a
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
town where they got to be there
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
at the polls all day so that's just how
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
i figure out what's going on in my town
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
and and well people grab me and talk to
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
me so
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
we're penciled in for uh nine o'clock on
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
the ninth
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute that's another division
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
all right so we're not penciled into
 
01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
all right so we're not penciled into
meat

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
meat
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
on we are not on the ninth no
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
do you wanna do you wanna pencil
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
something in in the afternoon
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
either morning or afternoon i don't
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
think we have to have we don't have to
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
have the whole day off but
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
so um i did not make sense to look at
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
the fridays before we look at that
 
01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.070 align:start position:0%
the fridays before we look at that
particular

01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
particular
day

01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know it just seems like
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
people are working on the weekends and
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
giving them some time to work on friday
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
kind of good but um would you rather do
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
so mary jane do you know when the gopher
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry uh represent weiler i have not
 
01:20:20.239 --> 01:20:21.270 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry uh represent weiler i have not
heard

01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
what time it is i figured that they know
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
they have both you and i to
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
to schedule a round i hope i hope so
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
so at least they maybe let us know a
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
little bit further in advance
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
yeah the other thing that you guys are
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
involved in is that joint fiscal
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
committee i think and
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not sure when the next one
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
is but those tend to be friday mornings
 
01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.550 align:start position:0%
is but those tend to be friday mornings
right

01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple if you could just add
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
that as a as a note
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
since it's putting demands on our
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee i have a thing on the 12th i
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
just realized as well
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
having spoken out okay
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
all right no beer for you fair enough
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay so so
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
so let's let's let's
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
jess sharon has a question
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
oh there it is yes go ahead
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative norton
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
no sorry i didn't hit my hand
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
sorry i opened a can of worms no it no
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's all good conversation i think i
 
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:30.950 align:start position:0%
it's all good conversation i think i
think

01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're smarter as a committee as a
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
result so
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
i think what we've done is we've added a
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
work session
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
on tuesday afternoon the 9th
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
and then what is our last hearing our
 
01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.669 align:start position:0%
and then what is our last hearing our
last

01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
hearing from the department is scheduled
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the 15th is that correct
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay now now so
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
that already includes a continuation of
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
public health
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
so so that's so we're probably good
 
01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:13.590 align:start position:0%
so so that's so we're probably good
right

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
you do you do you have any reason to for
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
concern that we don't have enough
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
department days scheduled
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
i think you have enough department day
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
scheduled and
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
five work sessions and the possibility
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
of opening up
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
and opening up the afternoon of the
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
ninth and possibly
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
thursdays and as well and which there
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
are no house sessions i think you have
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
enough time to do your work
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
okay so just keep in mind everyone on
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh i i i'm trainable i
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly what i'm doing but
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
i'm trainable talk to me
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh if you guys something mj i see
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
i see her but i was in a sentence so
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative walner on the ninth what
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
time do you think you'll
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
come in to work and how long do you
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
think you'll work i
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
because it looked like we were empty
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
that day that day i
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
scheduled something for that afternoon
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
so i'll tell you what what what's your
 
01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.510 align:start position:0%
so i'll tell you what what what's your
preference

01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
preference
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
i i think if we got together for a
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
couple hours
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
given that we still have division uh
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
that we need to hear
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
just i i just want to make sure that our
 
01:23:25.679 --> 01:23:26.070 align:start position:0%
just i i just want to make sure that our
our

01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
our ways of working together are coming
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
together and maybe two hours of
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
of talking and working with each other
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
will be useful just to learn
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
so so what what's your pleasure could we
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
come in
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
can we come in at noon and be done by
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
like three
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
two thirty to three i'm okay with that
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
do you have an issue with starting at
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
noon mr ripple
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
nope not at all i don't know what your
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
union contract says whether
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
i need to send you a sandwich if we do
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
that no
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
union okay all right so so we'll go
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
from noon to three and honestly i don't
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think we'll need
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
would like to tell you a little bit
 
01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:20.790 align:start position:0%
would like to tell you a little bit
about

01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
a conversation i had uh
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
with with some folks about the revenue
 
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.350 align:start position:0%
with with some folks about the revenue
estimates

01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
as you know um we've been talking
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
about uh an 80 million dollar shortfall
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
overall in the biennium between
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
the house ways and means revenue
 
01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.229 align:start position:0%
the house ways and means revenue
estimates

01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
and what the governor's budget
 
01:24:46.719 --> 01:24:48.470 align:start position:0%
and what the governor's budget
anticipates

01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
anticipates
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
and as a result of there being about it
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
i guess it's more precisely 77 million
 
01:24:54.239 --> 01:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
i guess it's more precisely 77 million
but

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
but in any case ways and means is
 
01:24:58.480 --> 01:24:59.750 align:start position:0%
but in any case ways and means is
projecting

01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
projecting
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
revenues and we're seeing a shortfall
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
between that and the governor's budget
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
we're getting feedback that
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
the governor office is very confident
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
in their revenue estimates more
 
01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.189 align:start position:0%
in their revenue estimates more
confident

01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
confident
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
than they are in the ways and means
 
01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.629 align:start position:0%
than they are in the ways and means
estimates

01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
and and so um
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
so while we will be looking for
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
ways to tighten the belt if we
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget or governor's
 
01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.229 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget or governor's
people

01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
won't be participating with us to a
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
great extent
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
so so we're going to have to do some
 
01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:45.030 align:start position:0%
so so we're going to have to do some
path

01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
path
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
finding on our own looking at
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
potential reductions
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
so that we're ready if the worst case
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
starts to appear
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but um but so i wanted
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
i wanted to open that up and let you
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
know that that's where we're at
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative weiler i have a lot of
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
faith in in the methods that
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
ways and means committee has used for
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
the past two or three budgets
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
and they have been very close and
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
we have of course put the budgets with
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
their revenues
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we've regretted it
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
whereas if we went with the governors i
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
think we would find ourselves short so
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
i think that you know within our own
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
family if you will
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
they're part of the legislature they're
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
the ones that are responsible they've
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
given us
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the pattern we go with
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
ways and means comes and tells us this
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
is what we think you'll have
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
they may come back and later in march
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
and say okay we can add another 10
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
000. but and then the senate goes to the
 
01:26:49.199 --> 01:26:49.990 align:start position:0%
000. but and then the senate goes to the
senate

01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
and march and april is sits key months
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
and the senate gets to look at them so
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
the senate may come back and say
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay we've got another 20 or 40 or 50
 
01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.110 align:start position:0%
okay we've got another 20 or 40 or 50
million

01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
and if that's the instance then we ought
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to say when we put things
 
01:27:05.199 --> 01:27:06.149 align:start position:0%
to be able to say when we put things
aside

01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
aside
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
the priority is on this one that we just
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
cut that's
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
that's the highest priority to put back
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
the money in there this is the third and
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
this is the fourth priority and whatever
 
01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
but so we can go to them and negotiate
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
and say you know
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay you had more money than we did but
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
we think you put it in the wrong place
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
we want to wish to say that rather than
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
put it there you should have put more
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
here and more
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
here and so on so that that's one we
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
keep in mind when we do
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
are forced to make cuts is prioritize
 
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
where we'd restore
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
that's the way the game is and that's
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
the way it's been going on for years and
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think kerry jane can agree and
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
then sharon norgren would say that's the
 
01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.870 align:start position:0%
then sharon norgren would say that's the
experience

01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative norgren
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
yes um i would just want to stress
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
that the ways and means committee and
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
just you can talk about this
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
will come to another discussion
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
about revenues um in a few weeks so
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
before we finish and i don't know
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
if you either you or representative
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
weiler know the time frame
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
um which might be helpful so
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
so go ahead representative weiler i
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
think you had an answer
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know yet when we'll hear
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
from that
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
adjustment by ways and means they would
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
probably want it as late in the month as
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
possible so they could
 
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
get they get to look at the most
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
parameters but
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes they will give us an adjustment for
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
along the line
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
and if as i say if we've made priorities
 
01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.030 align:start position:0%
and if as i say if we've made priorities
on

01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
okay we cut here but that's the one we
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
at least wanted to cut so
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's where we'll put the money
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
first so that's that's the kind of thing
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
why we want to keep track thank you
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
so so could we go back to
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
the uh ways and means chair and and say
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
um on the 24th of of march
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to be all done with the
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
division three
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
we would like you to give us your best
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
guess as of the 23rd
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
give us give us your your whatever
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
you're thinking on the 23rd
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
whether you're going to look at it again
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
in a week or two but just tell us what
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
you think on the 23rd
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'll have a conversation with him to
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
that effect
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay i mean all right
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
so that would it seems to me like that
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
would lay out a logical sequence i don't
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
know if ways and means
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
is could accommodate it but i i i hope
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
they could
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
i mean if nothing else they would say
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
you know whatever we voted in last
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
session is still their current estimate
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know but but if they're thinking
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
something different it'd be good to
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
to get an informal update i think there
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
might be some key report
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe the date of that key report
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
would trigger the whole thing so
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'll have that conversation thank you
 
01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.910 align:start position:0%
i'll have that conversation thank you
sir

01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
sir
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
um okay so um
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
so i i i think i'm done saying
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
everything i wanted to say
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
is there or for the good of the division
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
does anyone have anything
 
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
they want to talk about that has not
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
been raised
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that and ms rounds that includes you
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
oh i do have one more thing for you ms
 
01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.629 align:start position:0%
oh i do have one more thing for you ms
rounds

01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
rounds
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of times
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
as we were going through the
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
department's increments and decrements
 
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.229 align:start position:0%
department's increments and decrements
list

01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
i made a comment that sounded something
 
01:30:35.199 --> 01:30:36.229 align:start position:0%
i made a comment that sounded something
like

01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know i i understand your concept but
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
but we need something measurable to go
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
so that we we know what we'd be getting
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
if we add or subtract and
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh and and in other words i was looking
 
01:30:52.239 --> 01:30:52.709 align:start position:0%
uh and and in other words i was looking
for

01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
more specific metrics associated with
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
the five percent
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
increment or decrement than what many of
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
the slides
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
were sharing okay do you know if
 
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
people are working on giving us better
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
metrics around the increment
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
and decrement list yes if it was on the
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions list which i believe
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
that jonah provided me we we are working
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
on that i know at least chris
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
santaniello is for dehs
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
um so i'll make sure that
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
that if it's not on there for for katya
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
for behavioral health that we do
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
um add it on there jonah so that we make
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
sure we get it to you
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll mention it to the future
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
presenters as well
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay i know we've asked for a lot of
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
things but as we're as we're just kind
 
01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:39.750 align:start position:0%
things but as we're as we're just kind
of

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
taking a look at the big picture here
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
that the details on the increment and
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
decrement list are really going to be
 
01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:49.110 align:start position:0%
decrement list are really going to be
important

01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right so um i'll try again
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
anything for the good of this vision
 
01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.070 align:start position:0%
anything for the good of this vision
anyone

01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh let's do one last opportunity for the
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
attendees to raise their hand
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
in case somebody's got something to make
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
us a smarter better
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
public servant so
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
i'll give you about 20 seconds to try to
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
figure out how to raise your hand
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not i'm not seeing any so
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need a motion to
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
adjourn uh but i'm uh i'm ready to
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
adjourn are there any vetoes anyone want
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
to keep going
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
all right all right uh well thank you mr
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
ripley you had one last thing
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
so you did plan on coming back at one
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the last of the presentations
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah yeah one o'clock yep so i
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
think you would recess until one o'clock
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay so this is a recess until one
 
01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.550 align:start position:0%
okay so this is a recess until one
o'clock

01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for that sure
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
um the establishment of the 10-year plan
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh mental health plan so i like that
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
graphic and
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
someday it might be interesting to put
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
sort of your best estimate of population
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
numbers in each of the bubbles
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we have some another sense of
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
of how how big an issue we've got
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
that is a really good point we um talk
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
about numbers in our briefing book
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and so the we always have that issue
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
of how many do we actually serve through
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
the publicly funded
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
system and how do we capture or quantify
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
those who fall out of the department's
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
purview so to speak for
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
funding of services but at the very
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
least i think you can refer to the
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
briefing book
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
which does break down the numbers served
 
01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:56.790 align:start position:0%
which does break down the numbers served
in

01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
so you can see um and we've talked about
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
this previously
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
both with the new hampshire hospital
 
01:34:09.199 --> 01:34:10.629 align:start position:0%
both with the new hampshire hospital
presentation

01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
and um on monday about the
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
increases that we're seeing and the
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
people who are seeking
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
services so the good news is they're
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
engaged in
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
services and the bad news is we're
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
seeing a
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
increased demand so this number 15
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
763 or 33
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
those are spread out amongst those five
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
bubbles or is that in
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
one particular bubble
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
so that is not so let's just go back and
 
01:34:43.119 --> 01:34:43.510 align:start position:0%
so that is not so let's just go back and
look

01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
so those would be the ones who are more
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
likely to be
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the top three so the three to the
 
01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.590 align:start position:0%
in the top three so the three to the
right

01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
um so those are the ones we
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
use that data from the community mental
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
health centers
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
and so that is where the provision of
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
those types of services
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh happens so outpatient treatment um
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
not so much the step up and step down
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
but um the crisis
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
and inpatient services so um
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah you know community education as
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
always that's
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
we think of it as population education
 
01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:21.990 align:start position:0%
we think of it as population education
population

01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
health and that is as broad a category
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
so this goes breaks it down a little bit
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
you saw this on monday
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
for children's behavioral health it does
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
it by eligibility category
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
and again shows the same level of
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
each of those categories and i'm sorry
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's hard to read that slide
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'm realizing either that or i need to
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
put on my glasses
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.159 --> 01:36:09.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
that's a big number of serious
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
and um we're you know we're prepared to
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
go uh talk to you about what that means
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
there's a definition that's in
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
law and it's also commonly used
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
and part of the everyone's definition
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
federal definition of what severe mental
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
illness is and what
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
so this really talks about what the
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the bureau
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
is in overseeing the provision of these
 
01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.109 align:start position:0%
is in overseeing the provision of these
services

01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
i would be remiss if i didn't recognize
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
that i'm not
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
sitting here just representing the
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
bureau but i'm also also representing
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
the dozens and dozens
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
of community service providers who are
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
actively working um today um
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
to address the needs as well as the
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
thousands of individuals who need our
 
01:37:13.679 --> 01:37:14.950 align:start position:0%
thousands of individuals who need our
services

01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
and so we break it down you'll see
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
as we talked about on monday
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
there are 10 centers situated
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
in geographic locations throughout the
 
01:37:28.159 --> 01:37:29.590 align:start position:0%
in geographic locations throughout the
state

01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
you all have them in your districts
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
and hopefully you know them and if you
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
don't it would be great for you to
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
connect with them or
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
them to connect with you to talk more in
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
more detail about the types of services
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
that they provide
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
so they have the outpatient services
 
01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:47.990 align:start position:0%
so they have the outpatient services
emergency

01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
services we have the mobile crisis
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
response teams we talked about monday
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
and those
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
are for adults and they include four
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
respite beds in each of those three
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
regions which include
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
concord manchester and nashua
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that is the program that we want to
 
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.030 align:start position:0%
and that is the program that we want to
integrate

01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
integrate
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
and expand and have all populations
 
01:38:12.239 --> 01:38:13.189 align:start position:0%
and expand and have all populations
served

01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
served
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
and have it be a statewide system
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
so are all the mobile uh systems
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
so hmm that's a good question i think i
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
will have to ask
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
jane to answer that because i think we
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
have the mobile crisis
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
that are currently in existence are in
 
01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.709 align:start position:0%
that are currently in existence are in
our

01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
current budget and carry forth
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
but then dollars were added um
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
to expand and i believe that we had
 
01:38:47.679 --> 01:38:49.750 align:start position:0%
to expand and i believe that we had
dollars

01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
put into both the bureau of children's
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
and this particular bureau and jane
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
could you just validate that
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
yes yep you're correct there is money in
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
4117 our accounting unit here in mental
 
01:39:04.159 --> 01:39:04.790 align:start position:0%
4117 our accounting unit here in mental
health

01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
and there's also money in 2053
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the children's behavioral health
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you didn't hear me uh i you
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
started i heard i i heard you up until
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
you said the first half and then i
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear you after that
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay so there's money in the accounting
 
01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:27.629 align:start position:0%
okay so there's money in the accounting
unit

01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
4117 which resides in mental health
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
which is where we're at and there's also
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
money in 2053 which was talked about
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
on monday in the children's behavioral
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
health section okay so are these mobile
 
01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.629 align:start position:0%
health section okay so are these mobile
crisis

01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry uh i thought you were done
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's okay go ahead
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
so are these mobile crisis teams are
 
01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:50.790 align:start position:0%
so are these mobile crisis teams are
they

01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh significantly different from one
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
another to where one has
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
a more of a pediatric bent to it and one
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
has a more adult bent to it
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
or are they sort of uh
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
like swiss army knives and can handle
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
any psychiatric crisis
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
so thank you that's a great question
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
because going forward we're going to
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
be all encompassing um and that's what
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
we're working to put in place right now
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
statewide right now these three
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
particular teams
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
are comprised as
 
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
laid out in our community mental health
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
agreement the amanda d
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
settlement which we
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
work with closely with the plaintiffs on
 
01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.229 align:start position:0%
work with closely with the plaintiffs on
overseeing

01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
overseeing
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
and maintaining a component of that
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
really dictates and it was agreed upon
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
what those tunes would look like and
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
who from a certification
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
and professional standpoint serves on
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
those teams
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
including peer peers who serve on those
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
each of the three areas have taken
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a slight slightly different
 
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.790 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a slight slightly different
approach

01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
um however they stay within that main
 
01:41:07.119 --> 01:41:07.910 align:start position:0%
um however they stay within that main
framework

01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
framework
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the agree that's called for in the
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
agreement so while
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
manchester may um be able to respond to
 
01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:14.950 align:start position:0%
manchester may um be able to respond to
children

01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
the other two are unlikely to do that
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
only because we fund them to support the
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
adult uh population and
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
agreement

01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
the specialty services there's
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
residential services
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
reap when i saw that i'm like oh no
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's an
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
acronym we didn't spell out so that's
 
01:41:43.199 --> 01:41:43.990 align:start position:0%
acronym we didn't spell out so that's
referral

01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
referral
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
education assistance and
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
prevention and that really serves the
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
adult population
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
um and if anybody well you couldn't have
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
been but on this morning
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
on the exchange they talked about this
 
01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.030 align:start position:0%
on the exchange they talked about this
program

01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
specifically it's for individuals who
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
are in congregate care as well
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
as in the community and it is um
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
for adults 60 plus
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
so we have deaf and hard of hearing
 
01:42:16.639 --> 01:42:17.910 align:start position:0%
so we have deaf and hard of hearing
services

01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
and first episode psychosis
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
and that fep is how we refer to that
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
that really is trying to
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
provide that early intervention when
 
01:42:29.679 --> 01:42:30.550 align:start position:0%
provide that early intervention when
someone

01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
first experiences a mental health crisis
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
and then the last one is a grant that a
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
federal grant that we have
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
pro-health integrated health care for
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
youth um specifically targeting that
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
particular age group which we talked
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
about again
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
on monday and that is looking at
 
01:42:53.679 --> 01:42:55.270 align:start position:0%
on monday and that is looking at
integrating

01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
integrating
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
physical health and mental health
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
services together
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
so there are many mental health centers
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
that have partnered with their federally
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
qualified health centers to really
 
01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:08.390 align:start position:0%
qualified health centers to really
provide

01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
the what we all would like to see is the
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
integration and not have
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
separate um services or separate
 
01:43:15.199 --> 01:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
separate um services or separate
approaches

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
approaches
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
for mental health and for physical
 
01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:24.629 align:start position:0%
for mental health and for physical
health

01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's a question there with the
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative nordron thank you very
 
01:43:28.159 --> 01:43:28.790 align:start position:0%
representative nordron thank you very
much

01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm particularly concerned about the
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
north country
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
um could you address any
 
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
um programs or new availability of
 
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:40.790 align:start position:0%
um programs or new availability of
services

01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
up in the north country obviously the
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
three units are really
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
right where our population is but i
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
think the north country isolation
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
i think is a big concern to a lot of
 
01:43:53.199 --> 01:43:53.750 align:start position:0%
i think is a big concern to a lot of
people

01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
thanks so you're going right to the
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
heart where my heart always is which is
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
the north country
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
i have an affinity for that area knowing
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
the challenges there however we do have
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
a statewide system
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
so the community mental health center
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
there has the same
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
level of services as the rest of the
 
01:44:14.639 --> 01:44:15.590 align:start position:0%
level of services as the rest of the
state

01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
the mobile response teams specifically
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
were targeted
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
because of the volumes and the
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
utilization as determined
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
through that period when we were
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
settling that court
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
case and so it was negotiated and
 
01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:34.709 align:start position:0%
case and so it was negotiated and
determined

01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
that those three areas were in the
 
01:44:37.199 --> 01:44:37.990 align:start position:0%
that those three areas were in the
highest

01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
highest
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
need from a numbers count
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
we have worked really closely with eric
 
01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.149 align:start position:0%
we have worked really closely with eric
johnson

01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
johnson
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
from northern human services
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
to look at his population
 
01:44:53.590 --> 01:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
differently due to geography so while we
 
01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:54.070 align:start position:0%
differently due to geography so while we
have

01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
assertive community treatment teams
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
so those are called act services and
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
those are high intense
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
services for individuals um needed
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
at that level on ongoing um
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
he we have worked with him so that he
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
has uh
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
more than one team so while the other
 
01:45:14.719 --> 01:45:15.590 align:start position:0%
more than one team so while the other
centers

01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
centers
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the most part have one team although
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
manchester is the exception to that
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
um we've worked with northern human
 
01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:23.910 align:start position:0%
um we've worked with northern human
services

01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they had geographic
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
coverage so that nobody
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
is stuck um in littleton um
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
needing to seek services in conway for
 
01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:36.149 align:start position:0%
needing to seek services in conway for
example

01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
but it is something that we monitor very
 
01:45:38.159 --> 01:45:39.189 align:start position:0%
but it is something that we monitor very
closely

01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
closely
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
and we know that um
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
that is an area that we need to continue
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
so the middle one about housing services
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
i think everyone
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
is acutely aware of the housing crisis
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire as
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
evidenced by
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
the individuals who are homeless and by
 
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
just the tight
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh real estate market that we're reading
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
about every single day
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
so these housing services are specific
 
01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:19.189 align:start position:0%
so these housing services are specific
for

01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
individuals with severe mental illness
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
that are in need of more support than
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
so transitional housing they need more
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
support than
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
just having a place to
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
stay so to speak so we have specialty
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
residential transitional housing many
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
people are aware that we have
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
transitional housing run by
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
nfi we're bringing up that acronym again
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
here in concord on pleasant street
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
where the state offices are we have
 
01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.750 align:start position:0%
where the state offices are we have
other

01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
beds that are in housing programs that
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
are available
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
in a couple other parts of the state and
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're standing continuing to stand up
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
additional programs
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
the housing bridge subsidy program is
 
01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:12.390 align:start position:0%
the housing bridge subsidy program is
more

01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
a traditional um approach where
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
we're able to provide a so-called
 
01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
we're able to provide a so-called
voucher

01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
voucher
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
to an individual who qualifies
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
and this bridge in the whole point of a
 
01:47:26.159 --> 01:47:27.109 align:start position:0%
and this bridge in the whole point of a
bridge

01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
is that it is someone who's eligible for
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
section 8
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
housing however they are going to be
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
waiting and waiting and waiting to
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
receive that section 8 housing
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
subsidy so we bridge that time between
 
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
when they are in need of housing and
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
when they're going to be able to secure
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
that federal section aid housing so
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
um there are currently
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
we are in contract for 500
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
apartments for leasing up
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
we have many of those individuals come
 
01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.470 align:start position:0%
we have many of those individuals come
from

01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital and so when
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
heather marquin was speaking
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
about needing to find the so-called back
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
door and needing to work on that i think
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
she a couple times referenced to bridge
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
the bridge program well that's this
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
program and with that program
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
with the community mental health centers
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
and by our bureau
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
and the there is a sliding fee scale so
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
we only pay i think it's 689
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
a month um and there you know that's not
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
going to go very far in the seacoast
 
01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:43.910 align:start position:0%
going to go very far in the seacoast
probably

01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
um or anywhere right now so we do have
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
the ability to waive that
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
um if someone has an income then we
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
what question um help me put
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
500 apartments in context because i know
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
a very high occupancy rate in
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
apartments so it feels to me like
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
500 statewide is
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
a really significant percentage of our
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
vacancies so
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
this program goes back a dozen years or
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
more and
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
um it has been very successful in the
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
way that it's been administered
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
in the development of relationships
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's always been 500 no
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
it just increased by 75 slots due to the
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
funding in the last um budget um
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium we were just able
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
to go to contract to increase
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
by 75. we are
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
that's all right i i thought it was a
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
bigger issue i thought you were
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to take 500 more new
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
units so you're just taking 75 more
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
to get to five up to 500 yeah so
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
administrator i just want to rep
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative waller has a question
 
01:50:14.239 --> 01:50:18.229 align:start position:0%
representative waller has a question
sure

01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
so katya i don't know if this is a good
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
time or not
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
for you to talk for a little a minute
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
about the community mental health
 
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.350 align:start position:0%
about the community mental health
agreement

01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
um sort of what i mean i don't know i
 
01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:31.270 align:start position:0%
um sort of what i mean i don't know i
don't

01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
i need a refresher as to what all was in
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
there and i do know that the expert
 
01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:38.719 align:start position:0%
reviewer reviews us on a regular basis
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
wondered how how we were doing when i
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
looked last time
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
it seemed that way there were some areas
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
that we were still
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
um not not quite there yet so
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
could you when the appropriate time uh
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
if you could talk a little bit about
 
01:50:56.239 --> 01:50:57.430 align:start position:0%
if you could talk a little bit about
that

01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
well on this slide um there are a lot of
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
things here that
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
um are the backbone of the
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
agreement and what we are standing up
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
for services and have stood up so the
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
housing bridge is a perfect example of
 
01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:11.830 align:start position:0%
housing bridge is a perfect example of
that

01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
um it called for x number of slots to be
 
01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:16.229 align:start position:0%
um it called for x number of slots to be
available

01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
that we were to achieve that and we were
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
given a ramp-up period over
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
three or four years and so um i believe
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
that 500 number
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
now exceeds what was in the agreement
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
however the agreement also indicates
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we would seek additional funding
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
if a waitlist were developed and
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
right now the wait list is relatively
 
01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.390 align:start position:0%
right now the wait list is relatively
manageable

01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
manageable
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
but we know with the way things are
 
01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:45.990 align:start position:0%
but we know with the way things are
going

01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
and with new hampshire hospital having
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
trouble with that
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
back door that that that's an area that
 
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
we need to focus on
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
so the premise of the suit was that
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was um unnecessarily
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
um institutionalizing individuals with
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
severe mental illness
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
due to the lack of community services
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
we were the lawsuit was filed by the u.s
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
and the disability rights center and
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
um there's another organization that's
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
also involved
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
and so we were able to come to an
 
01:52:27.119 --> 01:52:28.470 align:start position:0%
and so we were able to come to an
agreement

01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
it was funded in a special session i
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
believe it was 2013.
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
um we started getting some funding for
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
this it was uh
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
off budget year so that was difficult
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
but we were able to do that
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
and the components of it is really
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
looking at community-based services
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
so who from new hampshire hospital
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be there
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
if but for the community services if
 
01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:56.629 align:start position:0%
if but for the community services if
they

01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
if they have access to community
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
services the other
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
population that's addressed is the going
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
club home so you heard
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh todd bickford talk about glencliff
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
and um we
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
were obligated under the agreement and
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
were successful
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
in transitioning 16 individuals
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
out of ground club home into
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
community-based settings
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of details about the
 
01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.229 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of details about the
definitions

01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to share the agreement
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
as well as the latest
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
expert reviewer report that was just
 
01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:34.470 align:start position:0%
expert reviewer report that was just
issued

01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
issued
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
in jean at the end of january and so
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
it has major categories of what we need
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
to provide in services
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
including housing including those three
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis teams
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
including a number to have the capacity
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
to serve 1500 individuals statewide
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
for the assertive community
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
treatment which i indicated before which
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
intensive service typically someone who
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
is on an team needs ongoing
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
long-term support and intense
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
services and those are likely to be
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
individuals who are transitioning
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire hospital and
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
that capacity is one area that we
 
01:54:24.159 --> 01:54:25.109 align:start position:0%
that capacity is one area that we
continuously

01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
continuously
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
struggle with in not having um 1500
 
01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:29.830 align:start position:0%
struggle with in not having um 1500
people

01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
who have um we haven't achieved that
 
01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:33.430 align:start position:0%
who have um we haven't achieved that
number

01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
of serving 1500 we've been hovering
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
around the same amount
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
for several years and we've had
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
discussions about
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
whether there really is the need um to
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
build that much capacity or if other
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
types of services
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
would be um
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to serve the same
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
individuals that would be
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
served by act but at a different um a
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
your hand is still up do you have
 
01:55:03.679 --> 01:55:05.510 align:start position:0%
your hand is still up do you have
follow-ups

01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
follow-ups
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
no i i want to say i want to thank katja
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
and if it's possible i i think i know i
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
see the agreement again and i don't have
 
01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:18.870 align:start position:0%
see the agreement again and i don't have
it

01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm right here on my desk so i'm sure
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
you do
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
so maybe other people would like to see
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
it too so you can sort of read through
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
it to see
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
what the uh the state's responsibilities
 
01:55:31.199 --> 01:55:32.950 align:start position:0%
what the uh the state's responsibilities
are

01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
so i think that falls under our general
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
way of distrib
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
distributing documents mr ripple catches
 
01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:39.830 align:start position:0%
distributing documents mr ripple catches
them

01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
and makes sure we all have them and if
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate it gets
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
how how long are we under this agreement
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
miss fox
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
until we achieve um the all the
 
01:56:00.070 --> 01:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
components and come into compliance
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
and so it was originally envisioned to
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
be five years
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's now been um closing i think it's
 
01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:07.430 align:start position:0%
it's now been um closing i think it's
been

01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:56:10.709 --> 01:56:10.719 align:start position:0%
six or seven years um i think it was
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
um i can't remember if it was 2013
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
yet was signed or february of 2014 and i
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
pull it out from my pile um
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
we um have we've gone past the five
 
01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:25.510 align:start position:0%
we um have we've gone past the five
years

01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
is the bottom line and we continue to
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
have that expert reviewer
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
monitor um for a number of things
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
including an expectation around quality
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
and we will only
 
01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
not be under the agreement when we
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
achieve the goals
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
and come into compliance and then it's
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
monitored for one year
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
that we maintain that for one year
 
01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
and so we're in it for
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
i don't see any more questions you can
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
drive on
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay peer recovery we talked about this
 
01:57:15.599 --> 01:57:15.990 align:start position:0%
okay peer recovery we talked about this
with

01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
um the um individuals with a substance
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
use disorder
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is also a really big component of
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
the mental health system
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
we have eight agencies that have 14
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
locations that are in
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
each of the regions those 10 regions
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
again these are lean organizations that
 
01:57:37.599 --> 01:57:38.390 align:start position:0%
again these are lean organizations that
have

01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
some paid staff but many volunteers as
 
01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:42.550 align:start position:0%
some paid staff but many volunteers as
well

01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
and they are trained and
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
they have office hours so they're
 
01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:49.830 align:start position:0%
they have office hours so they're
they're

01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
in person drop-in centers and
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
they they're a key like i said a key
 
01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:59.589 align:start position:0%
they they're a key like i said a key
component

01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
component
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
we have family peer support um as well
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
so that we can assist families as they
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
try to assist their
 
01:58:12.070 --> 01:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
we have the inpatient so all of a sudden
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're skipping
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
we're going from one level to um
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
the acute level and so in addition to
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital new hampshire
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
hospital is designated
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
as a designated receiving facility
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
so those beds are known as drf beds
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
we have community-based drf beds
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
and those are located in manchester at
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
elliott hospital
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
and the cypress center which has um
 
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's under the
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
mental health center of manchester we
 
01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:48.870 align:start position:0%
mental health center of manchester we
have

01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
in nashua we have them franklin
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
derry and portsmouth and we're
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
frequently looking to expand that
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
and then the other is guardianship
 
01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:11.990 align:start position:0%
and then the other is guardianship
services

01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
if you recall in on monday one of my
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
early slides was
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
talking about the need for 10 additional
 
01:59:18.639 --> 01:59:19.270 align:start position:0%
talking about the need for 10 additional
slots

01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
slots
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
and you questioned that it was only 30
 
01:59:22.239 --> 01:59:22.870 align:start position:0%
and you questioned that it was only 30
000

01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
as a prioritized need and that is indeed
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
the case
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that service and again those
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
are guardians that are appointed
 
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
um to help individuals
 
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
with basic life skills
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
and overseeing their finances and
 
01:59:46.149 --> 01:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
okay so that's everything i remember
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
from the guardianship i don't think i
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
asked you how many clients can one
 
01:59:54.159 --> 01:59:56.830 align:start position:0%
asked you how many clients can one
guardian

01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
service so
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
now julian gets to be on camera if she
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
knows but
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
um i do know that we have contracts
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
with two um
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
agencies organizations that and one is
 
02:00:12.719 --> 02:00:14.149 align:start position:0%
agencies organizations that and one is
um

02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
the office of the public guardian um but
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
julianne do you know the answer to that
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
question of how many they serve
 
02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
i know um we can get that if if you
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
don't have it it's not urgent
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
yeah as you said it's under their
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
contract so we contract them for a
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
particular number of slots but i don't
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
have that information
 
02:00:36.070 --> 02:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
right in front of me if we can follow up
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking through my my notes to
 
02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:44.950 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking through my my notes to
see

02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm just thinking aloud you know
 
02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
that that's got to be
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
one of the most cost
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
effective i don't know if it's
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
clinically effective but
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
it it or the extent to which it's
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
clinically effective but that
 
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
sounds like one of the least expensive
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
ways that we can
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
help our clients so i do have a little
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
bit of information that i used um
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
to flip to the page so the per diem
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
payments for guardians
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
is 8.25 and
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
um in one contract and the other is six
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
dollars and
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
81 cents in our case loads
 
02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
and this includes for individuals with
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
an intellectual disability as well
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
um our case loads for state fiscal year
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
20 were 1035
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
and we expect um in that to increase by
 
02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:42.109 align:start position:0%
and we expect um in that to increase by
about

02:01:42.109 --> 02:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
and i will say this is an area that we
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
often have to transfer
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
funds because we're obligated to provide
 
02:02:00.790 --> 02:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
these services
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
and um so so we're always looking
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
gap

02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
so this really just gives a coverage map
 
02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
for the mental health region
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
so again probably can't see it
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
um but um you can blow it up on the um
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
on the screen with your individual um
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
documents that were uh shared with you
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
via email i believe
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
so we have 10 uh community mental health
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
programs up
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's what the map covers um we have a
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
community mental health provider
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's the aforementioned nfi we have
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
the eight
 
02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
peer support agencies with 14 locations
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
we have the family mutual support agency
 
02:03:01.199 --> 02:03:01.669 align:start position:0%
we have the family mutual support agency
which

02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:03:04.709 --> 02:03:04.719 align:start position:0%
um is ken norton's
 
02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
group tsunami new hampshire um we have
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
the suicide prevention line and i know
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
this was raised i believe by
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative norgren
 
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
on monday about the funding that went to
 
02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:16.870 align:start position:0%
on monday about the funding that went to
headrest

02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
headrest
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
um so that was the first time in the
 
02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:20.070 align:start position:0%
um so that was the first time in the
last

02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
biennium that was funded state funds
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
going for the suicide prevention line
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
and so we have hundred thousand dollars
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's one contract
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
with headrests to provide that service
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
we have the designated receiving
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that we talked about
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
we have the legal services that we just
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
and then we have some technical
 
02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
assistance training that's provided to
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
um all of our providers and in some
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
cases to the community
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i think we we
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't really hear you there
 
02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:10.719 align:start position:0%
oh i i think i am having some internet
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
problems but
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
um uh i'm just curious on a time check
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
how much time do we need to adequately
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
address these slides
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
i i i i in the back of my head i think
 
02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
somebody on the committee
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
said they needed to leave today at three
 
02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:28.149 align:start position:0%
said they needed to leave today at three
o'clock

02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
and and and i don't know if i'm just
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
confusing that with
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative walner tomorrow or or
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
what but
 
02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
but does does anyone have to leave
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
prior to three o'clock i
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
show a 2 30 uh meeting with with the lba
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think there's a 2 30
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
meeting with mike kane that
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
you representative edwards and
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay so uh and then i have to present
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
testimony at two so so representative
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
earth if you'll
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
get get on deck to to take over cheering
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh but if if
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
if we could move through the slides just
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit faster you're doing great
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm asking you a lot of questions so
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
um i realize i'm part of the problem but
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
let's try to go yeah and um i can pretty
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
much guarantee that we can toggle this
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
any way that you'd like um and
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
certainly be finished in the next half
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
hour or so depending on
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
questions i could talk about this all
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
day every day
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
um so so if you need to
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
just start waving at me and tell me to
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
so the key accomplishments this is
 
02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:45.510 align:start position:0%
so the key accomplishments this is
looking

02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
looking
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
at the expansion of the system where we
 
02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:48.870 align:start position:0%
at the expansion of the system where we
got

02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
um the opportunity to invest in
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan so the 10-year plan was
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
established and then we received the
 
02:05:56.239 --> 02:05:57.270 align:start position:0%
established and then we received the
investments

02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
investments
 
02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so we were able to do many of these
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
items that you see listed here as a
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
result of that
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity so we
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
added the drf beds to the system
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
again always looking to do that to
 
02:06:14.239 --> 02:06:14.950 align:start position:0%
again always looking to do that to
expand

02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
expand
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
those beds as you know today's wait list
 
02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:19.270 align:start position:0%
those beds as you know today's wait list
unfortunately

02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
hit that 60 number
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
that we were fearful of and so we want
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
to expand those services
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
and we're in the process of um
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
procuring for additional step up and
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
stuff down
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh beds we've added um beds for
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
the peers of the peer agencies are
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
running those respite beds
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
um and and so on so
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking at expansion there
 
02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:51.830 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking at expansion there
um

02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have the crisis response system
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
you've heard about that previously
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
about what our vision is with that with
 
02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
that hub
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
serving as the central portal and then
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
working in the regions to have the
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
crisis response
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
this is really important because ken
 
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
norton from nami raised it and i just
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
want to put a little
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
emphasis on it 988 is the federally
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
designated phone number
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
for suicide prevention um and
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
as ken talked about we'd love to see
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
that encompass and be all encompassing
 
02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:27.189 align:start position:0%
that encompass and be all encompassing
for

02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
all on mental health services and be
 
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
collapse those dozens and dozens of
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
numbers so that
 
02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
individuals and families have access to
 
02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
one number similar to what
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
we know for covid response right now is
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
two one one
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
so we were able to um
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
apply for and receive a grant
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it's a planning grant to get ready
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
for that 2022
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
rollout and we have funding that's
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
available to headrest
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
and so we'll be contracting with
 
02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:03.990 align:start position:0%
and so we'll be contracting with
headrest

02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
headrest
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
to really do that due diligence with
 
02:08:06.719 --> 02:08:07.589 align:start position:0%
to really do that due diligence with
planning

02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
planning
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
and that includes planning with the
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
around 9-1-1 what happens when a number
 
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
comes into 988 and it should go to 9-1-1
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
or vice versa it's coordinating with
 
02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:22.310 align:start position:0%
or vice versa it's coordinating with
2-1-1

02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
2-1-1
 
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
and other hotlines and
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
parties that would be interested in
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
that we're really taking into
 
02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:33.430 align:start position:0%
that we're really taking into
consideration

02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
how people access services
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
so we also in the budget in addition to
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
that two hundred thousand dollars
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
there was funding set aside for suicide
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
prevention that was
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
um pretty wide open the suicide
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
prevention council
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
asked us to hire someone and establish a
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
position within the department
 
02:08:58.709 --> 02:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
to be the suicide prevention coordinator
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
to work really closely
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
with the council in carrying out its
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
mission and
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
its strategic plan and that person
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
is going to start um in i think
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
next week or the week after um so we're
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
establish that and then we've also been
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
doing a number of
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
trainings and working on
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
a statewide campaign to
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
really get that information out there
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
that there is help
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
um and that people don't have to
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
so again we were able to move the bridge
 
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
subsidy program
 
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
from one administrator to the community
 
02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:43.350 align:start position:0%
from one administrator to the community
level

02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
so the community mental health centers
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
were very excited and we were excited
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
that they took on
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
the ability to work locally with their
 
02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
landlords in their communities
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to help the individuals in
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
their region secure that housing
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
so this type of housing is not
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
you go to a big building um that is for
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
all individuals with severe mental
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
illness this is
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
really integration into the community
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
and finding
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
apartments and working with landlords
 
02:10:18.629 --> 02:10:18.639 align:start position:0%
so that they understand the value
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
of being able to provide that type of
 
02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:23.350 align:start position:0%
of being able to provide that type of
housing

02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
and knowing that the committee mental
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
health center is providing that support
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
and then again a focus on peer
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
support and making sure that peers are
 
02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:38.069 align:start position:0%
support and making sure that peers are
available

02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
to individuals and not just having
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
and workforce workforce workforce we're
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
going to keep bringing it up
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
so um under key challenge oh i should
 
02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
so um under key challenge oh i should
pause

02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
pause
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry oh there's uh representative
 
02:10:58.239 --> 02:10:58.790 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry oh there's uh representative
nordron

02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
nordron
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
yes question i just
 
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a bit of trivia come in
 
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:06.550 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a bit of trivia come in
um

02:11:06.550 --> 02:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:11.550 --> 02:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
headrest was started um in
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
1969 by students in the
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
basement of a dartmouth door so
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
it goes way back to that
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
genesis here on campus at dartmouth just
 
02:11:24.719 --> 02:11:25.270 align:start position:0%
genesis here on campus at dartmouth just
trivia

02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
trivia
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.149 --> 02:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
were you part of that sharon what were
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
you part of that dartmouth basement
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
group no no no
 
02:11:45.669 --> 02:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
all right so key challenges and
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
a significant program that we've been
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
able to invest in
 
02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
it was basically very underfunded and
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of work
 
02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
and now is being able to grow to meet
 
02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
the demand
 
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
so we're pleased about being able to
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
partner with them
 
02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
so again back to the challenges
 
02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
affordable housing we've talked about it
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
we know about it
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
the council on housing stability that
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
was established by the governor
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
and of which many housing providers
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
and community service providers
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
sit on is looking at this and looking at
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
specific populations including the
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
populations that our division
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
service the
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
workforce again um this was
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
discussed previously and we'll continue
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
to sorry can
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
can we go to the next slide i i i would
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
like to keep us moving and these
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
challenges are
 
02:12:47.669 --> 02:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
are we we've talked about these before
 
02:12:48.950 --> 02:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
and they're indeed
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
serious challenges sure
 
02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
so now this is the um budget chart
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe karen um shines in here
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
and jane can as well if you have
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
questions sure
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
so the um the changes that i would
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
mention here
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
the the decrease in federal funds was
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
the end
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
of the uh disrip dish p waiver
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
um so that's what the reduction in
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
federal funds are there that we've ever
 
02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:18.310 align:start position:0%
federal funds are there that we've ever
ended

02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
ended
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
12 31 of 2020
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
so the federal funds are less um the
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
increase in general funds that you're
 
02:13:26.159 --> 02:13:26.629 align:start position:0%
increase in general funds that you're
seeing

02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
are the 10-year mental health plan that
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
katya has been
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sure talking about yeah i think
 
02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:33.270 align:start position:0%
i'm sure talking about yeah i think
we've

02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
we've
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
um have access to that 10-year mental
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
health plan
 
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
um already but if we could put a link
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
on the lba site miss ripple would
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:54.069 --> 02:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
i i saw you say yes with your head so
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
what else about this slide ms rounds i
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't think i have anything else though
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:12.550 --> 02:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is probably
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
something you want to skip over to
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
because you've seen this some of this
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
um uh about what we would be able to do
 
02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:19.350 align:start position:0%
um uh about what we would be able to do
with

02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
um five percent more and what would
 
02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
happen if we
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
go five percent less i will point out
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
always concerned about making sure that
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
the funding necessary to carry out the
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
requirements under the committee mental
 
02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:36.149 align:start position:0%
requirements under the committee mental
health

02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
agreement so
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
so like for example on the decrement
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
where you say a reduction would
 
02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:44.149 align:start position:0%
where you say a reduction would
necessarily

02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
necessitate a reduction of non-medicaid
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
billable services
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
are you also implying from what you just
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
said that it could cause us to
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
be out of compliance with our agreement
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
it could um many of the components of
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
the agreement
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
require general funds so housing is not
 
02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
something that we can um
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
bill medicaid for there are some
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
services that
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
can be but actual bricks and mortar and
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
um the leasing of that apartment
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
so to speak um is not something that
 
02:15:22.149 --> 02:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
there's any other funding for
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
so you know my general comment on this
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
the more that this is understandable in
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
terms of measurables
 
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
the the more useful it is to the
 
02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:32.950 align:start position:0%
the the more useful it is to the
committee

02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:15:36.310 --> 02:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
so i like for example the third bullet
 
02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:39.430 align:start position:0%
so i like for example the third bullet
down

02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
on increments because you start to talk
 
02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:42.709 align:start position:0%
on increments because you start to talk
about

02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
actual staff numbers and what they do
 
02:15:45.679 --> 02:15:46.069 align:start position:0%
actual staff numbers and what they do
but

02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
if you could help us further by you know
 
02:15:49.119 --> 02:15:50.629 align:start position:0%
if you could help us further by you know
what

02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
what does improving compliance mean
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't that doesn't say much uh
 
02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:57.830 align:start position:0%
that doesn't that doesn't say much uh
and

02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
tangible i mean i mean i know what
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're getting at but you will see
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
that um as part of the 10-year plan
 
02:16:08.709 --> 02:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
refresher that
 
02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
um you're going to have the link to that
 
02:16:11.910 --> 02:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
there is a huge
 
02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
emphasis on that quality um so that's
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
the improving
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the quality piece but also the
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
compliance in that
 
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
um when we share with you the expert
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
reviewers report
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see where we are out of
 
02:16:25.840 --> 02:16:27.830 align:start position:0%
you'll see where we are out of
compliance

02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
very good
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
are you doing with vacancy rates we like
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
to know about those too
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
yes we currently i believe um
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
we have four positions that are vacant
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:16:52.629 --> 02:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
um we are very fortunate that we have
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
been given the green light to go ahead
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
and fill positions
 
02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
and so some of them have already
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
throughout the division have been posted
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
um and will be posted within the coming
 
02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:05.030 align:start position:0%
um and will be posted within the coming
weeks

02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
um and again that just takes the you
 
02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
know that time so we had this period of
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
time where we didn't
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
have enough staff to take on all of the
 
02:17:13.359 --> 02:17:14.469 align:start position:0%
have enough staff to take on all of the
challenges

02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
um but it will be a ramp up time for
 
02:17:18.549 --> 02:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
those staff to get up to
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh speed unless we do what unfortunately
 
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
has been happening a lot lately people
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
are moving within the department
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
um so then there's always a vacancy um
 
02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
left behind when someone moves into
 
02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
another position
 
02:17:35.509 --> 02:17:35.519 align:start position:0%
so it's a great opportunity for our
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
workforce because they're able to
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
see a career path does create challenges
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
when we have those
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
and then i think you'll like these
 
02:17:50.639 --> 02:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
and then i think you'll like these
benchmarks

02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
benchmarks
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
maybe they resonate a little bit more
 
02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:55.270 align:start position:0%
maybe they resonate a little bit more
than

02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
um the previous ones that we shared on
 
02:17:57.679 --> 02:17:58.469 align:start position:0%
um the previous ones that we shared on
monday

02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
monday
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
we're actually working on providing you
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
a more comprehensive response at your
 
02:18:02.639 --> 02:18:03.990 align:start position:0%
a more comprehensive response at your
request

02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i like the quality metrics it looks
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
like that's where
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
the best work is you know for example
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
the processing housing applications
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
that's a workload measure
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
you know i i is there some standard
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
of how many applications you want to
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
fulfill in a given month or something
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's where that's going
 
02:18:28.709 --> 02:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
and this slide is a long-term project
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
where we can communicate to each other
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
over the long run this isn't fix it now
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know we're having a conversation
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
about future conversations
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
and then again turning it over to karen
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
audrey if you want to stop sharing i
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
will go ahead and share my screen
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
if i had if i could do this one more
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
time during
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
the house phase then i would actually
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
all right so the first accounting unit
 
02:19:09.669 --> 02:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to start with
 
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
is the pro health new hampshire grant
 
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
which is on page
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
11 22. so
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
this is a good place for me i think to
 
02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:20.070 align:start position:0%
this is a good place for me i think to
um

02:19:20.070 --> 02:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
turn it over to representative irf as uh
 
02:19:23.439 --> 02:19:23.750 align:start position:0%
turn it over to representative irf as uh
as

02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
our vice chair to go ahead and share the
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
rest of this
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'll come back uh after i've given my
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay are you ready i don't i don't
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
mean to just dump it on you but i was
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
i like it all right um thank you
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
so much um miss fox and i'm sorry i'm
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
missing your presentation miss jackson
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be on video so i'll
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
have some late night viewing
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
so for the pro health grant 2340 is the
 
02:20:05.389 --> 02:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
accounting unit starts at the bottom of
 
02:20:05.399 --> 02:20:06.630 align:start position:0%
accounting unit starts at the bottom of
1122

02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
1122
 
02:20:13.830 --> 02:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
this is one where we've moved the
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
contracts from 102 to 74 for that
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
is accounting unit 4113 which is
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
consumer and family affairs
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
that starts at the page of 11 23 and
 
02:20:50.469 --> 02:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
goes on to 11
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
24. is this how hot just said the mobile
 
02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:54.550 align:start position:0%
24. is this how hot just said the mobile
units

02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
units
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
were i don't believe
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
where it is just remind me that where
 
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
they are so i can put them in the right
 
02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:03.750 align:start position:0%
they are so i can put them in the right
place

02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
you don't look it up right now just when
 
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
you get there we will get to it yep
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay the next accounting unit is
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 4114 which is
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
guardianship services
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
if you remember correctly there was a
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
small prioritized need here for about 30
 
02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:22.230 align:start position:0%
small prioritized need here for about 30
000

02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:21:27.349 --> 02:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
um i believe only in fiscal year 23.
 
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
so a question here that it looks
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
yes we we had to increase the contract
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
quite a bit uh
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say it was like early
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
summer late spring
 
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i think katya can speak to why um we
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm going to defer to jane if
 
02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:53.670 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm going to defer to jane if
needed

02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
but we did have to increase it because
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
the rates were increased
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
by the court system so they set the
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
rates and also
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
um as you heard from some of those
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
numbers i gave you it's a pretty low
 
02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:07.590 align:start position:0%
numbers i gave you it's a pretty low
amount

02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
amount
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
but that again we're always running
 
02:22:10.319 --> 02:22:10.790 align:start position:0%
but that again we're always running
short

02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
short
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to run short in this
 
02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
particular area because
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
as jane knows we're always trying to
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
find um
 
02:22:20.309 --> 02:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
other funds within the division to
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
transfer to this so we wanted to fully
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
fund it this time around
 
02:22:28.130 --> 02:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody
 
02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:31.110 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody
[Music]

02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
the next account county unit is 4115
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
and this you'll see that there's an
 
02:22:49.030 --> 02:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
increase in line 550 but you can see
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
that our
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
actual expenses for 2020 are far in
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
this is another area um karen and
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the group that we are often trying
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
to find money to transfer
 
02:23:06.870 --> 02:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
because we don't really have a lot of
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
control over how the expenses come in to
 
02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.270 align:start position:0%
control over how the expenses come in to
us

02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
and this is um the legal services these
 
02:23:15.429 --> 02:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
are the individuals um the
 
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys who represent individuals who
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
are under
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
an involuntary status and their
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
appointed counsel so we have attorneys
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions appears not go ahead
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
karen the next accounting unit is 4116
 
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
interim care funds it's at the top of
 
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
because we are level funding with fiscal
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
year 20
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
with what is budgeted i believe this is
 
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
i mean it's a fairly small amount but
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things we never know
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
for sure what the utilization is going
 
02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
to be so we just
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
level fund and obviously lapse or
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes transfer to those other lines
 
02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:17.190 align:start position:0%
 
short

02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.270 --> 02:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
i think we're good the next accounting
 
02:24:21.429 --> 02:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
unit is 4117 which is
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
cmh or community mental health program
 
02:24:24.399 --> 02:24:25.590 align:start position:0%
cmh or community mental health program
support

02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh this if i am correct
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
is where those additional uh
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:39.429 --> 02:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
units are teams are yes thank you as
 
02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
well as the
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
most of the 10-year mental health plan
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
is within this accounting unit
 
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
i believe i'm sorry go ahead i was going
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
to say i believe the appropriation for
 
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 was closer to fiscal year
 
02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:52.469 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 was closer to fiscal year
21.

02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
21.
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
um jane correct me if i'm wrong but i
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
think the appropriation was a little
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
closer to the
 
02:25:00.389 --> 02:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
to the 28 million and this is one of
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
those areas that there were new funding
 
02:25:03.750 --> 02:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
there was new funding and
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
covid uh and the contracting delayed our
 
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
contract those funds they see jane not
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
on your head so okay yes
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
right so those funds didn't lap so they
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
carried over into 21.
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's true you mean that's why the 21
 
02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
number is
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
so much bigger than that now that
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
that number wouldn't reflect the carry
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
forward that was the level that
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
20 was funded at as well
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
or fairly close to that
 
02:25:35.359 --> 02:25:38.870 align:start position:0%
or fairly close to that
right

02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
so the 2020 column that you're looking
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
at is actual expenses
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
and the 2021 is an uh adjusted
 
02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:46.790 align:start position:0%
and the 2021 is an uh adjusted
authorized

02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
budget so what karen was saying was the
 
02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
20 20
 
02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
actual expenses are a little bit well
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
quite a bit lower
 
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
because that was when we were trying to
 
02:25:57.030 --> 02:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
get the programs ramped up
 
02:25:59.910 --> 02:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
the budget for 2020 was actually closer
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
to the 27 million dollar number
 
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
but weren't able to spend all of the
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
funds and they
 
02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
um carried forward this accounting unit
 
02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:08.870 align:start position:0%
um carried forward this accounting unit
um

02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
and that line item has a
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
budget footnote that allows us to carry
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
the funds forward within the biennium
 
02:26:18.230 --> 02:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
this 28 million does not reflect any
 
02:26:21.750 --> 02:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
carry forward
 
02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
do you happen to rec recall that 20
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:33.910 --> 02:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh i don't but it was it would would
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
quite a bit lower because the 10-year
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
mental health plan
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
was um funded substantially in the 2021
 
02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:41.670 align:start position:0%
was um funded substantially in the 2021
budget

02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay that's what i thought so i'm just
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
wondering given that there's still a
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
pretty good bump
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
going into the next biennium as well is
 
02:26:48.399 --> 02:26:49.270 align:start position:0%
going into the next biennium as well is
that

02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
we explain how that was accounted for
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
and i just didn't hear it
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
um so it looks like it's about uh 100
 
02:26:56.560 --> 02:26:57.429 align:start position:0%
um so it looks like it's about uh 100
000

02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
000
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure exactly what the
 
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
increase is there
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
so we can provide that level of detail
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's to carry on the
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
services that are being put into place
 
02:27:09.359 --> 02:27:11.030 align:start position:0%
services that are being put into place
today

02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:27:20.070 --> 02:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's the other hand stigmas will
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 4118 which
 
02:27:28.479 --> 02:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 4118 which
is

02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
and that is a pretty good jump in
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:27:47.349 --> 02:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
it looks like uh jane and peer support
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
that were no longer budgeting the
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
federal funds was this dish
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
dish p yes so this these federal funds
 
02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
were related to the waiver that ended
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
um on twelve thirty one twenty so
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's what that's why that got added
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
into general funds yes what i would
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
share with you and it
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's a little confusing to understand so
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
we could have a separate conversation
 
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
if you want to um but these expenditures
 
02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
were happening prior to that waiver
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
and when that waiver was put in place
 
02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:18.070 align:start position:0%
and when that waiver was put in place
these

02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
um these expenditures then got a federal
 
02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:22.469 align:start position:0%
um these expenditures then got a federal
match

02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
match
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
and the general funds that were budgeted
 
02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
here were then moved
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
to essentially support the idn project
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
so the net impact of the department for
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
the idn
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
project was essentially zero
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
so now that that waiver has ended and we
 
02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
no longer have contracts with the idn's
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
those general funds are essentially
 
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
moved back to here so
 
02:28:47.429 --> 02:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
across the budget it's in that zero but
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
it shows as an
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
increase here when we get to the
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
medicaid division and you see that the
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
idn account is no longer budgeted you'll
 
02:28:54.399 --> 02:28:55.190 align:start position:0%
idn account is no longer budgeted you'll
see

02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
several million dollars of general funds
 
02:28:58.469 --> 02:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
there that are not
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
being brought forward thank you i was
 
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually i've already seen the id and
 
02:29:02.950 --> 02:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
account and i was wondering where all
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
those funds went
 
02:29:05.349 --> 02:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
so there's most of them are still in
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
that same account just moved over to
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
the the i the funds that you would have
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
seen in that idn
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that are no longer there
 
02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
have moved back across the department
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
most of them are
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
in behavioral health but there's a small
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
amount that was in public health
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh were there any long-term supports and
 
02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:24.550 align:start position:0%
uh were there any long-term supports and
services

02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
jane no i don't think so i think it was
 
02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
mostly behavioral health
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
and they would be going to general funds
 
02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
in those other accounts is that what
 
02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:33.750 align:start position:0%
in those other accounts is that what
you're

02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes yes so those general funds that were
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
in the id and account are now sort of
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
back across the department okay is it
 
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
possible for you to um
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
generally list of where those all went
 
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
yes without too much trouble
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm pretty i don't know if we have
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
it easily in a spreadsheet but
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
um we can give you a general idea the
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
earnings change year to year but
 
02:29:57.270 --> 02:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
we can give you a general idea of where
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
they are okay it's a problem to worry
 
02:30:00.389 --> 02:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
about i was just i have to notice that
 
02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
ibm thing is that
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
we were so involved with that last time
 
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
yes i wonder what happened to
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of money there yep they're back
 
02:30:08.790 --> 02:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
across the department
 
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else the next accounting unit is
 
02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:16.309 align:start position:0%
anybody else the next accounting unit is
4119

02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
4119
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
there's not much of a change here just
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
level funding
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
so 4120 is the mental health block grant
 
02:30:52.389 --> 02:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
so this is um where i noted that the um
 
02:30:59.270 --> 02:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
one for substance abuse from the federal
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
government is
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
about 7.2 million and then the one for
 
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
mental health services is considerably
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
less than that
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
um we did receive in the federal budget
 
02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:09.190 align:start position:0%
um we did receive in the federal budget
um

02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
a five percent increase with it targeted
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
and specified for emergency response
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
so that will be coming forward if it
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
hasn't already in this budget
 
02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
we'll need to bring it in throughout
 
02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:23.030 align:start position:0%
we'll need to bring it in throughout
these

02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
the legislative process
 
02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
the question on the first on the
 
02:31:35.830 --> 02:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
previous page
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
yes at two million dollars under grants
 
02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
for public assistance and relief
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
that was that's something new put in
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
there what what does that money go for
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's actually being moved from class
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
line 102. that's the
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
um change that i've talked about where
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
we're moving
 
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
where we're budgeting those to better
 
02:31:55.990 --> 02:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
account for the single
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
audit so that it was previously on 102
 
02:32:03.270 --> 02:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's now down to 170 000
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
and now they're they're on class line
 
02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:06.550 align:start position:0%
and now they're they're on class line
74.

02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
74.
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
and the last accounting unit is 4121
 
02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:26.469 --> 02:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
what agency is that i'm always curious
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
about where these agency funds come from
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
oh give me one minute sorry
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
don't worry about it i thought you might
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
not top your head okay
 
02:32:37.910 --> 02:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just always curious when i see these
 
02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
how these funds flow around where they
 
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
flow from into
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
oh that's actually from um eagle
 
02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:45.429 align:start position:0%
oh that's actually from um eagle
technologies

02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
well that's right this
 
02:32:51.910 --> 02:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
katy do you want to take the first stab
 
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
at explaining that one no it's okay you
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't need it
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's a little confusing it took me some
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
time to understand exactly
 
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
it is federal funding that comes through
 
02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
a third-party source is the way i would
 
02:33:04.080 --> 02:33:04.870 align:start position:0%
a third-party source is the way i would
just

02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
yes that's that's a nice simple way
 
02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:14.309 --> 02:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
so that um concludes
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
the accounting units for behavioral
 
02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
the accounting units for behavioral
health

02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%

02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
