my probably my specialty areas are
 
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
behavioral health and long-term care so
 
00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 align:start position:0%

with the Department 25 years next month
 
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
uh did not grow up in the department
 
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
though had a life before the department
 
00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%

got all the information the acronyms are
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
on the back page also I asked uh
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
councelor Williams if he could put
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
together a cheat sheet
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
that lets us all know who are the
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
principles in each of the subsections of
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
the department we get phone calls from
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
constituents or in my case I got a lot
 
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
of phone calls from other
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
legislators asking who do I talk to on
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
such and such uh this sheet will be
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
invaluable it will also cut down on the
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
phone calls I place to John Williams
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%

00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%

getting another packet that's especially
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
an exhortation to myself who can lose
 
00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
things while standing
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
still so that these are the
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
Bills and there will not be
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
individual groups of the bills we're
 
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
going to hear on a particular day at
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
least that's what they've told us so far
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
so keep hold of the
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
packets please use the
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
microphone I don't hear well to begin
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
with and I hear even worse when I leave
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
my hearing aids at home which is what I
 
00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:36.509 align:start position:0%
my hearing aids at home which is what I
did

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
today we need to know that we cannot
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
withdraw a bill once we've got the bill
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
in our possession it cannot be
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
withdrawn these bills were prepared last
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
summer and we went through the process
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
in September and so on and so on and in
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
some cases
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
things have changed and the sponsor
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor other sponsors of the
 
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
bill have frequently said oh if I knew
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
now what I if I knew then what I know
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
now I would not have filed this bill or
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
I certainly wouldn't have filed it in
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
this manner I've already received a few
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
phone calls from people saying I wish to
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
have my bill
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
ited we still have to have a hearing but
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's really where the Miranda warning
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
should kick in you have the right to
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
remain silent please use it in other
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
words there's no need to have testimony
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
you may do so if you wish but I ask what
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
the point is of having a whole series of
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
people testify on a bill the sponsor of
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
which wishes it to be itl so we'll we'll
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
speak about that when these matters come
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
right before
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.149 align:start position:0%
right before

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
the house rules are if you are prime
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor or co-sponsor of a
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
so so I wanted to start with a few
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
examples of what I believe um is the
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
issue if if a a teenager is watching
 
00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:57.559 align:start position:0%
their their um younger sibling with the
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
permission of their their parents and
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
it's given an epip pin
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
or um insulin for the younger sibling
 
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
watching in fact both of the the parent
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
and the kid for accepting it has
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
committed a crime in New
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if a friend has recently di if
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
a child is recently diagnosed
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
with um a condition that would lead to
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
anaphylaxis and they get uh their brand
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
new e pin and they they um show their
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
friend that they hang out with all the
 
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.710 align:start position:0%
friend that they hang out with all the
time

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
they um they hand it to them they show
 
00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:42.919 align:start position:0%
how how they they would need to use it
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
if they were
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
incapacitated the handing it to the
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
friend they've both committed a crime in
 
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.789 align:start position:0%
friend they've both committed a crime in
New

00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if a teenager let's say is
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
cleaning up the
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
streets and finds a needle on the ground
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
that is used picks it up takes it to the
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
pharmacy or police station for proper
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
disposal that child has committed a
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
crime and then let's the last example is
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
um if a kid has has a prescription
 
00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:18.630 align:start position:0%
um if a kid has has a prescription
for

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh a needle and like is at school and
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
they need to to give themselves insulin
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
and they drop the needle on the ground
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
and it's dirty and they need to dispose
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
of that and they go to the nurse to ask
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
for an addition like an extra one um and
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
the nurse has one and they called the
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
parents and got permission the this the
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
nurse is not allowed to give that to the
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
child they would need uh an additional
 
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
prescription for that
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
needle um to give to the child and
 
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
so my so I came across this in this this
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh bill or I came across this statute
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
which is um since my bill is repealing
 
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
the statute in the back um the second
 
00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:09.799 align:start position:0%
page of my testimony um that first group
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
of language where it says control and
 
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
possession of hypmic needle are like
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
instruments without a prescription of
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
minors that is what is suggested to be
 
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.510 align:start position:0%
minors that is what is suggested to be
repealed

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
um and I came across this when I was
 
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.230 align:start position:0%
um and I came across this when I was
looking

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
for um
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
information on on occupational licenses
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
because this bill this this law is in
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
the requirement uh is in the statute for
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and Pharmacists and so the
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
penalties for anyone breaking this law
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
is the same penalty as a pharmacy
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacist which is a
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for um it it doesn't give a
 
00:23:58.269 --> 00:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
class so it would be Class B which is up
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
to a $1,200 fine unless the da requests
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
that it would be um changed to a class A
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
which would be a year in prison up to a
 
00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
year in prison and a $2,000 fund and and
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
um I think that this committee and we as
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
a nation have have started to move away
 
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.510 align:start position:0%
a nation have have started to move away
from

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
um treating addiction as a criminal
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
activity and more of a mental health um
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
activity that needs to be treated by the
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
parents and the and the physician and
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
not the judicial system and so that is
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
why I am proposing that we repeal the um
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
the requirement that we put um the kids
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
into the legal system because of
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
this um and I am proposing that we study
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
and keep it would still be a crime if
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation passes for an adult to
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
give a minor
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
a a syringe or epip pin or whatever that
 
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
they don't not have a prescription
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
for however I think that you guys should
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
study that issue and whether or not it's
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
the proper penalty the proper um section
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
of law um and if there should be
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
exceptions for something like um all the
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
other Medical
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
um or drugs that are are prescribed have
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
a prescription there is an exception for
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
being able to have an authorized user
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
handle that in the um in the event that
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
they need help administering that
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
prescription to the person that it was
 
00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
prescribed to for example if your
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
parents have cancer or something like
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
that and you wanted to help um prepare
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
the medication for your
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:58.230 align:start position:0%
the medication for your
parents

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
under this under current law that would
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
not be allowed if it was in a
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
syringe um and so there was an I I would
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
like you guys to consider maybe an
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
exception for that and
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
I um there is in in some of on the
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
second page I
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
included uh the the section of Law
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
31842 and underlined the authorized
 
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
agent um section of that uh so that you
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
guys would know exactly where where I'm
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
talking about that you could copy the
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
language and put it into this stat the
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
um other part of the statute if you um
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
deem that
 
00:26:42.389 --> 00:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
necessary and so I think that in general
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
I think that we should just not be um
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
putting the kids into unnecessary legal
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
battles and um and and obviously um the
 
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
thing that I sent sent around from the
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
CDC is they believe they we've kind of
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
gone away as as a
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
health um in our view of Health away
 
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
from trying to restrict access access to
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
Needles because of the um trying to
 
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
reduce the transmission of bloodborne
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
pathogens and um so that this is some
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
information about that and what the CDC
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
recommends um is to get rid um allow for
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
the legal sell of needles without a
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
prescription is what the CD
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
recommends um but I'm happy to take any
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions for
 
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.389 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions for
representative

00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.789 align:start position:0%
 
kerk

00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
kerk
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
oh I am T thank you for the bill the
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
question I have though you say two
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
members of the house from hhsa given
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
that some of this has to do with
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties should it be be
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
member from Criminal Justice and one
 
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
from hhsa instead because we don't have
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
much uh knowledge about criminal penalty
 
00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:08.870 align:start position:0%
much uh knowledge about criminal penalty
issues

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
I I just put the the members that I
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
thought would be have an interest in
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
this so if you yes I I think that that's
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
a reasonable
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
um change to be made yeah absolutely
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um can you explain
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
on no no I'll try again better better
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
sorry no problem can you just explain to
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
me the um where you believe um this
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
establishment of the commission
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
intersects with it sounds like some
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
other like Judiciary might have some
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
input in this so I was curious ious to
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
know if you had heard input around some
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
of those issues when drafting
 
00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
this um so speaking to the um study
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
commission I recommended um a police
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
officer a school nurse a pharmacist all
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
be included um I talked to the chair of
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice and
 
00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:26.310 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice and
they

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.950 align:start position:0%
they
um

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
they did not say they had a strong
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
feeling about wanting to be included so
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
I did
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
not include them
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
so any other
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519 align:start position:0%
folsome mind plays music okay we're on
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative yoka um we talked a
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
little bit this morning already about
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
this and I was wondering would you be
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
open to working with a couple members to
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
come up with an amendment to address the
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
issues now so that rather than repealing
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
and putting it into a study committee we
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
fix those
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
exemptions uh now with a bill so it goes
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
goes into effect right away this you
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
know this session and if then we still
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
see there's another problem maybe come
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
up with something next year but at least
 
00:30:38.909 --> 00:30:38.919 align:start position:0%
we could
 
00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
address some of the quick
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
issues thank you for the question uh if
 
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
you believe that this is a s simple uh
 
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799 align:start position:0%
solution then I'm absolutely happy to
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
work with anyone I thought that it was a
 
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
complicated issue about whether or not
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
what kind of exceptions we would want to
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
make um but if there are clear
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
exceptions um for the adults um then
 
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519 align:start position:0%
obviously i' would be happy to work with
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
anyone that wants to on that um I
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
thought it was a very complicated issue
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
about whether or not we would want to um
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
allow adults to give like unrestricted
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
access to to kids kind of thing so I I
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
kind of AED on the on the side of
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
caution on that representative yella the
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
chairs of all the Committees are under
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
immense pressure from the speaker's
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
office not to have
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
commissions as one who is increasingly
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
asked to go find people for the
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
speaker's office I can tell you it is an
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult job because those
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
people who have the time to do it and
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
the ability and the inclination are less
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
than 400 believe me fewer than 400 um
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
and some of the people I've asked who
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
would have been great on this or that
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
commission have said they're already on
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
four and they don't want to be on
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
another one my suggestion and it's only
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
that is if you pulled an ad hoc group of
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
people representing numbers of the
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
categories you have in your bill and
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
pull them together as a study group and
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
did it on the fast quick you could bring
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
an amendment as the clerk has suggested
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
back to us in about four to six weeks
 
00:32:29.159 --> 00:32:30.509 align:start position:0%
back to us in about four to six weeks
that

00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
would obviate the need for a commission
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
and accomplish what a good commission
 
00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
would probably do that's just a
 
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion I hate to see this shot down
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
commission I'm not sure that was a
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
question but thank you thank you Mr
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
chair all right would you believe I
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
believe that I I believe that you would
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
believe that and um I will take that
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
under advisor and anyone that is
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
interested please get in contact with me
 
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:07.430 align:start position:0%
interested please get in contact with me
representative

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question would you be
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
willing to consider as a way of dealing
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
with your issues
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
simply uh as a beginning
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
step having a list of exemptions with
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
protection for the
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
M minor which seems to me to be your
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
major concern is not saddling a kid
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
who's pick picking trash and has a
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
needle in their possession with a
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor conviction right and that's
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
a stretch but but perhaps a list of
 
00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
exceptions for the minor without getting
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
into the larger morass of what adults
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
May provide to miners might be a first
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
step in dealing with the concerns you
 
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.789 align:start position:0%
step in dealing with the concerns you
had

00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
without um getting too deep into the
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
weeds and uh the question was actually
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to consider that I
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
question thank you any other questions
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
m would you believe uh that um instead
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
of forming a commission that the
 
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
oversight committee on Health and Human
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
Services allows ex that committee to
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
have work groups uh and that could solve
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
the problem of forming a committee uh
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
possibility I was not aware of that but
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information thank you
 
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information thank you
wasn't

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%

Services good morning chairman Pearson
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
record my name is Abby Rogers and the
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
legislative lison for the division of
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services um when we read
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
the title of um representative's Bill we
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
thought it was more relative to um
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
syringe service program so that's the
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
information that I was prepared to
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
delivered today so since that is not the
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
topic of the bill I don't really have
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
any further comments unless um you'd
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
like to hear more about um syringe
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
service programs which I don't think
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's the intent of of the
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
representative's bill today thank you so
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee and
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
chairman uh good morning my name is Joe
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
Ebert I'm a captain with the state
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
police I oversee the Investigative
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau which is our
 
00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
detectives this is uh Lieutenant bill
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
brigh and I oversee the narcotics
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
investigations unit with State l so uh
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
on the on a on the whole we don't oppose
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
the bill uh one notion that we have it
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
seems to as written repeal the current
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
statute uh prior to a study committee uh
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
that is one piece of the bill that we
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
would oppose uh I'm sure there were
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
valid reasons uh for why the bill was
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
written why it became an RSA as it
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
stands now so we would want to uh have
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
further research into that uh before we
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh repeal that so it seems to be putting
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
the cart before the horse to repeal the
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
bill then do the study I understand the
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
chair's position on commissions or the
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh the greater bodies Commission uh
 
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
position on commissions um that's that's
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh certainly Far Over My Head uh but we
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
are more than willing to participate in
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
any commission study group ad hoc group
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
or anything else uh as it relates to uh
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%

start it until it's advertised time
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
minutes does anyone have written
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
testimony on this that can be passed
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
either to everyone if you have multiple
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
copies or to the clerk if not and any
 
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.109 align:start position:0%
copies or to the clerk if not and any
pink

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
pink
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
cards on this yet to be heard Bill 1642
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
FN may come forward at this time as
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
well and I don't think you want my
 
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
written testimony because I just hly
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
wrote it in the last 50 minutes oh
 
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
sorry you don't want my written
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
testimony because it's in my chicken
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
scratches and my worst grade in all of
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
elementary school was penmanship so my
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
fate was decided at that point and you
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
took a graduate degree in bad penmanship
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
called an MD degree exctly exactly and
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
the issue is that uh Chu grassy is the
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill I had not intended
 
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
to testify but CH grassy has covid and
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
so he's not going to be here today and
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
so I was notified about 20 minutes ago
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
that we needed somebody so I volunteered
 
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you you can sit tight for
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
about yes about two minutes and so uh
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
anybody have any good jokes
 
00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:25.349 align:start position:0%
anybody have any good jokes
no

00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
where well that's the whole point when
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
in fourth grade when my worst got my
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
lowest grade in all of Elementary School
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
in penmanship I knew that I had to go
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
ahead with my plan of being a doc it was
 
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
ordained so I I don't think you want to
 
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
writing my wife can sometimes figure it
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
out I remember that time when I had to
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
read something for you that you weren't
 
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to read yes and it all went well
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
until I inadvertently looked at you and
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
said Jerry what's that word and that
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
totally gave it away although I think
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
the chair at the time was on to us uh
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
yes I think she I'm afraid the chair was
 
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
yeah we uh Mr chairman
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
no because of that issue I'm so pleased
 
00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the prescriptions today
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
are done
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
them hey Mark do you want to borrow one
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
of my hearing aids
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
sure Jerry this is my first time to be
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
in a hearing since I got him and man it
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
is nice to be able to understand what
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
the people are saying yes you've joined
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
us yes yeah make sure you clean the wax
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
guards yeah every night every night so
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
if you want to share wax I can give you
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
one of mine but I don't think you want
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
okay but no not Blood Brothers wax
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
Brothers oh yeah thank you for yeah too
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
much information Fran is
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
indicating well we're in the final
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
countdown yes and we still have to have
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
fun okay well if we have to have fun my
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
father never got us a actual dishwasher
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
because he considered me the dishwasher
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
so maybe today I'll be our Chairman's
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
hearing aid perfect just like in my home
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
in massachus so I'm not quite sure that
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
the wording is correct I think perhaps
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
our DHHS people can clarify that for us
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit better so again I was not
 
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
prepared to testify um it just happen to
 
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
know a lot about this and I I did review
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
it particularly when uh the issue came
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
up with our Greg grandson uh I can try
 
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
to take questions if you have
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
some any questions any question any
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.670 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
representative

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you chair thank you
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
I believe the underlying bill has a lot
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
of Merit and it does make a lot of sense
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
and clont we spent tremendous amount of
 
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
time and energy talking about lead
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
poisoning and so forth as a community
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
we've done tremendous amount of work in
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
this direction so it's really critically
 
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
important that this is addressed somehow
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
the questions to you is when you get
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
into testing not all testing is done at
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
the physician's office Clara we have
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
people who actually allowed to do the
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
testing um the test results could go to
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
the physician's office they go to the
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
parents and for the parents to take the
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
action the second question is we have a
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
lot of mobile parents that go between
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
communities and a lot of times between
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
states so my concern is that you could
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
have a situation where the parent or the
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
child has been tested with the parents
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
permission but that information may not
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
be readily available for those in the
 
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
school districts in New Hampshire so
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
having some sort of a database is going
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
to be critical because most of the time
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
the parent may not actually have the
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
card or retain the card so the question
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
to you I guess is how do we deal with
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
the issue of public testing versus that
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
being done to the medical provider and
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
then number two what do we do with out
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
of state residents that move into the
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
state uh certainly a good question but I
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
know there's usually not much appetite
 
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
for databases in this state uh so I I
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
doubt that's going to get a warm
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
reception um but by the same
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
token you know perhaps requiring that um
 
00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:16.559 align:start position:0%
of course even if you require that it go
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
to the primary provider a lot of people
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a primary provider so this is
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
a real problem I don't know a good way
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
around that um if somebody comes up with
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
a good idea then we can certainly bring
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
that forth as an amendment but I had not
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
thought about that thank
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
gay since uh since we really want to
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
encourage people to do the testing and
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
data collecting is Handy at schools how
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
expensive would it be to do the testing
 
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
at school since it's just a finger
 
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
stick well I think one could argue uh at
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
school or at daycare because again we
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
want to catch these kids in that first
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
year or two and in fact even more
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
troubling is many daycares will not take
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
a child either under 18 months or under
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
three years so you know it's the old
 
00:45:08.349 --> 00:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
closing the Barn Door after the horse is
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
already out so this this is a bit of a
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
problem but you're your point is correct
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
I do not know there' be certainly um um
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
consent issues as we have in a bill
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
coming up in a little bit later uh I do
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
not know how expensive these machines
 
00:45:25.549 --> 00:45:25.559 align:start position:0%
are they would be a matter of utility if
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of kids come in already with tests
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
it may not be very cost-effective to be
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
trying to do that and we'd have to be
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
somehow allotting some money to the
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
schools to do that followup
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
followup has do we have any other
 
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
program where a mobile unit goes from
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
place from place to place I will defer
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
that to DHHS because they would probably
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
answer it better than
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
I and I think they are here to testify
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
yes yes they're here to
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
um hopefully yes thank you Mr shair and
 
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um I understand
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
just how critical it is to get these um
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
children tested early and identify them
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious if it would make more
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
sense to figure out how to get better
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with the one and two-year-old
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
testing at the doctors as opposed to
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
waiting until as you said possibly 18
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
months 3 years or 6 years old if they're
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
not even going to daycare yes I think
 
00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:28.559 align:start position:0%
though the um the portions in sections
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
three and four are trying to get at that
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
as Healthcare Providers shall report on
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
a form developed accounting of all
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
children referred for blood double
 
00:46:38.349 --> 00:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
testing the results and then of course
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
the last part uh they have to tell how
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
many children in their practice so that
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
means that DHHS can look at it and say
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
you have a compliance rate that's 10%
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's abysmal I mean you know so
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
there's not an enforcement thing but it
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
would be an issue of there's nothing
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
better than the light of day showing
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
that you're not doing well um you know
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
you could even argue have the insurers
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
do it because we know that we have a lot
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
of we tracked a lot of ways for a lot of
 
00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
our metrics in terms of quality of care
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
this is a metric for quality of care but
 
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
since a lot of the kids may not be
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
insured that may not be a very good
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
thing so the idea is to for HHS or I
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
presume even licensing board to follow
 
00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:19.559 align:start position:0%
up with shoty
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
care but I I I agree with you that's why
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
I think this again I didn't write this
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
bill but I think the idea was to have
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
multiple prongs of attack um multiple
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
layers get the information from
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
providers have a backup of when they go
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
to daycare have another backup when they
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
go to school I think that was the goal
 
00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.589 align:start position:0%
go to school I think that was the goal
of

00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
it thank you sure representative
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
you representative so I just wanted to
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh clarify a couple of things I heard so
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
you said by the time you learn that
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
there is lead poisoning it's too late
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
um I my understanding though is what
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
you're really trying to do is to avoid
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
continued exposure is or is there is
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
early intervent is there an advantage to
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
early intervention or is it more a
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
question of preventing further prolonged
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
exposure or both um I am going to
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
probably defer that to I have to confess
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
I started writing this about 20 minutes
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
before I had to get in the hot seat and
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
I've forgotten if this is one where we
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
can do some keying to yeah okay good but
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
we can do some keying to try to remove
 
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.390 align:start position:0%
we can do some keying to try to remove
it

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh to get the blood level down I was
 
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
pretty sure we could but I wasn't
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
certain thank you very much professor
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
salaway and also yes to stop the
 
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
continued exposure and also people that
 
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
have one child may just possibly have
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
another one um so this is and also there
 
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
are a lot of issues about notification
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
that occur within s247 in terms of the
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
housing stock if we have uh a child who
 
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
is a high blood blood level so yes you
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
can do some things about it but you may
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
not be able to reverse all the damage
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's already occurred thank you thanks
 
00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:04.630 align:start position:0%
that's already occurred thank you thanks
representative

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:07.780 align:start position:0%
King okay can you hear me no
 
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.190 align:start position:0%
King okay can you hear me no
[Laughter]

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
yes hearing aids noar hearing aids um
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
representative for uh taking this
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
question which I think uh already covers
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
some of it and that is um you know what
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
do we
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
do this bill I think it it's great if we
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
test the kids and the question is what
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
happens when we start finding more and
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
more kids that that test positive and
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
I'm even thinking of like um you know a
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
lot of our older homes are we going to
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
be setting up programs for owners of
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
those properties to Abate their lead
 
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what sb247 did do that I
 
00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:53.559 align:start position:0%
don't remember all those details I
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to dig it up but it it
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
did create um funding to help with uh
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
loans for abatement for both uh owners
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
of rental units and I think also for
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
private individuals I think if both
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
those were included that was actually
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
one of the major thrusts of the bill was
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
not just to identify but to address the
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of the housing stock
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
because again we have the oldest housing
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
stock in the
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
nation any other questions of
 
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.430 align:start position:0%
nation any other questions of
Representative

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.950 align:start position:0%
Representative
kerk

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm sorry I didn't already
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
address you
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
before uh uh we learned on one of the
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
bills lead bills we learned that we had
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
a high source of lead in the children's
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
water coolers at school so is that being
 
00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.549 align:start position:0%
water coolers at school so is that being
worked

00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
worked
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
on that's separate and I do not
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
recall again HHS will probably because
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
this is what they do we'll probably have
 
00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
better detail about how that was
 
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
addressed but I do remember that was an
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
issue because it doesn't you have the
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
kids have exposure both uh at home and
 
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.630 align:start position:0%
kids have exposure both uh at home and
at

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
school thank
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative kerk the
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
chair calls now on Nick Norman from the
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
apartment association of New
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you Mr
 
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
Norman thank you for having me speak
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
today so I I don't have a lot of
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
testimony to prepare are prepared for
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
this but I want to bring out one point
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
and I have emailed this testimony to you
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
very early this morning so if you check
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
your email it's there over here that
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
using that technology which is the the
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
rule and law now will keep the
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
environment safe and it's reasonably
 
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
easy to accomplish using RRP technology
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
abatement so uh someone also asked about
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
testing of lead in water in schools that
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
is part of the last lead commission that
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
we we're in and there is a bill in this
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
season on testing of water and lead in
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
schools or dick airs or something like
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
that you'll see it come up and I would
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
be extremely happy to take any question
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
if people are interested in what
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
landlords think or how we weigh in on
 
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
this any questions from Mr Norman
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
represent and lead poisoning prevention
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
program is responsible for implementing
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
RSA 13A the paint poisoning prevention
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
and control law which is in place to
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
identify and to provide services to
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire who have
 
00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
elevated blood lead levels the healthy
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
homes and lead poisoning prevention
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
program oversees our state's blood lead
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
surveillance system and provides nurse
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
case management and environmental
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
investigation to families with children
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
72 months and younger that have elevated
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
blood levels I would like to thank the
 
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to speak
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
today and I want to thank the sponsors
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill for their interested in
 
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh more cases and
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
therefore uh and because the testing is
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
already reported by the Laboratories the
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
the tests would be reported to the state
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
but it would be another impetus and
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
reminder for a parent about the need for
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
recording would that
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
be okay with the
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
Department um just to make sure I
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
understood the question so I I I believe
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
what you said is would we be more
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
amendable too if the language in the
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
bill did not have the reporting
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
requirement from the daycares or the
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
schools back to the department it would
 
00:53:45.549 --> 00:53:45.559 align:start position:0%
impact certainly impact the um uh
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
Appropriations needed uh for the
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
Department to establish those secure
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
networks um and a database but there are
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
other elements in the bill that still
 
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
require the department to do certain
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
things like report back out in publicly
 
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
um reported uh uh reports there's also
 
00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:08.799 align:start position:0%
language in there about um entry into
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
child care facilities and also reporting
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
from health care providers so um
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
certainly if there's an amendment to the
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
bill the department would be happy to
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you both for taking my
 
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
questions um I understand that there is
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
this cost of implementation at the
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
department um do you think that the cost
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
of implementation at our child care
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
providers would be another burden that
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
might hurt our expansion of child care
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
options and do you think the cost of
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
implementation at the schools would be
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.069 align:start position:0%
 
mandate

00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:55.990 align:start position:0%
mandate
um

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
I can't speak uh directly but I my
 
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it does create a
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
burden for the child care sector and the
 
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
well representative gay thank you thank
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
questions which is it's kind of like a
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
double barrel question what would be
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
your favorite thing to do that you think
 
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
would address the
 
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
address this issue um and what would you
 
00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
think about my idea is that it's it's
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
better to do a full press trying to get
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
people aware of the problem just like
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
tobacco was attacked you know there was
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
a full press effort it was a cultural
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
thing uh so that and so I'm I'm feeling
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
torn between we have to prevent so we
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
really need to encourage people people
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
to remove the lead but then we ought to
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
be testing so that people who find out
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh my ground is you know it's
 
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
not just the walls and the doors but I
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
have to be careful about outside too so
 
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm all for the testing and all I can
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
think is that when I was a little kid
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
about a hundred years ago we went and
 
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
got our shots we all knew about the
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
shots and we all went down to the center
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
in town there was a public health center
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
and got them there and so it's kind of
 
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
like educate people the parents take
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
them and you have well in those days we
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have mobile units of anything but
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
if we had a mobile unit that could go
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
from down to town and here's your here's
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
your date we're going to be here these
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
two days I'm envisioning that being the
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
most coste effective way to do
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
testing uh but if please respond to that
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
question sorry I'll
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
stop sure I'll try so I mean this I I
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
think you're right that it is a a a
 
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
two-part approach to intervention you
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
have your prevention which is your
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
primary source of prevent you know let's
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
let's get the lead out um and and also
 
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh to educate and to test and to treat
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
if necessary so if kids have elevated
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
blood levels you want to you want to
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
find out about that early on and you
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
want to treat and and and remove those
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
um Hazard exposures so and as Beverly
 
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
alluded to before um the state has uh
 
00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:33.559 align:start position:0%
processes in place uh to encourage or
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
increase testing rates in New Hampshire
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the pandemic has created a
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
a little blip if you will we were seeing
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
increased rates of uh you know lead lead
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
testing occurring but I I do believe the
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic has impacted that and and
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's actually uh something that's been
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
seen nationally that's not just a New
 
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire situation is that kids aren't
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
getting to their provider offices soon
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
enough um be due to the pandemic issues
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
so we're hoping that we our our work
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
will continue forward and we'll still
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
see that once we get beyond the pandemic
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
that we'll see those lead testing rates
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
continue to in increase because that's
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's our what our focus is and our
 
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
work is at the department thank you very
 
00:58:23.029 --> 00:58:23.039 align:start position:0%
much I just want to remind those who
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
have been using the amendment word
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
that this is an early Bill and has to
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
vacate this committee uh before the
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
first half of February so if you any of
 
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
you wish to work on amendments on this
 
00:58:39.029 --> 00:58:39.039 align:start position:0%
with anybody else uh that's the deadline
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
so yes representative Weber thank you
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%

00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
that this would go to finance as a
 
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
second committee yes it is thank you and
 
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%

with that we close the hearing on House

00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
about something uh
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
well no oh sorry I wanted to just I know
 
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
what you wanted to do no no no sorry no
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
no that's you don't know I don't no well
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
I'm still going to say no but thank you
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
that's fine all right opening up now the
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1334 relative to
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
the definition of
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
vaccination I received an email from
 
00:59:31.839 --> 00:59:33.750 align:start position:0%
vaccination I received an email from
representative

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
coma who said she will not be present
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
today and also recommends now we itl
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
this bill we still have to have a
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
hearing and I really truly hope no one
 
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
speaks to this because the sponsors
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
already said itl the bill and we know
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
that this happens because we're remember
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
we put all these things together last
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
summer turned them in they became bills
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
times changed we've learned new things
 
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
so it's no disgrace whatever for a
 
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor and we cannot withdraw the bill
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
but we can itl it which is what she
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
request are there any pink cards on this
 
01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
no nothing is there anyone who wishes to
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
speak no
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%

over now I open the hearing on rep on
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 1244 local relative to parental
 
01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
consent to medical and dental treatments
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
of children in schools and we call on
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
our very own representative kushman to
 
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
bills thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
committee I bring to you today HB
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
1244 this bill seeks to insert in
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
statute a requirement That explicit
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
written consent from a child's parent or
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
Guardian be given in order for the child
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
to receive medical or dental treatments
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
in schools while DHHS does have guidance
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
that states two patient identifiers
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
should be checked and that a consent
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
form should be signed before a child can
 
01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
participate in covid-19 vaccination
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
clinics it is only
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
guidance does the DHHS guidance document
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
carry the weight of law uh what are the
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
penalties for deviating from this
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
Guidance the word guidance implies that
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
that these are not rules but guidelines
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
and theoretically a school could adopt a
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
policy of opt out or implied
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
consent the World Health Organization
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
defines implied consent as follows a
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
process by which parents are informed of
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
imminent vaccination through social
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
mobilization and communication
 
01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
communication sometimes including
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
letters directly addressed to the
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
parents subsequently the physical
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
presence of the child or adolescent with
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
or without an accompanying parent at the
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
vaccination session is considered to
 
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.950 align:start position:0%
vaccination session is considered to
imply

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
imply
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
consent this practice is based on the
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
opt out principle and parents who do not
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
consent to vaccination are expected
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
implicitly to take steps to ensure that
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
their child or adolescent does not
 
01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
participate in the vaccination session
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
this may include not letting the child
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
or adolescent attend school on a
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination day if vaccine delivery
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
occurs through schools so the World
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
Health Organization actually used this
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
consent process in randomized cluster
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
trials for a malaria vaccine um on
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
720,000 children in Africa and actually
 
01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
in all of its um expanded program on
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
immunization trials it uses that um opt
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
out consent process um and it has
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
received significant backlash for that
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
um there were some articles in the
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
British medical journal um some going
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
back and forth so in New Hampshire the
 
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:22.839 align:start position:0%
optout standard that the wh uses in its
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
vaccine research won do we need to
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that no family's rights are
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
violated and no child receives any
 
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
medical or dental treatments for which
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
their parents have not given Express
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
consent we must ensure that um there are
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
no opt out consent processes being used
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
here and it needs to be in statute not
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
only in guidelines um it's a simple
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
Common Sense bill for our state and I
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again and members
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee and I ask you to
 
01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:53.799 align:start position:0%
support this and give it an OTP thank
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions for
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
representative kushman from the
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
you for um uh bringing the bill and
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question because I hadn't any
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
idea that wasn't already in statute um
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
my question is and it may be for you or
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
it may be from somebody from DHHS so I'm
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
putting it out there for
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
everybody if the intent as it appears to
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
be is to
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
require um participa consent for all
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
participation in medical and dental
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
procedures that might happen at a school
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh is bury kind of burying it in the
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
children's oral health initiative the
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
right place to give
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
everybody notice that this is a
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
requirement not simply for oral health
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
programs but for any
 
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
program and the corollary to that is if
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
we were to find a
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
more um Global placement for the
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
provision uh would you want to put in an
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
exception for emergency care which
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be an exception at the
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
moment but certainly if if a child is in
 
01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.630 align:start position:0%
moment but certainly if if a child is in
extreme

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
distress the the usual procedure is to
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
treat first and and make the child safe
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
afterwards um thank you for your
 
01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
question I don't believe that the
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
department administers any
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
emergency treatment per se I mean School
 
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
nurses maybe to stabilize a child sure
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
before an ambulance gets there um but
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
the way I read it it it's it's programs
 
01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
administered by the department and and
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
section one is outside of the children's
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
oral health initiative um
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
statute so I think that addresses the
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
first question that you had okay um but
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean if we need to dig in and
 
01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
just see if it's in the right place in
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
statute we can look at it closer um but
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
I will defer to DHHS on on the emergency
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
treatment if there's any conflict with
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
that representative I read in line five
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
medical or dental mhm but then I read in
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
916 bold italics a change oral health
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
only correct I'm I'm help me on this
 
01:09:35.789 --> 01:09:35.799 align:start position:0%
because I see a disconnect so it's two
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
different sections in statute so they
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay um the first one
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
is um I'd have to look at the root
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
statute for that one 126a it has to do
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
with schools in general okay um and then
 
01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
the bottom one is the oral health
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
initiative that's why it only refers to
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
Dental in that paragraph should I infer
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
then from line five that medical or
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
dental treatment is all already requires
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
explicit consent because it's not in
 
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
section okay they don't yeah they I get
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
it now thank you everybody
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
any qu any further questions for
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative Leo um
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh when you when you
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
looked at the Statue and looked at this
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
um it appears to me that you're talking
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
about programs administered by the
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
department which seems distinct from the
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
nursing programs that are administered
 
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
by the school and the SAU I know I dealt
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
with School nurses quite a bit on my
 
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
previous committee um is that something
 
01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
where where you have the belief that
 
01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
these programs administered by the
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
department are distinct from from those
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
care yes that was my
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
impression um the vaccine clinics are
 
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
and the the oral health initiative
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
clinics they're under
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
you representative gay thank you for
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question is there any way uh I
 
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
guess this is followup to the other
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative's question about making
 
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
this more global is there any way uh do
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
you have a problem with mentioning it in
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
multiple places in the rsas rather than
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
just one place uh and this seems like a
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
really good place to start uh but again
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm questioning on line four do we
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
have to just
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
say uh refer to DHHS rules because I
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't care what rules are I would want
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
medical or dental care in a school to
 
01:11:58.990 --> 01:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
require uh author you know a parental
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
approval so should we put a an extra
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
phrase in
 
01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
there on line four thank you for your
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
question Global yeah I I totally would
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
not be against doing that just to make
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
sure it applies to any programs admin
 
01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
administered to school that is the you
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
know the purpose of the bill any any
 
01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
medical or dental treatments besides
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
emergency um that there would need to be
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
explicit consent before those can be
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
administered follow up follow up would
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
it change would would we meet that
 
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
without adding a whole bunch of words
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
simply by changing the word on line four
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
instead of administered by the
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
school yeah I think just by getting yeah
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
Crossing out by the department any
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
program that provides metal medical or
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
dental treatment in a school setting
 
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
yeah shall require
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
y I saw representative Merchants hand
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
first and then representative
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and also
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank representative for taking my
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
question I noticed in the line
 
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
16 it says any
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
school however if you go back to line
 
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
five it says a school so we talk about
 
01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
all schools like we're doing in line 16
 
01:13:29.229 --> 01:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
private um yes it would be I mean that's
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
the intention I don't see too much
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
conflict with that there when if it was
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
applied but so would you be comfortable
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
by inserting the board any yeah in line
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
five thank you yes thank
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
Shiro thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
online 9 five it refers to medical or
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
dental treatment I know in my community
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
um we have um Dental screenings for
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
students in school
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that would be
 
01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
considered treatment although it often
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
leads to referrals to treatment um would
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
this consent um be
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
needed based on your bill to have those
 
01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.229 align:start position:0%
needed based on your bill to have those
Dental

01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
Dental
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
screenings thank you for your question
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
and or Vision screen for that matter
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you or scoliosis screenings you
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
rais a really good point um and I and
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you brought it up um I don't
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
think that it would and there have been
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
scenarios where an optin um to an opin
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
process for screenings have resulted in
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and so in the interest of
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
protecting the kids and the parents and
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
the schools it would probably be good to
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative

01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative Judy Aaron who wishes to
 
01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:09.570 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:09.570 --> 01:15:13.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair good morning Mr
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
chair and good morning committee um I'm
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
here today to support this bill and I
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
really really appreciate how you're word
 
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
crafting this this is wonderful that
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
that you are all working together to
 
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
really uh make this
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
bill do what it's supposed to
 
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
do it's a pretty basic Bill and a pretty
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
clear that no medical procedures or
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
medical treatment or medical screening
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
now that you've brought that point up
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
should be done to any child without a um
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
explicit uh cons sent from the parent or
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
legal guardian that's the way it should
 
01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.990 align:start position:0%
legal guardian that's the way it should
be

01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
and I believe
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
that every single one of us here whose
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
parent who has had a child in school
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
would be mortified if something uh was
 
01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
done to our child in school uh regarding
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
their medical treatment without our
 
01:16:19.629 --> 01:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
knowledge we are the ones ultimately who
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
care for these children our children
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
and if something goes wrong uh as a
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
result of the treatment that's given in
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
school without our consent we are the
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
ones that have to deal with it and take
 
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
care of
 
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
it and that's something very very
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
important we have to keep in mind yes we
 
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
want to keep our children healthy and in
 
01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
school it's a good place to see where
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know everybody is
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
congregated there already it maybe made
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
makes it easy uh certain screening
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
appointments Health appointments
 
01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.750 align:start position:0%
appointments Health appointments
whatever

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
it it can be done there in
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
schools that's a
 
01:17:02.629 --> 01:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
convenience um but by the same token
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
parents should be made aware and be
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
given um they not be given but they they
 
01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
have the right to uh opt their have
 
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
their child you know give consent to
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
what happens to their child during the
 
01:17:21.149 --> 01:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
school day so with that I I really
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate all of you working together
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
to get this kind of language into
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
statute it's very important and I
 
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time to do this thank
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
you any questions for representative
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
Aaron representative kerk yes thank you
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I wanted to
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
reflect back onto that question of
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
screening because the comment you used
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
is doing something to our kids and the
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
risk involved and I appreciate that in
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
terms of actually providing a treatment
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
but a screening is uh I can't think of
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
anything the screenings that we do such
 
01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
as Vision or scoliosis screening or
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
hearing screening that has any risk and
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
we're not doing something to the child
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
so I wonder why we would want to
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh the screening without
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
permission well perhaps parent might not
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
want their child screened for
 
01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
certain procedures or you know certain
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
health issues for whatever reason
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know you can ask it would
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
be up to the parent I would imagine to
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh to decide whether they want their
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
not thank
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron representative
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman and also
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank representative Pi the question
 
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
um this really deals with routine but it
 
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that explicitly my concern
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
is if a school nurse needs to treat a
 
01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
patient in an emergency without the
 
01:18:58.990 --> 01:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
consent they have to use an EpiPen
 
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
because of a penut allergy and so forth
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
is that going to preclude the nurse from
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
doing that or do we call the parent
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
first to get permission and wait for the
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
child I would imagine that the parent
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
already has something in
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
writing in with regard to allergies in
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
in the schools that that that wouldn't
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
come up as a problem followup please
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
follow up um yes it may be noted in the
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
chart of the child the allergy however
 
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
the consent for treatment may not be
 
01:19:33.149 --> 01:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
there I don't know that that would be an
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
issue that would come up if if if my
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
child has an allergy of some sort and I
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
leave an EpiPen with the school
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
nurse without I'm I'm sure that there's
 
01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
going to be some sort of consent along
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
with it to use it if in an
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
emergency my suggestion is as the
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
amendment is being crafted these various
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh suggestions will be taken to mind and
 
01:19:58.510 --> 01:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
heart but thank you for raising them
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
list representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative um
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure have you seen um some of
 
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
the news articles about some genital
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
screening of girls where one of the
 
01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
school nurses actually did invasive
 
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
screenings for them and their parents
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
were not
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
notified I have and it's uh pretty
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
pretty horrifying that a parent would
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
not be aware of that kind of screening
 
01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:28.229 align:start position:0%
not be aware of that kind of screening
going

01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:30.040 align:start position:0%

actually okay but anyways for the record
 
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
representative Al baldau Rockingham
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
County District live which is uh
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
London um when I read the email that uh
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative kushman put out I was
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
kind of surprised that because i' saying
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
I'm a father of seven children four step
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
kids 13 grandkids and I always thought
 
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
it was already in school I didn't know
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
it was just a rule because I was one who
 
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
pushed for many years and my kids gone
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
to schools all around the country but
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunate out of uh five or six kids
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
gone here in New Hampshire uh five of
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
degrees uh M Bachelors you know when two
 
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
have Masters one went in the Marines so
 
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire schools have done well for
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
my children but we've gone to schools
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
all around the country and we made damn
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
well sure parental notification was
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
involved in anything my kids went to
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
school for an education they didn't go
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
there for a physical by nurses or
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
genital checks or anything like that
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
that's none of their damn business
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
business that's the parents business
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
I've written uh one of my sons had
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
headaches and here and there and I have
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
written letters just to give them
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
aspirin to nurse so any type of
 
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
screening um whether it be Dental or
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
anything should have parental permission
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
now you talk about emergencies what to
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
do there's no doubt in my mind parents
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
here whether it be epid needles or
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
aspirins or any type of you know um
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
Psychopathic drugs that they're required
 
01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
to take during the day or there's
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
there's letters you're required to
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
submit a letter so there should be no
 
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
difference here and I'm speaking as a
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
father you know and have grandkids in
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
the school systems here that if you're
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
going to put in for emergency Define
 
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:43.639 align:start position:0%
what an emergency
 
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
is okay because otherwise that word will
 
01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.110 align:start position:0%
is okay because otherwise that word will
be

01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
abused right uh we send our kids for an
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
education not for a physical and I thank
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
you and that's all I have and that's why
 
01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
I was pretty motivated that uh
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
representative kushman put this bill in
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
because it's a no-brainer it's a fixed
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
something that should have been put in
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
law a long time ago and I thank you
 
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.560 align:start position:0%

bill um I love I want to uh Echo what
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
rep Aaron said about the way that you're
 
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
word crafting it I know from experience
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
how difficult it is to make it concise
 
01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
so that there's no misunderstandings and
 
01:24:23.629 --> 01:24:23.639 align:start position:0%
we don't have to redo and do and redo so
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that um I really want to
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
say that when I was school nursing and
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
my entire nursing career the most
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
important thing for us as healthc Care
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
Professionals is to follow the law
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
respect parents protect children's
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
rights and um this bill I also Echo rap
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
baldasaro that this should have been in
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
place a long time
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
ago we as nurses should not be doing
 
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
anything that a parent is unaware of so
 
01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
when I did um hearing tests vision
 
01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
screening scoliosis testing we number
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
one sent out notices that the child
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
needs to wear a bathing suit top so that
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
we could do scoliosis treatment um
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
screening excuse me we wanted them to
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
know we were doing Vision because they
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
needed their glasses if they came
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
without their glasses I couldn't test
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
their vision and for hearing if they had
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
just had a
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
cold or have a cold I can't do their
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
hearing because they can't hear when
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
they have fluid in their station too so
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
there's School nurses are overworked you
 
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
know that underpaid I used to call it
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
volunteer work because I made $11 an
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
hour but it was I loved that work so I
 
01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:53.719 align:start position:0%
really didn't care yeah I I love
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
volunteering so
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
um paperwork is a pain in the neck what
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
we would do in schools even through my
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
high school um teaching is we would have
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
a list of permission forms at the
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
beginning of a school year these are the
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
movies we show in the classroom this is
 
01:26:14.109 --> 01:26:14.119 align:start position:0%
what the school nurse does throughout
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
the year you'll be told a week in
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
advance that this needs to be done so
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
that preparation can be made so one of
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
my inner School inner city schools had a
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
health clinic incorporated into the
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
building because we had underserved
 
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
children extremely underserved children
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
and parents had trouble getting
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
transportation to go to the primary or
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
to the dentist so we welcomed certain
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
things um at that time it was we made
 
01:26:48.109 --> 01:26:48.119 align:start position:0%
sure they had breakfast and
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
lunch sometimes we made sure they had
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
dinner um
 
01:26:53.639 --> 01:26:56.910 align:start position:0%
dinner um
but

01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make
 
01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.510 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make
sure

01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
that I want to F finish my thought with
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
we only did Dental we had the manest
 
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
Health Department dental hygienists come
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
in and with prior
 
01:27:15.149 --> 01:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
notice um they would set up in the
 
01:27:18.109 --> 01:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
atrium their equipment and the children
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
were all prepped and they got sunglasses
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
and fun things and we determined who
 
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
might need a referral who might have an
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
absess who can't concentrate in the
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
classroom so parents should I'll make it
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
shorter parents should be aware of
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
what's happening in your schools and
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
that it should be written um consent can
 
01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of it can be done at the beginning
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
of the year and um it's important for
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
parents to protect their kids and to
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
teach them and teachers and nurses that
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
this is a minimal requirement the
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
parents know what's happening with their
 
01:27:59.229 --> 01:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
kids I would entertain any questions any
 
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
camarada seeing none thank you so much
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
volunteering and the final pink card I
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
have is from rusen Chester from

herself we're getting a bit of feedback
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me would you hang on for one
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
second because we want to hear you but
 
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
other microphones are on and that's
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
system you may now proceed thank you
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
russan it's spelled r USU SS
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
an um russan Chester Bedford New
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm a former uh State of New
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employee and uh I've worked
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
with many um children school systems um
 
01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.310 align:start position:0%
with many um children school systems um
and

01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
um disabled adults and um the one thing
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
that I can speak to is that I too was
 
01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
surprised This was um already not in
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
place when I worked for the State of New
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm pretty sure that we fought
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
Services actually fought to put
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
something like this in place
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
specifically because we had a child who
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
um was um
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
significantly easily
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
overstimulated and some of the
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
screenings were problematic the parent
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
was not notified um prior to the
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
screening and then the parent had to
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
deal with the Fallout so that alone
 
01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
should tell us even something as simple
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
as screening needs to be a parental
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
consent how the schools most of the
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
schools now if you need to bring an
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
EpiPen to school or um if you want your
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
child to be able to have Tylenol if they
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
if they say they they they have a
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
headache or something like that there is
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
something that the school can do at the
 
01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year with whatever
 
01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
they're bringing in to say I'm giving
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
parental consent that allows the nurse
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
um or anyone else in the school to not
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
have to go and check because it's with
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
the it's it's already there do I have
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
parental consent to to work with this
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
this child um so I'm coming from a
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
little bit different point I did want to
 
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
talk to two things regarding treatment
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
and screening no risk I spoke a little
 
01:30:38.109 --> 01:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
bit about how screening can be risk um
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
maybe not in in all cases physically but
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
um emotionally and
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
psychosocial um so that's important and
 
01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
um routine uh I actually spoke with that
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
spoke to that too is that it may be in
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
the child's chart but it's but the
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
consent may not be there the schools if
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
they are have anything for any child
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
that consent for that specific thing has
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
to be with the item um and um it this
 
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh the schools to have less liability
 
01:31:16.159 --> 01:31:17.830 align:start position:0%
uh the schools to have less liability
over

01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:31:21.149 --> 01:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
um having treating children because the
 
01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
consent would already be there or not be
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
there it also would allow parents not to
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
feel like they shouldn't send their
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
child to school on any given day because
 
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
they heard that they're going to be
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
doing the screening today so that's mine
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
question I know I was the
 
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
person thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I know I was the
 
01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:53.719 align:start position:0%
representative that brought up the
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
question of screening
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
um however I'm struggling with the idea
 
01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
of needing consent for screenings and
 
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
you use the example of someone who was
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
um easily overstimulated and had some
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
kind of screening and that led to um
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
problems but how would that be different
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
than um asking a student to participate
 
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
in anything in school um asking them to
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
do do
 
01:32:26.189 --> 01:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
their um math work or something else um
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
a child who could be easily
 
01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.629 align:start position:0%
a child who could be easily
overstimulated

01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
overstimulated
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
by a screening could be easily
 
01:32:37.950 --> 01:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
overstimulated by any request of a a
 
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
school staff and that is um why we have
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
Professionals in
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
school so I I guess my question is how
 
01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
would you distinguish between a
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
screening and other requests of
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
students so with with regards to
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
overstimulation and during the Academia
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
portion of a child's um education that's
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
what the 504s and the IEPs are in place
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
for bottom line um we don't have that
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
for our administrative folks or our
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
nurses we don't have that kind of thing
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
well a little bit with the
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
administrative folks but with the nurses
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
specifically with regards to medical
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
dental vision all that type of thing we
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
currently don't have that kind of
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
protection in place for for those um
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
people within our school system they're
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
aware of the 504 they're aware of the
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
IEP it doesn't necessarily mean that
 
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
they know that uh scoliosis screening is
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
going to send that kid right off the
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
charts because of uh past history of um
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
something that the school was not aware
 
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:47.080 align:start position:0%

name is John Williams I'm the director

of legislative affairs for the
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and services and
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
I'm privileged to have attorney Rob
 
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
Barry who is General Counsel Rob Barry
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's I thought I was projecting well um
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
attorney Rob Barry who is General
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
Counsel and also legislatively aison for
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
our division of Medicaid services um the
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
insightful commentary the reason why we
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
felt the need to putting in the pink
 
01:34:33.149 --> 01:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
card was to at least offer some
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
assistance and agreement in thanks to uh
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative gay represent Leon and
 
01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
also represent Weber uh uh as to their
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
insightful observations that this bill
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't just touch upon Medicaid but
 
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
rather I think there's a larger
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
population that the bill sponsor would
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
like to capture under this bill um so
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
our suggestion we are here as a resource
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
to you um uh and also I would make
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
mention that this bill actually would
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
either be in co- jurisdiction with the
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education or perhaps even
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
more prominently with the Department of
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
Education versus the Department of
 
01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
Health and services so attorney Barry
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
caught one potential scrier error uh
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
that you'll find on line two of the bill
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
and it makes a reference to inserting a
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
new paragraph after
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
Roman 16 l case a Roman 16 lower case a
 
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
a quick review of the rsas shows that
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
there is no RSA uh that is uh 16a so you
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
would need to just re reumer that to
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
being uh Roman 16 which is repealed but
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
by the way that the drafting Attorneys
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
at the office of legislative Services
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
would handle it they would have then the
 
01:35:45.629 --> 01:35:45.639 align:start position:0%
new paragraph being uh 16 lowercase a if
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to anybody but
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
represent Weber and myself and
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
so uh next uh at the very bottom where
 
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh and this is really kind of the whole
 
01:35:57.790 --> 01:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
purpose I believe from repr kushman
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
embedded in the next section uh relative
 
01:36:03.149 --> 01:36:03.159 align:start position:0%
to the Bold italic language relative to
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
parental consent written parental
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
consent um if you are to look at the
 
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education statutes and
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
find an appropriate location within that
 
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps what you could do is take this
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
language and cross reference it back to
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education statute
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
making it very clear that the universe
 
01:36:20.189 --> 01:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at is not just
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
restricted to those under the Medicaid
 
01:36:23.950 --> 01:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
Program and so with that I offer
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
ourselves as a resource resource to you
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
on at least a procedural pieces of this
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions clinically Dr
 
01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
Sarah finny who is our Dental Medicaid
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
director um Dr Finny was not coming here
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
today because the goal here today was
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
looking at specifically the issues not
 
01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
clinical but rather the issue around
 
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
parental consent and we felt that
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
attorney Barry and perhaps myself could
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
help assist the committee in in drafting
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
in that respect but if there are
 
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
clinical questions for the Department
 
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
certainly she is available uh to having
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
a conversation with this committee
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
finally uh attorney Diana Fenton and
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's Fen t n Feen T and I see head
 
01:37:03.149 --> 01:37:03.159 align:start position:0%
shaking yes she is essentially my
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
counterpart with the Department of
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
Education she did give her regrets of
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
not being here today and she actually
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
contacted our agency to ask if we would
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
at least report back to her on any
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
requests from from this committee so we
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
will make her aware that uh this
 
01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
committee would be reaching out to her
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
potentially for an amendment to this
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to make sure that it is in
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
the appropriate location within the
 
01:37:26.669 --> 01:37:26.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Education statutes and
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
with that that's probably the briefest
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
testimony for those of you who know me
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
and for those you who don't know me that
 
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
was a concise testimony on my part thank
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
do and we will take any questions but I
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
can see we're probably good to go thank
 
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much and since there
 
01:37:49.589 --> 01:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
are no more pink cards and no hands up I
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
now close the hearing on House Bill
 
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
1244 local and we will be looking
 
01:37:58.510 --> 01:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
forward to a wonderful Amendment coming
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
to us so we can exec the bill I open now
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill
 
01:38:08.350 --> 01:38:08.360 align:start position:0%

01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs and relative to
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%

sorry I'm here today to speak about
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
1466 I did write a little blurb
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
up I apologize about my voice as well I
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
weekend a physician's practice and
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
choices for prescribing is based in
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
science and knowledge as patients we
 
01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
trust their clinical judgment and that
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
they follow a code of medical
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
ethics what is prescribed should be
 
01:39:02.189 --> 01:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
between the prescriber and patient not
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist government Etc many
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
medications have been used for off label
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
use and will continue to be used when a
 
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
medication is used off label it means
 
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
that the medication has been FDA
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
approved for safety but not necessarily
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
for what it was originally intended
 
01:39:21.149 --> 01:39:21.159 align:start position:0%
for um there are also many medications
 
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
that are used safely in other countries
 
01:39:24.589 --> 01:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
that we do not have access to here in
 
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
ours and we should not change that now
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
due to certain things being
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
politicized a few examples are Calis and
 
01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
Viagra it was originally used for
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
circulation uh Topamax
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
was um for seizures but it's now used
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
for headaches and sometimes an appetite
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
just had a question about the language
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
on line 14 of the bill where it says no
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
licensed pharmacist shall face
 
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary or disciplinary action
 
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
for ing a valid prescription for off
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
wondering it's it's also the
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary action is also referred
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
to on line seven and I'm wondering what
 
01:40:42.589 --> 01:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
is um I believe it's
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
just being spoken to
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
by the company
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
or you know whoever is in charge of them
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%

Etc representative kerk thank you very

01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
question about whether you would be
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
amendable to what I think would be a
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
friendly Amendment for
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
clarification in line uh line six and
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
sorry five and six you comment about uh
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
use off label when it's based upon sound
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence or sound medical
 
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
opinion agree with that below you have
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
these exemptions uh exceptions I should
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
say that there be no disciplinary action
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
unless the manufacturer specified the
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
hazard for that use or the license he
 
01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
misled would you be amendable to adding
 
01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
your language above and adding as a
 
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
third condition where a person can still
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
be disciplined being that if sound
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence and sound medical
 
01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
opinion did not support this specific
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
off laal use by that license in other
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
words just reflecting your language
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
because you're do give that as a
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
qualifier for what makes sense why do we
 
01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
why would we not have that down below as
 
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
something that would be an
 
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
exception yeah we will look into that
 
01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.510 align:start position:0%
exception yeah we will look into that
thank

01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%

you representa for taking my question a
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Weber's
 
01:42:29.589 --> 01:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
question um would you be comfortable
 
01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
putting the
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
word on line
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
15 action by the Board of
 
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy versus I think once we get into
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
the employer employee relationship
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.910 --> 01:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
I know that Family Practice providers
 
01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719 align:start position:0%
may not prescribe certain medicines
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
without a special
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
license would this bill remove
 
01:43:05.199 --> 01:43:08.470 align:start position:0%
license would this bill remove
that

01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
Solway would you speak into the
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
microphone please for the
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
elderly sorry Mr chairman I'm a little
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
hard of hearing
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
what um uh representative kerk has
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned the wording on lines five and
 
01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
six uh when such use is based upon sound
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence or sound medical
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
opinion it are is there an assumption
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
FDA bases its decisions on something
 
01:43:50.669 --> 01:43:50.679 align:start position:0%
other than sound scientific evidence
 
01:43:52.770 --> 01:43:52.780 align:start position:0%
evidence or sound medical
 
01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:54.830 align:start position:0%
evidence or sound medical
[Music]

01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
opinion I don't believe so no so there
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
is some standard other than fda's review
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
of um sound scientific evidence or sound
 
01:44:10.719 --> 01:44:11.910 align:start position:0%
of um sound scientific evidence or sound
medical

01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
opinion okay um I'm not quite sure what
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're asking to be
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
honest um it was my naive view that the
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
FDA made its decisions based on sound
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence or sound medical
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
opinion and I want to know if this is
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.189 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
no a quick followup followup Mr
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
chairman quick followup followup yes
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank um thank you representative cross
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience with me
 
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
um I is there a procedure within
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals medical centers and research
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
organizations and IRB approval that can
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
in fact approve off Lael use I'll have
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
to get back to you with that I I asked
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
the question representative because
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
having served for many many many years
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
on irbs it was not uncommon for such
 
01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
request to come before us okay thank you
 
01:45:19.149 --> 01:45:19.159 align:start position:0%
for the information thank you thank you
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative gay thank you
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
question uh for the record I fully uh
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
support the intent of this bill but I
 
01:45:34.109 --> 01:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
think uh when such use is lines five and
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
six when such use is based upon sound
 
01:45:39.149 --> 01:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence and sound medical
 
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
opinion is a complicating Factor here
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
because when you have people of great
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
experience who disagree with each other
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
that that would mean that you could not
 
01:45:57.390 --> 01:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
use uh off-label drugs for new purposes
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
if some other sound medical people
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
disagreed so I would strike that because
 
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
we're right now in the middle of this
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
across the world and in our own country
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
we have people who are medical experts
 
01:46:13.629 --> 01:46:13.639 align:start position:0%
who totally disagree and you could and
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
the problem is right now one side is
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
winning and the other side uh can't use
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh certain medications
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
for something that's never been tested
 
01:46:25.149 --> 01:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
even though that very product I'm
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
talking about hydroxy chloroquin is used
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
profoundly in this country for an off
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
Lael purpose for ra and lupus uh so I'm
 
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
thinking that is a very
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
restrictive uh phrase when such use is
 
01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
based upon sound scientific because you
 
01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
never get to use something for a new
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
purpose if the people who you know other
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
medical experts disagreed
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
that I do understand what you're saying
 
01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
as well but this would be based between
 
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
a provider and the patient so the
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
patient would
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
be trusting the sound medical advice of
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
that prescriber well that would be great
 
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry followup that would be great
 
01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
to put that phrase in that is that Mak
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
makes really good sense that it's
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
patient any further questions for the
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair question to
 
01:47:38.109 --> 01:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
the representative we just talked about
 
01:47:41.310 --> 01:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
informed consent um do you foresee a
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
need to have informed consent for off
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
label use or is that basically something
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
that is between the patient and the
 
01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
prescriber verbally or do you want it
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
some sort of a
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
um ability for the patient to understand
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
the drug that's being prescribed is in
 
01:47:58.510 --> 01:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
fact off label it's not something
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
indicated by the
 
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
FDA I do foresee that but I also know
 
01:48:07.589 --> 01:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
that informed consent comes along with
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
patient and
 
01:48:10.239 --> 01:48:12.790 align:start position:0%
patient and
prescriber

01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
prescriber
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm I trying to think of discretion
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
and when they're giving out medications
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
and you accept that medication a lot of
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
times informed
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
involved representative
 
01:48:32.669 --> 01:48:32.679 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um perhaps I
 
01:48:39.550 --> 01:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
should know this but I don't um
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
currently are Physicians or pharmacists
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
being disciplined for using off off
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
I have heard of a few I don't personally
 
01:48:59.470 --> 01:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
know but I could look into it more and
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
get back to
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
you representative gay one more that's
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
all I haven't figured out how to put
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
this in a form of a question um does
 
01:49:14.669 --> 01:49:14.679 align:start position:0%
anybody else have a question while the
 
01:49:16.629 --> 01:49:16.639 align:start position:0%
representatives is figuring out the
 
01:49:19.950 --> 01:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
rules of Jeopardy have you got it ready
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
now so uh are you aware that Dr Simone
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
gold was fired after she prescribed
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
hydroxy chloroquin which had already
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
been treated people in SARS Co
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
1 yes I think that was one of the
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
Weber I beg your pardon so that brings
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
me to the question of that I think has
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
actually been raised before perhaps by
 
01:49:53.199 --> 01:49:55.229 align:start position:0%
actually been raised before perhaps by
representative

01:49:55.229 --> 01:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
Merchant about specific differences
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
between being disciplined by a
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
regulatory body for an off label use
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
versus not following the um requirements
 
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
of one's
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
employer for a use do you see that there
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
is a difference there between uh what a
 
01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory board may do and what a an
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
employer or an organization who is
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
employing a particular person might
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
employment um I do believe that is a
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
hurdle that we could come
 
01:50:49.040 --> 01:51:00.910 align:start position:0%
hurdle that we could come
across

01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.709 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
chairman would you please define uh what
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
drugs when a prescription has been FDA
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
approved for safety but isn't used for
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:28.990 align:start position:0%
 
intention

01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
intention
 
01:51:32.550 --> 01:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
followup I didn't understand the
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
said so there's been many medications
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
that have been researched and used for
 
01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
one purpose but they find that it's
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
useful for another treatment for
 
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
something else so it's been an approved
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
for safety usage through the FDA but
 
01:51:56.589 --> 01:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
they found that like hydroxy chloroquin
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
was originally used to treat malaria but
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
now they're using it for
 
01:52:06.669 --> 01:52:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
much rep representative kerk um thank
 
01:52:12.069 --> 01:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I I guess I'm
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
still a little baffled by the inter
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
change earlier that sound opinion of the
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
provider because in general when we look
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
at the issue of gathering evidence for
 
01:52:26.589 --> 01:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
any intervention treatment um technical
 
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh device whatever it's based upon not
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
just one opinion uh in in in our
 
01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:36.679 align:start position:0%
literature and in our meetings we often
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
have fights over what the best treatment
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
for something is and people will differ
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
but then we try to reach a consensus
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
based upon best available scientific
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
evidence and no matter what it is some
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
people are going to disagree so if we
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
put in sound opinion of the provider
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
would that not just basically open the
 
01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
door to anybody doing anything they
 
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
please without any super any any uh
 
01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:02.510 align:start position:0%
please without any super any any uh
oversight

01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um I'm happy to look at the
 
01:53:09.069 --> 01:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you for coming before us
 
01:53:15.189 --> 01:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
today the chair recognizes
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Erica Leon she wants to
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
speak for three
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.310 align:start position:0%
speak for three
minutes

01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
fellow members of Health and Human
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
Services I want to start off by thanking
 
01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
representative cross for doing such an
 
01:53:47.149 --> 01:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
amazing job this is the first time she's
 
01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
been in person to a hearing and I think
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
that she did phenomenal with our new
 
01:53:56.669 --> 01:53:56.679 align:start position:0%
situation and handling what is a very
 
01:53:58.589 --> 01:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
stressful situation so I want to thank
 
01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
her very much when
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
I look at my background I was a medical
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
device analyst for a very long time I
 
01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
looked at regulatory approvals and when
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
you look at development of a
 
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical or a device the company
 
01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
looks to the first indication for that
 
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
they can have approved that first one
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
could be $10 million it could be $100
 
01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
million it could be $300 million to get
 
01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.390 align:start position:0%
million it could be $300 million to get
that

01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:28.109 --> 01:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
approval if they find other uses that
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
have significant benefit have enough
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
benefit that it overcomes the risk
 
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
they're still not going to do a clinical
 
01:54:36.589 --> 01:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
trial unless it's required for
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
reimbursement or unless there is enough
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
of a different use that they feel that
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
there's a need to really get that
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
approval over 20% I I've read over 20%
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
but in the past I've read a much higher
 
01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
percentage of drugs are used off label
 
01:54:55.149 --> 01:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
today right now it it it had not been
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
much of a concern in the past because we
 
01:55:00.430 --> 01:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
didn't have this High highly politicized
 
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
situation where suddenly your choice of
 
01:55:04.589 --> 01:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
medicine decides whether or not you're a
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
good person and it's really a shame
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
we've reached this point and I hope we
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
can back away from that Cliff um as we
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
look to all of these decisions and all
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
of this information off Lael medicine is
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
a little bit finding from the Nebraska
 
01:55:20.159 --> 01:55:22.270 align:start position:0%
a little bit finding from the Nebraska
Attorney

01:55:22.270 --> 01:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
Attorney
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
General when he was asked about the off
 
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
use of off-label
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
drugs healthare providers do not violate
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
the standard of care when they select
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
between two reasonable reasonable
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
approaches to Medicine regulations also
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
indicate the physicians may utilize
 
01:55:40.069 --> 01:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
reasonable investigative or unproven
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
therapies that reflect a reasonable
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
approach to medicine so long as
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
Physicians obtain written informed
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
patient consent informed consent
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
concerns a doctor duty to inform his or
 
01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
her patient and it includes telling
 
01:55:55.149 --> 01:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
patients about the true nature of the
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
pertinent ailment or condition the risks
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
of proposed treatment or procedure and
 
01:56:01.390 --> 01:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
the risks of any alternative methods of
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
treatment including the risks of failing
 
01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
to undergo any treatment at
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
all so this brings to the question of do
 
01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
we want an amendment that says that
 
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
there needs to be written informed
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
consent because if we do that we have to
 
01:56:19.149 --> 01:56:19.159 align:start position:0%
look at what's the approval for aspirin
 
01:56:20.830 --> 01:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
if we're going to tell a patient that
 
01:56:22.149 --> 01:56:22.159 align:start position:0%
they should be using it for fever
 
01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:23.719 align:start position:0%
reduction or if we should be using it
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
for blood pressure where there's not an
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
approval for blood pressure do we want
 
01:56:30.430 --> 01:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
that paper trail I think that having a
 
01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
strong indication that in controversial
 
01:56:34.750 --> 01:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
cases or in something where there's not
 
01:56:37.069 --> 01:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
a strong body of evidence it might be
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
prudent for that doctor to have in have
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
written informed consent but a solid
 
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
discussion documented in the in the
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
medical record between the patient and
 
01:56:47.709 --> 01:56:47.719 align:start position:0%
the provider should be able to cover
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
mden if that's the path that you're
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
planning to take um I I respect your
 
01:56:59.310 --> 01:56:59.320 align:start position:0%
opinion your experience with irbs
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
they're phenomenal when you're looking
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
at these really edge cases when it comes
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
time to look at something where there is
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
no evidence and there are no data that's
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
when we really need to step back and
 
01:57:12.069 --> 01:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's a large group of
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
professionals who are reviewing whether
 
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
or not this is a prudent step as we
 
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
start to collect data as we start to
 
01:57:22.109 --> 01:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
have information we get to a point where
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable people can disagree and
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable people can take a different
 
01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
path um as we do that we get that Wild
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
and Woolly practice of medicine that
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
happens as we try and find out what's
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
best we can't have consensus until we
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
have people practicing medicine working
 
01:57:42.069 --> 01:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
with their patients for their best
 
01:57:46.750 --> 01:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.870 --> 01:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely unheard of the idea a of
 
01:57:52.109 --> 01:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
doing anti-coagulation therapy for a
 
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
drug alluding stent after six months was
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
heresy but then we found out about late
 
01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:57.870 align:start position:0%
heresy but then we found out about late
stent

01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
stent
 
01:58:00.069 --> 01:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
thrombosis um what I want to make sure
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
we do is that we protect the practice of
 
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
medicine and we make sure that doctors
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be disciplined for
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
political reasons we need to go back to
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
the way that we used to work and make
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
sure that Physicians are free to talk
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
with their patients and find a solution
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
to improve their health outcomes thank
 
01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.550 align:start position:0%
to improve their health outcomes thank
you

01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:23.430 align:start position:0%
you
any

01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
um just speaking from a personal
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
question here uh I currently am on two
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
off label
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
drugs uh do I run the risk of some point
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
one of them possibly getting
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
political and and having to go off of it
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
even though it has been successfully
 
01:58:58.069 --> 01:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
treating an off label use for five years
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question I would
 
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
hope not um right now I think that a lot
 
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
of this is focused around ircon and
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
hydroxy chloroquin although we don't
 
01:59:10.069 --> 01:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
know what might come to come to be
 
01:59:12.189 --> 01:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
controversial in the future um you do
 
01:59:13.950 --> 01:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
run the risk that if there are data
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
collected and we find that um like with
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
some with the the Radine one of the ones
 
01:59:22.069 --> 01:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
for stomic acid that it actually causes
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
cancer there may be a need to find
 
01:59:25.990 --> 01:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
another therapy but that would be
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
because data are available that show a
 
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
risk and practice changes whether it's
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.669 --> 01:59:39.679 align:start position:0%
use representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking the question
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
patient from something that they should
 
01:59:54.189 --> 01:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
be protected from how do we protect the
 
01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
patient ultimately from a decision by a
 
01:59:59.950 --> 01:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
practitioner that wasn't in the best
 
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
interest and that's try to get to is
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
that it's that's the underlying concern
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
is that when you get the off label use a
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
lot of it's okay probably 99% of it 1%
 
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
of it could be a problem so how do we
 
02:00:15.069 --> 02:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
ultimately protect the
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
patient do you trust thank you for the
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
question and that is what becomes so
 
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
challenging when we're discussing these
 
02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
things that are so highly charged um do
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
you trust the patient and the doctor to
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
have a discussion about the facts and
 
02:00:33.069 --> 02:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
the data and to come to a conclusion or
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
do you feel that there needs to be
 
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
another person in the room with them
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
followup yes and no um having practiced
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
in Pharmacy and seeing many scripts
 
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
coming across my counter from some
 
02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
practitioners that I questioned I would
 
02:00:52.350 --> 02:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
say that there is a risk out there
 
02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
although it's small that we should not
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
ignore and somewhere along the way the
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
patient should be somewhat protected and
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned about that 1% how do
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
we protect the patient because it does
 
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
occur um thank you with with those
 
02:01:10.109 --> 02:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
prescriptions was that an issue of
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
contraindications or risks or that sort
 
02:01:14.430 --> 02:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
of problem or just a disagreement about
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
the treatment practice it was probably
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
more a disagreement on the treatment
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
practice but also when you go back to
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
look at opiate prescriptions right now
 
02:01:23.790 --> 02:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on is that we have patients
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
that are coming to the pharmacy by
 
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
practitioners that to use their license
 
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
prescribe opiates in
 
02:01:33.870 --> 02:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
un large amounts if you will but
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
someone's not protecting the patient
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
from opiate addiction so that's an
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
example I can use that's real life that
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
I do concern myself with is that there
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
are documented cases of prescribers that
 
02:01:49.069 --> 02:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
have abused their licensing privileges
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
to make Financial
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
benefits and I'm just concerned about
 
02:01:54.990 --> 02:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
that going on and not being somehow
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
contained um thank you um manipulating
 
02:02:03.870 --> 02:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
reaction uh this is one of those areas
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
where the doctors used to prescribe
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
cigarettes for nausea for women in
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
pregnancy uh what we need to do is
 
02:02:17.069 --> 02:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
instead of driving people underground
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
work to collect the data work to colle C
 
02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
the information because if we're able to
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
look at something where people have have
 
02:02:28.830 --> 02:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
data to point to for their use of a of a
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
medication off label if they have data
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
to point to them there should be some
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
collection of data it shouldn't be a
 
02:02:37.069 --> 02:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
requirement of this because this is
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
individual practice that will largely be
 
02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
H happening outside of the hospital
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
practices which have institutional
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
policies which likely will prohibit such
 
02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
um prescriptions but we need to
 
02:02:50.189 --> 02:02:50.199 align:start position:0%
encourage that collection of data so
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
that we can find out whether or not
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
there is harm and if the patient is part
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
of that part of the pursuit of using
 
02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
some of these some of these things off
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
label in order to um improve their
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
health I don't think that it's the role
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
of the government to get in Signal which
 
02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
opioids representative
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
Solway thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh just a quick question
 
02:03:26.910 --> 02:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh on line six it states and therefore
 
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
the board shall not take disciplinary or
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary remedial action does
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
this in any way protect practitioners
 
02:03:37.229 --> 02:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
from civil
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
suits in the event that there is an
 
02:03:44.189 --> 02:03:44.199 align:start position:0%
untoward effect of an off Lael
 
02:03:46.750 --> 02:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
use I don't see any thank you for the
 
02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
question I don't see any protection from
 
02:03:51.069 --> 02:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
that because if they are using something
 
02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
and if they' misled their patient um
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
having a good strong documentation about
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
their discussion of the risks and
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
benefits and the patients understanding
 
02:04:03.790 --> 02:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
of the limitations of the data should
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
protect them which means that they need
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
to have a strong discussion with this
 
02:04:10.030 --> 02:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
patient if you have a patient knocking
 
02:04:13.709 --> 02:04:13.719 align:start position:0%
down your door asking for one of these
 
02:04:16.109 --> 02:04:16.119 align:start position:0%
something off label they bear some of
 
02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
the responsibility as well if you come
 
02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
to a discussion on that and if they're
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
the one that bears the medical harm then
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
they are taking responsibility for that
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
harm um when when you look to the
 
02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
disciplinary or non-disciplinary those
 
02:04:31.470 --> 02:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
words are actually in the rules for the
 
02:04:33.870 --> 02:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
licensing board and that's part that's
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
why the words of disciplinary or
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary are in this uh in this
 
02:04:44.069 --> 02:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you representative
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
kerk thank you I'm uh still a little
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
baffled about how we Define this issue
 
02:04:51.390 --> 02:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
of sound scientific evidence sound
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
medical opinion or I think you use the
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
word reasonable evidence um and this
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
kind of dubils into that question of
 
02:04:59.709 --> 02:04:59.719 align:start position:0%
what what we expect people to do for an
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
informed consent if we talk about doing
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
that because you have to then give both
 
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
sides in a in a sense educate the person
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
as to the risks of each of those whether
 
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to use the off label or not
 
02:05:14.350 --> 02:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
use the off label and what the opinion
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
is not just yours but the opinion of the
 
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
weight of scientific evidence we have um
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
H so this is kind of squishy and not
 
02:05:25.709 --> 02:05:25.719 align:start position:0%
defined which so isn't that what the
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
role of the Board of Medicine would be
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
is to look at sure Board of anybody it
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
could be uh pas and so on to be able to
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
look at that question of did that person
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
follow what was sound evidence and not
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
just say it's the opinion of the
 
02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
practitioner because that seems to be
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
what was being stated am I confused on
 
02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:51.149 align:start position:0%
what was being stated am I confused on
this

02:05:51.149 --> 02:05:51.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh so what can I clarify that question
 
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
for you you're asking
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
if having if simply being able to point
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
to Scientific evidence or medical
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
opinion should be reason that they do
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
not are not subject to disciplinary
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
action um I'm sorry I did probably ask
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
that poorly um the bottom line is sort
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
of how do we Define what sound
 
02:06:17.790 --> 02:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence or sound medical
 
02:06:19.629 --> 02:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
opinion is
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
um it's not just what might be
 
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable to think of sometime but what
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
is the predominance of evidence that is
 
02:06:28.270 --> 02:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
currently available and so I'm trying to
 
02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
figure out how when we put some this in
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
statute we haven't defined how that's
 
02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.149 align:start position:0%
statute we haven't defined how that's
determined

02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
determined
 
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh the if you start defining how it's
 
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
determined you're getting into issues
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
about requiring an informed consent form
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
for aspirin for blood thinning so we we
 
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
need to be careful about where those
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
educations are perhaps it's a matter of
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
having an amendment where in sub cases
 
02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:56.310 align:start position:0%
having an amendment where in sub cases
of

02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:06:59.149 --> 02:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
controversy um the doctor must have
 
02:07:01.069 --> 02:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
notes as to the points of evidence
 
02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
referred to and the discussion with the
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
patient um because if they are
 
02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
discussing the data that are available
 
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
there doesn't need to be consensus I'm
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
not sure I assume you're the American
 
02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
Academy of orthopedic surgeons and the
 
02:07:18.069 --> 02:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
swine surgeons I was shocked about how
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
many years it took for a new therapy to
 
02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
make it into the consensus guidelines
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes that was eight years and think
 
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
about the lives that would be harmed if
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
you waited for consensus to come around
 
02:07:32.189 --> 02:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
so we need to balance this in the
 
02:07:34.830 --> 02:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine but I I do think
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
that um I believe uh representative
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
cross will agree with me that there's
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
some been really good points raised and
 
02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
I think it's a matter of looking for
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
some amendments to clarify this but what
 
02:07:47.470 --> 02:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
we need to do is make sure that we're
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
not stifling that practice of medicine
 
02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
while also making sure that we're not
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
giving doctors a license to again
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
prescribe cigarettes for nausea and
 
02:07:58.669 --> 02:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
pregnancy thank
 
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much for your testimony
 
02:08:06.350 --> 02:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
the chair now calls James Stewart from
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
Rochester wave off thank you James
 
02:08:11.069 --> 02:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
Stewart from
 
02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:14.679 align:start position:0%
Rochester and you're a citizen and you
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to this bill in
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
favor of Welcome hi thank
 
02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to speak a little less
 
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
intellectually or scientifically or
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislatively and speak more plainly
 
02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully my diag log is a little more
 
02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:36.990 align:start position:0%
hopefully my diag log is a little more
plain

02:08:36.990 --> 02:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
plain
 
02:08:39.549 --> 02:08:39.559 align:start position:0%
fear I can see some of you are wearing
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
masks and you're wearing masks because
 
02:08:43.229 --> 02:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
you're trying to protect others etc etc
 
02:08:47.069 --> 02:08:47.079 align:start position:0%
because you're afraid you're afraid of
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
Co the
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
media and various
 
02:08:57.149 --> 02:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
politicians and the NIH and various
 
02:08:59.470 --> 02:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
interests have made
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
it very easy for us to be
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
fearful we're afraid of
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
covid I have a cousin who died of covid
 
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
probably didn't have to my thought
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
is that the hospital protocol killed
 
02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.950 align:start position:0%
is that the hospital protocol killed
him

02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
well you saywell what are we to do well
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
first of all let's just admit there's
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
more and more evidence coming out around
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
the world folks around the world the
 
02:09:30.669 --> 02:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
evidence is there if you look don't
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
listen to the popular media to the to
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
the letter
 
02:09:38.669 --> 02:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
stations the covid shot which is a
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
genetic uh experimental genetic liquid
 
02:09:44.669 --> 02:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
that they inject you allow them to
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
inject into you is not safe it is not
 
02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:48.910 align:start position:0%
inject into you is not safe it is not
effective

02:09:48.910 --> 02:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
effective
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
well then what are we to do we must do
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
something you're trying to do something
 
02:09:55.069 --> 02:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
everyone's probably do trying to do
 
02:09:56.910 --> 02:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
something even if you're not wearing a
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
mask you're probably trying to do
 
02:10:01.229 --> 02:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
something you you're using antibacterial
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
methods with your hands etc etc you're
 
02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
distancing all like we want to do
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
something here's something we can do
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
doctors there's been times in the past
 
02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
when we've bled people at some point
 
02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
some doctors say no we can't do that
 
02:10:18.669 --> 02:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
anymore it's harmful what if someone
 
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
came along and said no you must continue
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
to bleed them no you can't use
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
penicillin no aspirin is only for this
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
doctors are
 
02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:29.639 align:start position:0%
doctors they sometimes use off Lael
 
02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
drugs it's just the way it is doctors
 
02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
around the world have discovered yes in
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
India where they they're destroying
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
covid by using
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
icin in Israel where they're finding
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
that I guess the shot or the booster or
 
02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
the third booster or the fourth booster
 
02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
like they're talking about six boosters
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
in the Netherlands right now do you know
 
02:10:53.549 --> 02:10:53.559 align:start position:0%
that how effective it is a
 
02:10:56.589 --> 02:10:56.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine that you need six boosters come
 
02:10:58.830 --> 02:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
on let's admit it it's not safe it's not
 
02:11:01.629 --> 02:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
effective we need something else maybe a
 
02:11:03.069 --> 02:11:03.079 align:start position:0%
lot of something else and it's certainly
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
not M desia which killed my
 
02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
friend about four weeks ago they denied
 
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
her Ivor mechon denied it the lady was
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
dying doesn't she get her
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
choice come on in enable people there
 
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
was some questions here about who gets
 
02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility who gets the choice
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
people can do their D du diligence look
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
into it and choose for
 
02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
themselves we are still Sovereign people
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
in this nation we don't tell other
 
02:11:35.149 --> 02:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
people what they inject into their
 
02:11:37.149 --> 02:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
bodies or what they cannot
 
02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
use if you start doing that uh you're
 
02:11:42.910 --> 02:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
going to be here not just for a couple
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
hours you're going to be here for days
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
months years because you have revamp the
 
02:11:49.629 --> 02:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
entire system let people decide give
 
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
them the responsibility the doctor's
 
02:11:55.990 --> 02:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
advise they decide give them
 
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
hey if you want to give them all the
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
information like inform formed consent
 
02:12:05.709 --> 02:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
how about if we do that about the co
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
shot we're not doing that there's a lot
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
more to know about that Co shot than
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
people know it's being covered up by you
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
name it I can go down through the list
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
all the Medias the Twitter's the the the
 
02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:19.990 align:start position:0%
all the Medias the Twitter's the the the
the

02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
politicians some doctors the NIH I mean
 
02:12:25.709 --> 02:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
what why would fouchi want to cover this
 
02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
up well he's the one who funded the NIH
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
who and he knows that they funded that
 
02:12:33.629 --> 02:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
in Wuhan when this first happened I went
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
Wuhan I looked up on my phone I mean
 
02:12:38.229 --> 02:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
it's obvious in Wuhan is a coron virus
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
research facility duh of course it came
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
from there didn't come some animal this
 
02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
was UPF funded by Dr fouchy he wants to
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
cover this up he knows Ivon works ion
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
saves lives who are we to be telling
 
02:12:54.990 --> 02:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
doctors who have
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
studied and people who also study as
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
individual Sovereign citizens of the
 
02:13:01.229 --> 02:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire that they cannot
 
02:13:01.239 --> 02:13:02.350 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire that they cannot
use

02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
ion to save their life or the life of
 
02:13:06.990 --> 02:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
their their loved one if they see their
 
02:13:09.149 --> 02:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
loved one going down the path to death
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't they get to choose to try that if
 
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
we stop doctors from trying things like
 
02:13:18.750 --> 02:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
that off label we're going to sever
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
the re part of the research that doctors
 
02:13:25.390 --> 02:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
do in real life situations they discover
 
02:13:28.030 --> 02:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
things and then it becomes known and
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
pretty soon it changes the way we look
 
02:13:33.229 --> 02:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
at something and it saves
 
02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
lives we need this we need these let's
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
just admit it this is mostly about
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
hydroxy chlorin chloroquin and
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
chloroquin and ican and there are some
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
others but doctors are afraid I talked
 
02:13:50.669 --> 02:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
about fear initially doctors are
 
02:13:53.390 --> 02:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
afraid and they don't want to go against
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
the protocol that it's given them from
 
02:13:55.159 --> 02:13:58.549 align:start position:0%
the protocol that it's given them from
up

02:13:58.549 --> 02:13:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
above enable them to save lives that's
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
what they want to do Do no harm they
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
know that doing harm with we Desir and
 
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
some of the other things that they're
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
left with give them all the tools to
 
02:14:12.350 --> 02:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
save lives don't deny them pass this
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill any questions thank you sir thank
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
you so much questions done a lot of res
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
resarch into this believe me thank
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:44.669 --> 02:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
you so sitting here listening to all the
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I was wondering I just wanted
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
to ask everyone here who's not
 
02:14:50.910 --> 02:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill why do doctors go to
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
medical school in full disclosure I'm a
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
paramedic critical care and flight
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
certified and fto training officer and
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
I've done training in EMT and paramedic
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
for about 10 years it's about as much
 
02:15:02.549 --> 02:15:02.559 align:start position:0%
training as a PA roughly as far as all
 
02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
the schooling and clinicals um so
 
02:15:07.229 --> 02:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
technically the advanced provider um
 
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
doctors however go to school for longer
 
02:15:10.030 --> 02:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
right they go to school for four years
 
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
four years of medical school
 
02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
certifications and tests and uh
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
residency of between three and 8 years
 
02:15:18.549 --> 02:15:18.559 align:start position:0%
or longer and maybe fellowships of
 
02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
another I don't know 5 10 years so why
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
do they go through all that and finish
 
02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
school at 40 with a half million dollars
 
02:15:26.189 --> 02:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
of debt it's to learn medicine how to
 
02:15:28.030 --> 02:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
treat patients appropriately right it's
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
not how to follow a cookbook even I can
 
02:15:33.149 --> 02:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
follow a basic cookbook right so they go
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
to school for extra 20 30 years and give
 
02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
up their lives and go into dep forever
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
to learn how to treat patients so I
 
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
think we should let them treat patients
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
instead of making them uh into cookbook
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
cookbook practitioners like you say in
 
02:15:49.229 --> 02:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
medicine um um you call them like you
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
know textbook cookbook monkeys um I
 
02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
think this bill at at its core is really
 
02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
about do we want doctors to be follow a
 
02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
cookbooks or allow them to use their
 
02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
brains I know representative cross and
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
some others mentioned some off Lael uses
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
an off Lael like they mentioned is not
 
02:16:06.990 --> 02:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
really a great term because it makes it
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
sound like it's kind of taken a risk and
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
there's no science or data uh supporting
 
02:16:15.229 --> 02:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
a use of a certain medication they
 
02:16:17.790 --> 02:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
brought up you know uh selenophile
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
phosph race 5 inhibitors for for Ed were
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
originally used for pulmonary
 
02:16:23.470 --> 02:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
hypertension they Vis dilate then they
 
02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
found obviously a tremendous side effect
 
02:16:26.990 --> 02:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
that became more financially rewarding
 
02:16:29.229 --> 02:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
business but it's not just that it's
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
there are tons of medications right now
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
I think representative Leon mentioned
 
02:16:34.589 --> 02:16:34.599 align:start position:0%
maybe 20 30% of or more of medications
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
are used technically off label all off
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
Lael means by my understanding is the
 
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
FDA approves a drug and they approve it
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
the drug and for a specific use maybe
 
02:16:45.549 --> 02:16:45.559 align:start position:0%
one use maybe multiple uses anytime a
 
02:16:47.309 --> 02:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
doctor prescribes that to a patient
 
02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
after examining them and getting to know
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
the patient personally and having a
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
discussion between a patient and a
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
doctor anytime he prescribes that
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
medication for anything besides for the
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
one specific use approved by the FDA
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's technically considered off Lael so
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to put it out there first
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
that off Lael doesn't mean crazy doctor
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
being a cowboy throwing random drugs at
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
a certain disease it means it's
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
literally not approved by the FDA for
 
02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
that specific purpose but could be safe
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
um in an article I I wrote and I'll
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
submit this in the evidence I'll email
 
02:17:19.469 --> 02:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
the committee um I think there were 70
 
02:17:21.389 --> 02:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
studies or 100 studies of icin proving
 
02:17:24.270 --> 02:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
it is safe and effective with uh Corona
 
02:17:26.509 --> 02:17:26.519 align:start position:0%
virus hydroxy chloroquin I think also
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
100 over 100 studies proving it is safe
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
and effective of course both of those
 
02:17:31.589 --> 02:17:31.599 align:start position:0%
drugs happen to have been approved by
 
02:17:35.469 --> 02:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
the FDA um for other diseases not covid
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
but approved by the FDA as very safe
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
decades ago 50 80 100 years ago of
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
course they used hydroxy chloric wiin
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
and icin used all over the world from
 
02:17:46.349 --> 02:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
Africa to India extremely safely safely
 
02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
you know uh very very few negative side
 
02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
effects um I I would say I I'm
 
02:17:53.230 --> 02:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill and I'm asking the
 
02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:54.519 align:start position:0%
committee to support the bill but with
 
02:17:56.669 --> 02:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
an amendment I was thinking before and
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'm glad I think representative gay
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned it the part about being uh
 
02:18:04.030 --> 02:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
sound medical judgment or sound uh
 
02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
Medical Science and consensus has to be
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
stricken because unfortunately nowadays
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't like this 100 years ago
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
now it's all politicized if you ask
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
people on one side of the aisle they'll
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
say everon is safe and effective and of
 
02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
course I have hundreds of stud need to
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
prove that if you ask people on another
 
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
side of an aisle they might say Aon is
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
the most dangerous substance in the
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
universe if you touch it you will die um
 
02:18:26.990 --> 02:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
in fact the FDA themselves said you're
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
not a darn horse don't take icin it's
 
02:18:30.030 --> 02:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
going to be dangerous for you don't take
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
it for Co so it's been politicized and
 
02:18:35.309 --> 02:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
right now if this part remains in the
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
bill saying doctors can only approve
 
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
things or prescribe medications that are
 
02:18:44.190 --> 02:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
you know with sound medical judgment who
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
would determine what the sound uh
 
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
medical judgment means it would be be
 
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
the FDA and the FDA has already made it
 
02:18:51.509 --> 02:18:51.519 align:start position:0%
known that they believe everon is the
 
02:18:52.830 --> 02:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
most dangerous substance in the universe
 
02:18:56.990 --> 02:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much um so there goes that um as
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
far as one of the representatives on the
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
committee asked are doctor is it
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
currently happening yes I think I have
 
02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
heard of doctors um being threatened by
 
02:19:05.309 --> 02:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
the the AMA or other board certification
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
associations and I think some have lost
 
02:19:10.429 --> 02:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
their licenses for not supporting um uh
 
02:19:12.750 --> 02:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
not opposing and crushing everm dark
 
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
clor Quinn um I think some states
 
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
actually banned it I think New York
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
prevented an unprecedented tyrannical
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
move prevented doctors from prescribing
 
02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
erectin andal chloroquin um to patients
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
with coron virus which again we should
 
02:19:27.389 --> 02:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
not be getting between doctors and
 
02:19:28.990 --> 02:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
patients and someone mentioned I think
 
02:19:30.270 --> 02:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
earlier on the committee that you're
 
02:19:31.950 --> 02:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
going to wrap it up now you asked for
 
02:19:34.030 --> 02:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
three to five minutes and we got to move
 
02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
on so let me give you one more minute
 
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you um and and the final
 
02:19:40.750 --> 02:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
point someone mentioned um should there
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
also be informed consent required and
 
02:19:43.629 --> 02:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
are we worried about patients being
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
protected um nothing would change this
 
02:19:47.950 --> 02:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't say doctors can kill
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
patients with without any repercussions
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
patients could still Sue so if I go to
 
02:19:52.830 --> 02:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
my doctor have a discussion with him we
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
both agree econ is the right choice for
 
02:19:56.349 --> 02:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
me or any drug for this exact purpose is
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
the right choice that's we agreed to it
 
02:20:00.190 --> 02:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
we both have some responsibility if it
 
02:20:01.830 --> 02:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
happens to be that drug kills me and
 
02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
there was a contraindication I didn't
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
know about and the doctor didn't know
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
about what I should have I can still sue
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
him you know I could still bring him to
 
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
court for that and he could still be
 
02:20:10.429 --> 02:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
punished criminally or Civ so this
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take away from that this
 
02:20:13.389 --> 02:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily get rid of all
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
repercussions um as far as a doctor
 
02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
being punished for hurting a patient so
 
02:20:20.110 --> 02:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:22.349 --> 02:20:22.359 align:start position:0%

Sullivan

02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
Sullivan
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
7 and I live in the town of aworth um I
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
did send you written testimony via email
 
02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to read it but what I want
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
to say is um very interesting discussion
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
on this uh piece proposed
 
02:21:12.990 --> 02:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
legislation I think there are some uh
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know issues that need to be teased
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
out but bottom line is you know we
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
talked a lot
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
about physician uh pharmacies and
 
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
pharmacists that you know maybe afraid
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
of getting sued or malpractice suits or
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
whatever and trying to protect that 1%
 
02:21:38.270 --> 02:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
from some doctor that might not be
 
02:21:44.110 --> 02:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
helpful how about we also talk about
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
about all of
 
02:21:54.190 --> 02:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
those people who were prescribed
 
02:21:56.590 --> 02:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
medication went to the
 
02:21:58.990 --> 02:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and couldn't get a
 
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:00.309 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and couldn't get a
prescription

02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
filled and then went home
 
02:22:06.670 --> 02:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
empty-handed and proceeded to get worse
 
02:22:09.150 --> 02:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
with their ill
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
illness we have to think there is a
 
02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
balance here as representative L wisely
 
02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
I think it's really a
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
shame that we can't seem to be providing
 
02:22:32.190 --> 02:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
people who have prescription from their
 
02:22:36.349 --> 02:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
doctor with the drugs that have been P
 
02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
prescribed and what ultimately happens
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
is then you have a situation where black
 
02:22:44.429 --> 02:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
markets emerge people are getting their
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
medication from places like Tractor
 
02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:48.510 align:start position:0%
medication from places like Tractor
Supply

02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
02:22:51.389 --> 02:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
really is this is what we want I don't
 
02:22:51.399 --> 02:22:52.429 align:start position:0%
really is this is what we want I don't
think

02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:22:55.630 --> 02:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
so that's not the kind of medical care
 
02:22:56.910 --> 02:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
that we should
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
be you know
 
02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
that if a doctor prescribes a drug
 
02:23:09.230 --> 02:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
biologic or
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
device that prescription should be
 
02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
honored and that's really all I need I
 
02:23:18.190 --> 02:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
came to say today is
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
I'm more worried about the people who
 
02:23:22.269 --> 02:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
are being prescribed legitimate
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
medication from their legitimate
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
doctor and then being turned away from a
 
02:23:30.750 --> 02:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacy because some for some reason
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy and pharmacist decide that
 
02:23:35.269 --> 02:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
this is not the treatment that they
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:23:39.710 --> 02:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
getting I don't agree with that so thank
 
02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
you for listening and I hope that you
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
will uh pass this bill with whatever
 
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
decide Kel representative
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
Kelsey thank you Mr chairman um would
 
02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
you agree that this bill should be
 
02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
amended to include all prescribers and
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
not only
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians I think that's a
 
02:24:10.590 --> 02:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:13.950 --> 02:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
you representative gay thank you for
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question and comment are you
 
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
aware that
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
um most pharmacies mostes at least in my
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
town I called every one of them and
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
every chain had forbidden them for
 
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
filling prescriptions for covid that
 
02:24:34.590 --> 02:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
that uh were either icin or hydroxy
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
chloroquin I had heard of that everyone
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
I had heard of that that people were
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
getting prescriptions to be treated with
 
02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
ior macton uh early on in their covid um
 
02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:47.469 align:start position:0%
ior macton uh early on in their covid um
illness

02:24:47.469 --> 02:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
illness
 
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
and were denied when they went to the
 
02:24:52.110 --> 02:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to have their prescription
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
filled they were denied so what are
 
02:24:57.790 --> 02:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
these people are supposed to do um then
 
02:25:00.190 --> 02:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
this is where we turn to black market
 
02:25:02.190 --> 02:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
situations where people are getting
 
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
things and God knows what other things
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
they might be getting that they are not
 
02:25:08.110 --> 02:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
prescribed by their
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
doctor followup one followup are you
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%

often um my name is Russ anchester I'm a
 
02:25:59.710 --> 02:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
resident of Bedford New Hampshire um
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
have been a resident of New Hampshire
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
since for 61 years I was prescribed an
 
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
off Market prescription uh three years
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
ago four years ago now um and when that
 
02:26:15.309 --> 02:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
prescription became part of the
 
02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
political profile I could no longer get
 
02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
it and that was devastating um I had to
 
02:26:25.389 --> 02:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
find Alternatives I worked very closely
 
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
with my physician to try and find the
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
Alternatives because initially my
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
physician was prescribing it and the
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
pharmacy wouldn't fill it now the
 
02:26:39.389 --> 02:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
current problem is my physician has been
 
02:26:44.590 --> 02:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
told by her employer that um they are
 
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
not to be Contin continuing that
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
prescription with me because it is an
 
02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
off whatever um and
 
02:26:59.269 --> 02:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
um that um she's not willing to at this
 
02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
time leave her employment and she has
 
02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
been told that prescribing that
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
prescription to me will um result in um
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
potentially her losing her license
 
02:27:14.910 --> 02:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
additionally um I
 
02:27:17.389 --> 02:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
02:27:19.070 --> 02:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
I have a
 
02:27:22.110 --> 02:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
um situation where my partner is
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated I am not vaccinated I'm
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine injured not from covid but I
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
can't take the vaccine for covid because
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
of that um my partner less than 24 hours
 
02:27:38.269 --> 02:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
after receiving his booster um was
 
02:27:41.870 --> 02:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
hospitalized for three days we tried we
 
02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
at well before the hospitalization 24
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
hours he started coming down with some
 
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
symptoms of covid-19 we asked for um ior
 
02:27:54.429 --> 02:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
mechon and the various um other
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
opportunities and it was a Flatout no it
 
02:27:59.870 --> 02:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
was actually said if you're experiencing
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
difficulties go to the emergency room um
 
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
which just is exactly the opposite of
 
02:28:08.349 --> 02:28:08.359 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing we don't want to
 
02:28:10.429 --> 02:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
overwhelm our hospitals and our doctors
 
02:28:12.269 --> 02:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
are being told that's what they have to
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
say um I had the same experience I
 
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
developed covid um I chose to go to
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
tractor buy and other places to get what
 
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
I needed because I learned that in my
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
other off prescription drug it worked so
 
02:28:34.030 --> 02:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
um I was willing to give it a try and uh
 
02:28:38.830 --> 02:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
I but I had full for informed consent um
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
this is a problem that we're having now
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
is um doctors are fearful for their
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
license they're making it very clear my
 
02:28:49.870 --> 02:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
doctor will not give me an exemption for
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 vaccine right now because
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
she is too afraid that she has been told
 
02:29:00.429 --> 02:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
by her employer to a certain extent
 
02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
unless I'm absolutely sure it'll kill
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
you I can't give you an exemption now
 
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm vaccine injured I mean this is
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
important and this is now the vaccine is
 
02:29:12.269 --> 02:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
just we're not talking about the vaccine
 
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily but it's all part of the
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
conclusion it's when
 
02:29:19.630 --> 02:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
prescriptions become when medications
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
become politicized follow the money
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more money to be made in
 
02:29:28.389 --> 02:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
all the all the ways that we're being
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
told to treat this than there are not
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
like I said my op prescription drug
 
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
never had a problem until
 
02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
2021 thank you so much for your
 
02:29:43.230 --> 02:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and the final pink card is
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're bringing back the honorable Linda
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:53.070 --> 02:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
Bedford am I right in assuming you're a
 
02:29:57.150 --> 02:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
nurse on RN yes sir okay thought

02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
charged testimony for me um I'm a
 
02:30:13.439 --> 02:30:14.910 align:start position:0%
charged testimony for me um I'm a
researcher

02:30:14.910 --> 02:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
researcher
 
02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
by Nature
 
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
and I've researched covid since the very
 
02:30:24.269 --> 02:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
beginning I love um Public Health I love
 
02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
data so there's good bad and ugly to
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
anything we have only heard one side of
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
the picture I think we all understand
 
02:30:36.190 --> 02:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
that there's been
 
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
censorship I've lived I'm old enough
 
02:30:41.790 --> 02:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
that I've lived through the swine flu in
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
the 70s and we had gilean Beret side
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
effects I've lived through the HIV AIDS
 
02:30:50.590 --> 02:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
where in 1981 we had no idea what was
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
going on and it was very
 
02:30:54.710 --> 02:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
politicized I've lived through mer
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
Middle Eastern uh respiratory zika Ebola
 
02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:02.110 align:start position:0%
Middle Eastern uh respiratory zika Ebola
now

02:31:02.110 --> 02:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
K2 off label prescriptions you've heard
 
02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
already is very are very customary I'm
 
02:31:11.230 --> 02:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
on one myself to Echo what the prior
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
speaker said um my supply of my off
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
label which I need to take was held up
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
politicization of this
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
illness as a registered nurse and
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
Physicians and pharmacist we do know
 
02:31:29.710 --> 02:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
harm well there's a lot of harm that has
 
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
been done in the last 20
 
02:31:35.550 --> 02:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
months and if you're paying attention
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
you already know that that something is
 
02:31:39.389 --> 02:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
desperately a
 
02:31:44.429 --> 02:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
mess we value our patient physician
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
relationship it is
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
Priceless and all of a sudden we aren't
 
02:31:53.950 --> 02:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
giving our physicians due uh respect
 
02:31:55.950 --> 02:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
they've gone to school for about 12
 
02:31:58.830 --> 02:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
years um Physicians should and need
 
02:32:01.269 --> 02:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
autonomy they don't want somebody over
 
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
their shoulder telling them how to
 
02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:04.550 align:start position:0%
their shoulder telling them how to
practice

02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:32:07.030 --> 02:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
medicine and my personal experience and
 
02:32:09.550 --> 02:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
this is why it's emotional is I've had
 
02:32:12.110 --> 02:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
the most wonderful physician primary
 
02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:13.550 align:start position:0%
the most wonderful physician primary
physician

02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
physician
 
02:32:16.990 --> 02:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
for maybe 15 years maybe 20
 
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
he was like right out of school when I
 
02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
first started working with him as my
 
02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:24.510 align:start position:0%
first started working with him as my
physician

02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
physician
 
02:32:28.590 --> 02:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
and I went for a physical in September
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
and I said to my wonderful
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
physician doc if I get sick with this
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
thing because time is I felt like my
 
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
time was running out then I'm next and I
 
02:32:41.950 --> 02:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
looked him right in the eye and I adore
 
02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
this physician he said if I get sick
 
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
with this are you you going to be able
 
02:32:50.590 --> 02:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
to help me before I get in the hospital
 
02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
are you going to be able to offer
 
02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
treatment you going to be able to
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
prescribe ior meton and there was this
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
dead silence for about it felt like
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
forever but it was probably about 10
 
02:33:06.269 --> 02:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
seconds he looked down no eye
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
contact looked up and said he couldn't
 
02:33:13.630 --> 02:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
because his Association would take his
 
02:33:16.429 --> 02:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
license I cannot look at my physician
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
anymore I don't even know if I can go
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
back to him because we had such a
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
fabulous relationship and I haven't been
 
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
able to deal with the idea that he's
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
lost track of his oath and his purpose
 
02:33:35.630 --> 02:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
in being a physician so I ask that you
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
support this bill if it needs tweaking
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
tweak it as you are competent in doing
 
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
but we cannot be having big ENT entities
 
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
telling our physicians how to practice
 
02:33:51.349 --> 02:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
medicine it destroys the patient
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
physician relationship and we are all
 
02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
susceptable to learning what I learned
 
02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:57.550 align:start position:0%
susceptable to learning what I learned
in

02:33:57.550 --> 02:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:34:01.349 --> 02:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
September and i' be happy to take any

prepared

02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:59.269 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

02:35:59.269 --> 02:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of this is the
 
02:36:04.590 --> 02:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
politicization I remember as a kid I was
 
02:36:07.950 --> 02:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
on a certain thing and was a combination
 
02:36:10.429 --> 02:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
of our local Standalone Pharmacy
 
02:36:13.950 --> 02:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and our family doctors you
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
know that might work and they tried it
 
02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:36.150 align:start position:0%
know that might work and they tried it
it

02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
worked see the problem NE we had aoke
 
02:36:42.030 --> 02:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who thought he knew more than
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
everybody else and so he didn't just do
 
02:36:46.429 --> 02:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
a wise
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
cautious asked a few other use of off
 
02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
lab this guy was a
 
02:36:56.910 --> 02:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
cowboy and so that has poisoned the well
 
02:37:00.510 --> 02:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
to this idea down where I live because
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:17.550 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:37:17.550 --> 02:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is where I hope our committee will
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
rise to our usual great thing of being
 
02:37:28.990 --> 02:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.800 --> 02:38:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:44.710 align:start position:0%
 
situ

02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.720 --> 03:21:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:21:22.389 --> 03:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:26.030 --> 03:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
might cover do you think that a
 
03:21:30.229 --> 03:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
Solo solo employer or solo um attendant
 
03:21:32.469 --> 03:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
provision might solve both of those
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
problems I can see where um article
 
03:21:38.429 --> 03:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
three where they're talking about um why
 
03:21:42.150 --> 03:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh a a customer not be allowed back for
 
03:21:46.030 --> 03:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
the health and safety to the customer or
 
03:21:47.429 --> 03:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
the shop
 
03:21:55.870 --> 03:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:00.150 --> 03:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
you representative gay thank you uh Mr
 
03:22:02.110 --> 03:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
question like the handicap tags I don't
 
03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know the proper term but you
 
03:22:10.269 --> 03:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
know a car tag has an expiration date um
 
03:22:11.830 --> 03:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
you either get a blue one that lasts
 
03:22:14.110 --> 03:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
forever or you get a red one with the
 
03:22:18.030 --> 03:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
dates put on it so I was just wondering
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh in order to pass this it's nice to
 
03:22:22.990 --> 03:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
know what the cards have looked like
 
03:22:26.469 --> 03:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
successfully in other states uh and do
 
03:22:28.110 --> 03:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
they have an expiration like you're not
 
03:22:31.110 --> 03:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
going to be pregnant forever but but
 
03:22:33.750 --> 03:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
hope not oh my goodness but at certain
 
03:22:36.670 --> 03:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
ages we would need the card forever so
 
03:22:39.150 --> 03:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh that's what I was just
 
03:22:41.349 --> 03:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
wondering uh I haven't seen one of the
 
03:22:43.630 --> 03:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
cards I I'm hoping that someone who is
 
03:22:45.309 --> 03:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
uh familiar with this perhaps the person
 
03:22:47.309 --> 03:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
who requested this of me will be here
 
03:22:49.309 --> 03:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
and can talk about that I think that's a
 
03:22:52.269 --> 03:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
great idea checking with those other oh
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know 300 states that have
 
03:22:56.750 --> 03:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
already done this and it's followup
 
03:22:59.830 --> 03:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
followup so it's your medical provider
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
and I noticed that you did say you
 
03:23:04.990 --> 03:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
didn't say doctor you said somewhere in
 
03:23:07.269 --> 03:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
here it says a it's under three on the
 
03:23:12.870 --> 03:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
last page okay but any
 
03:23:14.469 --> 03:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I haven't found it yet but I trust
 
03:23:16.229 --> 03:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
you that oh excuse me it's under it's
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
under uh one um when I first created
 
03:23:24.150 --> 03:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
this I asked for all of the possible uh
 
03:23:26.590 --> 03:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
cards that someone could use that can
 
03:23:28.349 --> 03:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
certainly be narrowed down we can
 
03:23:31.070 --> 03:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
certainly say it's it can only be from a
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
health provider and that the card has to
 
03:23:36.830 --> 03:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
look like such and such or um I know the
 
03:23:39.990 --> 03:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
National Organization for this for IBS
 
03:23:42.429 --> 03:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
also um manages this really well we
 
03:23:44.070 --> 03:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
should contact them and see if they've
 
03:23:48.269 --> 03:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
got an idea but it's more than I'm sorry
 
03:23:51.229 --> 03:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
followup followup one more but it does
 
03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
cover this would cover many causes not
 
03:23:58.110 --> 03:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
just Crohn's disease so it sounds
 
03:23:59.309 --> 03:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it wouldn't it be more
 
03:24:01.510 --> 03:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable to have the medical provider
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
figure out whether somebody needed it
 
03:24:06.630 --> 03:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
and not have to justify which condition
 
03:24:09.070 --> 03:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
made that absolutely your your medical
 
03:24:11.309 --> 03:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
provider could could certainly make sure
 
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
that all of the requirements are filled
 
03:24:13.840 --> 03:24:16.309 align:start position:0%
that all of the requirements are filled
thank

03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:18.670 --> 03:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:24:21.150 --> 03:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
fome thank you chairman Pearson and
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this bill um
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
having had lived with someone who had an
 
03:24:30.750 --> 03:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
ostomy for many years and we did at
 
03:24:34.710 --> 03:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
times have to go a panic to the counter
 
03:24:38.309 --> 03:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
and say do you have a restroom
 
03:24:42.670 --> 03:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
um he my former husband carried a a card
 
03:24:45.790 --> 03:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
with him from UAA it was not signed by
 
03:24:49.510 --> 03:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
any doctor um United ostomy Association
 
03:24:54.070 --> 03:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
of America had a card and with that
 
03:24:56.630 --> 03:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
little card he was never turned
 
03:25:00.070 --> 03:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
away okay so we're not talking
 
03:25:03.309 --> 03:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
about hard-hearted people or and there
 
03:25:06.150 --> 03:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
was a time when one person said we've
 
03:25:07.950 --> 03:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
got a bunch of stuff piled in the
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
bathroom just be really careful that you
 
03:25:13.110 --> 03:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't knock anything over over or
 
03:25:17.389 --> 03:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
whatever it was very much open and I'm
 
03:25:20.030 --> 03:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
assuming I'm hoping that we have a
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
witness here today who can explain maybe
 
03:25:24.830 --> 03:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
better to people what that situation is
 
03:25:29.870 --> 03:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
like um so you haven't seen the UAA card
 
03:25:32.429 --> 03:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
I I haven't I did a lot of research I uh
 
03:25:34.469 --> 03:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
the PDF that I sent you has some
 
03:25:37.229 --> 03:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
information like that in it I said it on
 
03:25:41.830 --> 03:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
Friday from my ledge email followup um
 
03:25:44.429 --> 03:25:44.439 align:start position:0%
uh one thing that could be recommended
 
03:25:48.030 --> 03:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
is that an organization possibly like
 
03:25:51.950 --> 03:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
UAA could Supply doctor's office with a
 
03:25:53.790 --> 03:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
supply of these cards and the doctor can
 
03:25:56.110 --> 03:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
just hand it to their patient and say
 
03:25:58.670 --> 03:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
use this that's a great idea that is a
 
03:26:01.229 --> 03:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
really great idea thank you
 
03:26:01.239 --> 03:26:03.150 align:start position:0%
really great idea thank you
representative

03:26:03.150 --> 03:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:26:05.349 --> 03:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman and also
 
03:26:07.550 --> 03:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank re for taking my question I'm sort
 
03:26:10.309 --> 03:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
of nitpicking here but one of the things
 
03:26:12.189 --> 03:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
that I'm always thinking about is how
 
03:26:13.910 --> 03:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
something could be abused by the parties
 
03:26:16.750 --> 03:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
that don't intend to do it appropriately
 
03:26:18.630 --> 03:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
like the people with the handicap
 
03:26:23.590 --> 03:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
stickers that President refer to online
 
03:26:27.150 --> 03:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
if you look at it 26 a National
 
03:26:30.269 --> 03:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
Association so if I have a card from my
 
03:26:33.150 --> 03:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy Association does that
 
03:26:35.950 --> 03:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
qualify if your Pharmacy Association is
 
03:26:38.910 --> 03:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
being used for a a Crohn's visit but
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is the law being what
 
03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
what's written here it doesn't say that
 
03:26:45.710 --> 03:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm just saying that possibly to
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
minimize abuse of it could we change or
 
03:26:50.590 --> 03:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
clarify that the nation Association has
 
03:26:51.710 --> 03:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
to come from some sort of an
 
03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
organization that we're referring to yes
 
03:26:56.229 --> 03:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
this is very yeah this is very nebulous
 
03:26:58.590 --> 03:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
it gives it yeah specific would be
 
03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:01.309 align:start position:0%

thank you for bringing this bill
 
03:27:38.590 --> 03:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
forward uh as mentioned I do live in
 
03:27:40.030 --> 03:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
Bedford I'm glad to see one of my
 
03:27:42.110 --> 03:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
Representatives here today as well as
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
own a small business in Rochester and I
 
03:27:47.229 --> 03:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
am here to support this bill I do live
 
03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
with crohn's disease and an osty device
 
03:27:52.830 --> 03:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
so I am very familiar with the incidents
 
03:27:56.269 --> 03:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
that can happen um to Simply put it
 
03:27:57.910 --> 03:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people soiling
 
03:28:01.349 --> 03:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
themselves and let's say it's tough to
 
03:28:03.070 --> 03:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
talk about I'm nervous here talking
 
03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
about it because implicitly I'm
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
admitting that I did it as well the
 
03:28:10.070 --> 03:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
problem is is that there's a nonzero
 
03:28:12.030 --> 03:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that prohibit
 
03:28:13.950 --> 03:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
people from using the bathroom in these
 
03:28:15.550 --> 03:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
moments of need and when I say a moment
 
03:28:18.830 --> 03:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
of need you're talking four 5 seconds
 
03:28:21.670 --> 03:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
from the moment that the urge hits to
 
03:28:21.680 --> 03:28:23.429 align:start position:0%
from the moment that the urge hits to
accidents

03:28:23.429 --> 03:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
accidents
 
03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
happen as a patient and an individual
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
that lives with this I know that for
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
many this is talking about or this is
 
03:28:32.110 --> 03:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
forcing us to make a decision to leave
 
03:28:34.030 --> 03:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
the house during the day to go to work
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
to shop to be a member of society
 
03:28:40.429 --> 03:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
removing some of that uncertainty is a
 
03:28:42.950 --> 03:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
huge load off of our shoulders and
 
03:28:46.510 --> 03:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
allows us to be part of life outside of
 
03:28:46.520 --> 03:28:47.710 align:start position:0%
allows us to be part of life outside of
the

03:28:47.710 --> 03:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:50.269 --> 03:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
home it's uh I think it was pointed out
 
03:28:51.910 --> 03:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
that there's 18 states that already have
 
03:28:53.710 --> 03:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
a version of what's called Alley's law
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
in place uh I hope New Hampshire is the
 
03:28:59.550 --> 03:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
19th um and again I just ask for
 
03:29:01.590 --> 03:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
consideration of this bill it really is
 
03:29:04.309 --> 03:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
low impact to the businesses and I
 
03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
understand the concerns around abuse and
 
03:29:07.830 --> 03:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
I hope the committee can find the right
 
03:29:10.269 --> 03:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
amendments to uh make this work and pass
 
03:29:12.389 --> 03:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
it quickly thank you very much thank you
 
03:29:13.990 --> 03:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
would you take a question if we have any
 
03:29:16.030 --> 03:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
oh yes absolutely let's have
 
03:29:16.040 --> 03:29:17.870 align:start position:0%
oh yes absolutely let's have
one

03:29:17.870 --> 03:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:29:21.790 --> 03:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
no all right yes thank you thank you for
 
03:29:23.469 --> 03:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question and I'll make it very
 
03:29:25.870 --> 03:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
brief have you seen any of these cards
 
03:29:28.510 --> 03:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
do you have a suggestion on who would
 
03:29:31.389 --> 03:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
issue the card uh would it be a your
 
03:29:34.070 --> 03:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
provider uh and could we have a
 
03:29:36.229 --> 03:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
universal one that everybody would just
 
03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
download the form I know that the
 
03:29:40.229 --> 03:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
Crohn's cus Foundation of America the
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
ccfa they they have a example card on
 
03:29:46.429 --> 03:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
their website um they they promote it as
 
03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
a you know maybe your state doesn't have
 
03:29:49.870 --> 03:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
the law but use this card and as was
 
03:29:51.790 --> 03:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
pointed out by the representative is
 
03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
that there's very few places that say no
 
03:29:57.790 --> 03:29:57.800 align:start position:0%

guys's attention to this kit I have with
 
03:31:24.189 --> 03:31:24.199 align:start position:0%

03:31:28.110 --> 03:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
bin it's lined with grocery bags and

03:31:30.830 --> 03:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:31:33.309 --> 03:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
clothes if you had told me two years ago
 
03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
that 3 million Americans that are grown
 
03:31:38.349 --> 03:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
adults carry this in their car I would
 
03:31:39.870 --> 03:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
have thought it was the grossest thing
 
03:31:42.950 --> 03:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
I've ever heard but unfortunately it's a
 
03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
reality for us
 
03:31:49.349 --> 03:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
um in February of 2021 I had my daughter
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
Beverly after a healthy and uneventful
 
03:31:54.590 --> 03:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy birth triggered some weird
 
03:31:56.110 --> 03:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
symptoms that I had never experienced
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
before and after many tests and Labs I
 
03:31:59.630 --> 03:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
had I was diagnosed with crohn's disease
 
03:32:02.150 --> 03:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
in May it's been almost a year since my
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and I have still not found an
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
effective medication meaning that I have
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
been in a constant state of moderate to
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
severe flare since my daughter was born
 
03:32:12.990 --> 03:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
my affects my daily life severely on
 
03:32:14.910 --> 03:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
average I use the bathroom R 19 times
 
03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
during the day and five times at night
 
03:32:20.269 --> 03:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
every single instance and I mean every
 
03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
instance of me needing to use the
 
03:32:24.150 --> 03:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
restroom is sudden and Urgent giving me
 
03:32:26.429 --> 03:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
an average of only 90 seconds to make it
 
03:32:30.110 --> 03:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
to a bathroom and yes I have timed it if
 
03:32:32.030 --> 03:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
that 90 seconds elapses and I not yet
 
03:32:33.750 --> 03:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
made it to the restroom I lose control
 
03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
of my body and end up having an accident
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
these episodes are typically referred to
 
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
by as Crohn's attacks they leave me
 
03:32:42.790 --> 03:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
unable to feed my
 
03:32:45.070 --> 03:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
daughter unable to read her a book
 
03:32:47.950 --> 03:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
before bed unable to attend meetings at
 
03:32:49.710 --> 03:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
work and most importantly for this
 
03:32:52.469 --> 03:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
meeting unable to run any errands or go
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
anywhere in my community unless I know
 
03:32:55.990 --> 03:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
that there will be a bathroom
 
03:32:58.389 --> 03:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
available this is because every time I
 
03:33:00.790 --> 03:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
or one of the other 3 million Americans
 
03:33:02.910 --> 03:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with IBD experience a Crohn's
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
attack and don't have access to a
 
03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
restroom we rely on this and risk being
 
03:33:11.670 --> 03:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
arrested in charged with indecent
 
03:33:13.790 --> 03:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
exposure when we
 
03:33:16.550 --> 03:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
do in July of last year I was shopping
 
03:33:18.150 --> 03:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
in a small boutique with my sister when
 
03:33:20.670 --> 03:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
I experienced a Crohn's attack I quickly
 
03:33:22.110 --> 03:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
tried to go into the restroom in a
 
03:33:23.790 --> 03:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
corner between some scarves and some
 
03:33:26.110 --> 03:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
ponchos but it was locked when I
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
explained the situation in my diagnosis
 
03:33:29.710 --> 03:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
and asked the employee behind the cash
 
03:33:31.830 --> 03:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
register for the key I was told it was
 
03:33:34.590 --> 03:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
an employee only restroom desperate and
 
03:33:36.750 --> 03:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
not looking to engage in a confrontation
 
03:33:38.590 --> 03:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
I tried to rush out to my car but did
 
03:33:41.389 --> 03:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
not make it to the door human humiliated
 
03:33:43.469 --> 03:33:43.479 align:start position:0%
defeated and degraded I did research on
 
03:33:44.790 --> 03:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
what other people with crohn's do to
 
03:33:46.110 --> 03:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
solve this issue and that's when I
 
03:33:48.189 --> 03:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
learned about Ali's law or the restroom
 
03:33:48.199 --> 03:33:49.070 align:start position:0%
learned about Ali's law or the restroom
access

03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
access
 
03:33:51.309 --> 03:33:51.319 align:start position:0%
act it allows people with Crohns or
 
03:33:53.110 --> 03:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
similar diseases to present a card or
 
03:33:54.429 --> 03:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
doctor's note that would grant them
 
03:33:56.349 --> 03:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
access to employee only arrest rooms and
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here
 
03:34:00.269 --> 03:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
today I know that business owners would
 
03:34:01.830 --> 03:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
look at this request and think of it as
 
03:34:03.670 --> 03:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
not being a matter of disability access
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
or discrimination I've been told many
 
03:34:07.229 --> 03:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
times that if the bathroom isn't
 
03:34:09.150 --> 03:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
available to anyone then their belief is
 
03:34:10.990 --> 03:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
that it's not discrimination to Den it
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
to someone with a
 
03:34:14.870 --> 03:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
disability I don't know how to stress
 
03:34:16.590 --> 03:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
enough or to put into words convincing
 
03:34:17.990 --> 03:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
enough that restroom access for
 
03:34:20.150 --> 03:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities like mine
 
03:34:22.389 --> 03:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
is simply and unequivocally a matter of
 
03:34:22.399 --> 03:34:24.150 align:start position:0%
is simply and unequivocally a matter of
Equitable

03:34:24.150 --> 03:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
Equitable
 
03:34:26.269 --> 03:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
access I reached out to family and
 
03:34:27.710 --> 03:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
friends to try and come up with a good
 
03:34:29.710 --> 03:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
enough analogy and the best one offered
 
03:34:30.910 --> 03:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
was from my friend
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
Courtney Courtney suffers from a seizure
 
03:34:35.070 --> 03:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
disorder for which she has a service dog
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
named Sky her seizures are sudden and
 
03:34:39.309 --> 03:34:39.319 align:start position:0%
Urgent just as my Cron's attacks are
 
03:34:41.910 --> 03:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
sudden and urgent she is unable to walk
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
to a store next door drive down the road
 
03:34:45.550 --> 03:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
or go elsewhere to have her seizures
 
03:34:47.229 --> 03:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
just as I am unable to make it elsewhere
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
during a Crohn's
 
03:34:51.429 --> 03:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
attack Courtney is physically capable of
 
03:34:52.990 --> 03:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
walking into a store on her own to
 
03:34:54.550 --> 03:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
browse her shop and may not have a
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
seizure but the mere potential that she
 
03:34:58.030 --> 03:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
might have one means that she is legally
 
03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
entitled to have sky with her if
 
03:35:02.189 --> 03:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
Courtney were to approach a store and be
 
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
denied access with her service dog that
 
03:35:06.469 --> 03:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
store it effectively and legally become
 
03:35:09.229 --> 03:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
inaccessible to her simply because of
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
the potential for a medical event and
 
03:35:12.389 --> 03:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
the fact that she requires her dog to
 
03:35:15.189 --> 03:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
support her through that medical event
 
03:35:16.910 --> 03:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
similarly while I might be physically
 
03:35:18.309 --> 03:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
capable of walking into a store and
 
03:35:19.830 --> 03:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
shopping without incident the mere
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
potential that a Crohn's attack could
 
03:35:23.469 --> 03:35:23.479 align:start position:0%
occur and that would I not that I would
 
03:35:25.469 --> 03:35:25.479 align:start position:0%
not have time or the physical ability to
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
go elsewhere means that if a bathroom is
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
not available to me that business is
 
03:35:31.710 --> 03:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
effectively also not available to me as
 
03:35:33.790 --> 03:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
a direct result of my
 
03:35:35.469 --> 03:35:35.479 align:start position:0%
disability the Americans with
 
03:35:37.229 --> 03:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
Disabilities Act requires and urges
 
03:35:38.590 --> 03:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
businesses to make reasonable
 
03:35:40.630 --> 03:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
accommodations where possible for both
 
03:35:41.950 --> 03:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
employees and customers with
 
03:35:43.870 --> 03:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities so long as they do not
 
03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
result in an undue burden being that
 
03:35:48.110 --> 03:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
this bill does not require businesses to
 
03:35:49.950 --> 03:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
open their restrooms to all customers
 
03:35:51.269 --> 03:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
and that it makes exceptions for
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
instances where there might be a health
 
03:35:55.229 --> 03:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
or safety risk I do not see how the
 
03:35:56.590 --> 03:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
passing of this bill or the use of
 
03:35:58.309 --> 03:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
bathrooms by select customers with
 
03:36:00.189 --> 03:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
certain disabilities in supporting
 
03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
documentation could be considered an
 
03:36:04.590 --> 03:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
undue burden in fact I would argue that
 
03:36:06.630 --> 03:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
not granting restroom access will result
 
03:36:08.950 --> 03:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
in an undue burden for employees who
 
03:36:11.189 --> 03:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
will end up having to mop up access when
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
I or people like me are refused access
 
03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
to the restrooms and don't make it to
 
03:36:14.960 --> 03:36:16.030 align:start position:0%
to the restrooms and don't make it to
our

03:36:16.030 --> 03:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:36:18.510 --> 03:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
cars this bill is a matter of Equitable
 
03:36:20.670 --> 03:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
access for those of us with bow related
 
03:36:22.670 --> 03:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities businesses that do not have
 
03:36:24.750 --> 03:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
restrooms available are just simply not
 
03:36:26.990 --> 03:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
available to us passage of this bill
 
03:36:28.229 --> 03:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
would allow people like me to
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
participate in our community and support
 
03:36:31.990 --> 03:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
small businesses without fear of
 
03:36:34.150 --> 03:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
embarrassment I urge the committee to
 
03:36:35.590 --> 03:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
empathize and put yourselves in our
 
03:36:38.110 --> 03:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
shoes no 28-year-old woman wants to
 
03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
admit to a cashier that we don't have
 
03:36:42.070 --> 03:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
control of our B ows no grown adult
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
wants to beg for a bathroom or admit
 
03:36:45.670 --> 03:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
that we're about to have an accident and
 
03:36:47.229 --> 03:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely nobody wants to use one of
 
03:36:49.110 --> 03:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
these in a parking
 
03:36:51.389 --> 03:36:51.399 align:start position:0%
lot but this is the reality of our
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
disability we do not have time to go
 
03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
next door and we do not have the
 
03:36:56.349 --> 03:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
physical ability to hold it we just
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
don't I sincerely hope that you're able
 
03:37:00.790 --> 03:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
to see the need for this bill we suffer
 
03:37:02.469 --> 03:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
so much in our daily lives the comfort
 
03:37:04.110 --> 03:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
of knowing we will be able to access the
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
restroom is such a small and simple act
 
03:37:08.070 --> 03:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
that requires almost nothing of business
 
03:37:09.910 --> 03:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
owners and allows people like me the
 
03:37:11.590 --> 03:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
ability to to leave productive
 
03:37:13.189 --> 03:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
fulfilling and enriched lives and
 
03:37:15.389 --> 03:37:15.399 align:start position:0%
interact with the community without fear
 
03:37:18.269 --> 03:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
of humiliation or degradation without
 
03:37:20.110 --> 03:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
bills like the restroom access act we
 
03:37:22.590 --> 03:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
are left with this as our option it's
 
03:37:24.510 --> 03:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
degrading it's disgusting it's
 
03:37:26.550 --> 03:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
dehumanizing and it's
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary thank you thank you so much
 
03:37:32.910 --> 03:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
for telling us your story representative
 
03:37:34.830 --> 03:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
kerk yes thank you for taking my
 
03:37:37.110 --> 03:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
question I'm curious given particularly
 
03:37:38.469 --> 03:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
what you just finished saying about the
 
03:37:40.630 --> 03:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
degrading aspect we've talked talked a
 
03:37:43.309 --> 03:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
little bit about various conditions um
 
03:37:45.550 --> 03:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering how you feel about
 
03:37:48.269 --> 03:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
would a whatever identification we have
 
03:37:49.830 --> 03:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
from the provider that says you should
 
03:37:53.070 --> 03:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
be allowed should it have a diagnosis or
 
03:37:54.870 --> 03:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
do you think that should be confidential
 
03:37:56.790 --> 03:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
and perhaps it should just use the
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
language which is on page 18 of the um
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
information that representative schmidth
 
03:38:04.349 --> 03:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
sent which they used the word restroom
 
03:38:06.269 --> 03:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
duress which covered a number of
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
different issues why somebody might wish
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
to do you think would you find it
 
03:38:12.550 --> 03:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
less offensive if you just had a card
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
said I should be granted immediate
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
access rather than saying I have Crohn's
 
03:38:18.389 --> 03:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
disease yes personally I would find that
 
03:38:21.550 --> 03:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
less offensive but I've also in my
 
03:38:23.429 --> 03:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
experience since having this disease
 
03:38:25.750 --> 03:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
learned that people don't really listen
 
03:38:28.990 --> 03:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
until you say Crohn's so and I guess it
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
would depend on um the person's
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
comfortability with talking about their
 
03:38:34.990 --> 03:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosis but I do think that the option
 
03:38:39.309 --> 03:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:39.319 --> 03:38:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
Weber

03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
03:38:42.750 --> 03:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
you may not be the right person to ask
 
03:38:44.269 --> 03:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
this but you were the one requesting the
 
03:38:45.950 --> 03:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm going to ask you anyway if
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate just let me know um
 
03:38:51.630 --> 03:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
is is this Michigan's law specifically
 
03:38:55.550 --> 03:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
and if you know are there have the
 
03:38:58.469 --> 03:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
states that passed the law passed
 
03:39:02.070 --> 03:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
exactly the same language or are there
 
03:39:04.910 --> 03:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
modifications in the various States no I
 
03:39:07.309 --> 03:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
believe there are modifications um for
 
03:39:09.070 --> 03:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
example I know that Massachusetts has
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
this law and I work in Mass it so I have
 
03:39:13.710 --> 03:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
looked up what their law is and they
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
have more of a fine system where it's
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
like the first um offense they find a
 
03:39:19.710 --> 03:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
certain amount and then the second
 
03:39:22.750 --> 03:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
offense they find more um so I know how
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
that's different in Massachusetts I
 
03:39:26.110 --> 03:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily know how it's
 
03:39:29.590 --> 03:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
different in Michigan other than that my
 
03:39:31.469 --> 03:39:31.479 align:start position:0%
uh my manager had Crohn's disease so she
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
was familiar with the law so when she's
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
the one who trained in place that we
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
were required to um to give access for
 
03:39:37.840 --> 03:39:38.590 align:start position:0%
were required to um to give access for
these

03:39:38.590 --> 03:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:39:42.990 --> 03:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:01.990 --> 03:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
you I think that that would be very
 
03:40:04.710 --> 03:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
helpful it's my experience in Mich being
 
03:40:07.590 --> 03:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
in Michigan when I go home that many
 
03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
business owners don't even know this law
 
03:40:11.670 --> 03:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
exists and you almost end up having to
 
03:40:14.229 --> 03:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
argue with them which kind of wastes the
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
time when you're trying to rush to the
 
03:40:18.830 --> 03:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
bathroom so I think that that would be
 
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
helpful in making business owners aware
 
03:40:22.229 --> 03:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
that this is a lawn that they could be
 
03:40:23.910 --> 03:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
fined because I certainly don't want
 
03:40:26.510 --> 03:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
anyone to be fined for not knowing but I
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
still want everyone with in New
 
03:40:31.469 --> 03:40:31.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with crohn's or any other
 
03:40:34.389 --> 03:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
disability like this to have access so
 
03:40:37.229 --> 03:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
um I think that something that would
 
03:40:39.389 --> 03:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
make business owners aware and their um
 
03:40:41.309 --> 03:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
staff aware would be really helpful in
 
03:40:42.510 --> 03:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
the sense that it would prevent more
 
03:40:44.110 --> 03:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
people from having to have accidents
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
explain thank you for your testimony did
 
03:40:53.389 --> 03:40:53.399 align:start position:0%
she have questions about the card I'm
 
03:40:56.750 --> 03:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
sorry did I see a hand no I didn't see a
 
03:41:00.590 --> 03:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
hand oh sorry okay you can have an a
 
03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
fellowship after okay yeah that' be good
 
03:41:04.870 --> 03:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
no I would would like to ask oh you
 
03:41:08.950 --> 03:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
would question um is there any kind of U
 
03:41:11.950 --> 03:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
sign like you said to put the sign would
 
03:41:14.030 --> 03:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
you like to put that in there to
 
03:41:16.110 --> 03:41:16.120 align:start position:0%
encourage I don't know how to write it
 
03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
either but uh some kind of sign not so
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
that people would would become
 
03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
recognized you know that's the bathroom
 
03:41:29.389 --> 03:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
law and uh that uh it's okay to let
 
03:41:32.349 --> 03:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
people do it and then you could have the
 
03:41:35.269 --> 03:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
conditions as part of the education yes
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:40.630 align:start position:0%
 
helpful

03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
03:41:43.189 --> 03:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and that concludes
 
03:41:46.590 --> 03:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
the last pink card we had and I would
 
03:41:49.229 --> 03:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
just say before closing the hearing this
 
03:41:51.349 --> 03:41:51.359 align:start position:0%

of stuff we need to have it fairly
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
soon with that
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
I ask just a quick question of what
 
03:42:05.950 --> 03:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
committee it might be going to after
 
03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%

03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:41.830 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams who's right
here

03:42:41.830 --> 03:42:41.840 align:start position:0%

03:42:45.349 --> 03:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chair peon um it's a
 
03:42:46.429 --> 03:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be in front of you
 
03:42:48.510 --> 03:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues um and I'm looking forward to
 
03:42:50.670 --> 03:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill uh I'm just going
 
03:42:52.429 --> 03:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
to give you a little bit of background
 
03:42:56.710 --> 03:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
on uh child care and the ongoing
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
saga uh first of all there was a
 
03:43:03.790 --> 03:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh there was a study committee in
 
03:43:07.269 --> 03:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
2019 uh to look into issues with child
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
care businesses and how we can better
 
03:43:11.229 --> 03:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
smooth the rails for child care
 
03:43:13.710 --> 03:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
businesses to succeed in New Hampshire
 
03:43:16.510 --> 03:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
um so I got the bill passed in Spring
 
03:43:18.790 --> 03:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
2019 and then I chaired the committee to
 
03:43:21.469 --> 03:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
study issues and impediments to starting
 
03:43:23.910 --> 03:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
running and growing Home and Commercial
 
03:43:26.309 --> 03:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
daycare facilities in New Hampshire so
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I am a mom of three I
 
03:43:30.189 --> 03:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
have four-year-old twins who are
 
03:43:32.070 --> 03:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
currently in a daycare and I have a
 
03:43:33.710 --> 03:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
one-year-old that I'm not quite ready to
 
03:43:36.510 --> 03:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
send to daycare but I will be soon uh so
 
03:43:38.349 --> 03:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
I am personally invested in making sure
 
03:43:39.910 --> 03:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
that we have adequate daycare for
 
03:43:42.030 --> 03:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire and also
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways to get rid of
 
03:43:45.469 --> 03:43:45.479 align:start position:0%
impediments that seem to be making it
 
03:43:47.229 --> 03:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
harder to run that kind of a business in
 
03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um so I've emailed the
 
03:43:51.630 --> 03:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
entire committee um the findings from
 
03:43:54.110 --> 03:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
that study committee that happened in
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
2019 um just sort of on background and
 
03:43:59.309 --> 03:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
so some of the things that we heard from
 
03:44:03.389 --> 03:44:03.399 align:start position:0%
different uh operators of facilities um
 
03:44:05.670 --> 03:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
included uh feeling as though there was
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
not a a sense of fairness when you are
 
03:44:11.189 --> 03:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
operating a facility and the state comes
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
in to do a surprise inspection which
 
03:44:15.510 --> 03:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
they do once a year and you get quote
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
unquote written up um and then you have
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
to deal with that do what it is what is
 
03:44:23.790 --> 03:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
required there are many different ways
 
03:44:25.550 --> 03:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
that you can uh respond to being written
 
03:44:27.910 --> 03:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
up uh but let's just say that there was
 
03:44:29.950 --> 03:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
something bad and it's not bad enough to
 
03:44:31.389 --> 03:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
close your facility but it's a black
 
03:44:33.790 --> 03:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
mark on your record and so that is
 
03:44:37.630 --> 03:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
published on the State website um and so
 
03:44:39.790 --> 03:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
for some facilities who had been in
 
03:44:43.469 --> 03:44:43.479 align:start position:0%
business for say 20 years having a black
 
03:44:46.630 --> 03:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
mark on your record from 19 years ago
 
03:44:49.510 --> 03:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
still shows up on the State website um
 
03:44:51.550 --> 03:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
and that could be construed against you
 
03:44:53.870 --> 03:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
as the person who was responsible for
 
03:44:56.550 --> 03:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
that is probably long gone the child or
 
03:44:57.870 --> 03:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
if there was a child involved in that
 
03:45:01.229 --> 03:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
incident is now in high school uh and so
 
03:45:03.269 --> 03:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know things change but having a
 
03:45:05.030 --> 03:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
permanent published record that the
 
03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
public can see can actually move against
 
03:45:09.750 --> 03:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
and be used against a business that has
 
03:45:12.389 --> 03:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
successfully operated for 20 years and
 
03:45:14.870 --> 03:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
so also just as a side note we do have
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
um Child Care Facilities that are often
 
03:45:20.110 --> 03:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh rebranded or started over with the
 
03:45:22.389 --> 03:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
same people under a different name and
 
03:45:23.750 --> 03:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
so it seemed like that was kind of
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
unfair to to allow a facility that
 
03:45:28.189 --> 03:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
gotten written up or even was forced to
 
03:45:30.670 --> 03:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
close and then rebranded and has this
 
03:45:32.950 --> 03:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
Sterling reputation of the last year but
 
03:45:34.590 --> 03:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
the reality is they had a bit of a
 
03:45:37.070 --> 03:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
history um so that all of this is just
 
03:45:39.149 --> 03:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
to summarize uh testimony that we heard
 
03:45:40.870 --> 03:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
from different Child Care Facility
 
03:45:44.189 --> 03:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
operators uh so in response to that um
 
03:45:46.389 --> 03:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
i' I've put language in this bill very
 
03:45:50.030 --> 03:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
specifically to say that um the intent
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
the let me find the exact language here
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
end of paragraph Roman numeral 2 line
 
03:46:01.389 --> 03:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
n uh it shall be available on the
 
03:46:03.990 --> 03:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
website for a period of three years and
 
03:46:06.070 --> 03:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
so that kind of gets rid of this tail
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
concern that bad information could be up
 
03:46:11.070 --> 03:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
there from 15 20 years ago that could
 
03:46:13.070 --> 03:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
reflect poorly on a facility when that's
 
03:46:15.309 --> 03:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
long long ago been addressed um in
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
addition there were also some concerns
 
03:46:19.309 --> 03:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
by Child Care Facility operators that
 
03:46:20.990 --> 03:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
when you do get written up um there
 
03:46:22.830 --> 03:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
really didn't seem to be a fair way for
 
03:46:25.389 --> 03:46:25.399 align:start position:0%
that to be delivered to the daycare
 
03:46:28.269 --> 03:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
operator you didn't get an email uh you
 
03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
may not even get a formal US mail
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
envelope or if you did receive that
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
which was not always the case you
 
03:46:36.269 --> 03:46:36.279 align:start position:0%
received that after your write up had
 
03:46:37.870 --> 03:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
already been published on the State
 
03:46:39.950 --> 03:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
website so there was really really no
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to respond to the write up
 
03:46:43.910 --> 03:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
or perhaps say this may be a
 
03:46:45.990 --> 03:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding I'd like to appeal your
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
findings um so it just seemed like it
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
was very much heavy-handed and one
 
03:46:53.309 --> 03:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
directional and so the intention of um
 
03:46:55.990 --> 03:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
let's see let me go down here section
 
03:46:57.870 --> 03:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
three of the bill is really that the
 
03:47:00.790 --> 03:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
department provide notice by email or if
 
03:47:03.429 --> 03:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
they don't have an email address US mail
 
03:47:06.349 --> 03:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
and that needs to go out um so that
 
03:47:08.469 --> 03:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to respond to
 
03:47:10.710 --> 03:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
that and that the response can then be
 
03:47:13.030 --> 03:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
published as well on the State website
 
03:47:14.710 --> 03:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
depending on what the infraction was
 
03:47:16.349 --> 03:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
obviously some infractions there may not
 
03:47:19.030 --> 03:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
be a response but but some there may and
 
03:47:20.670 --> 03:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
so that's at least giving an opportunity
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
for a rebuttal when the public is
 
03:47:23.710 --> 03:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
looking at and comparing different
 
03:47:25.790 --> 03:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
daycare facilities they can say okay
 
03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
well it looks like this one has four
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
infractions but they responded to them
 
03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
and it looks like things were addressed
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
this one has four infractions they have
 
03:47:34.870 --> 03:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
provided no response oo I don't know how
 
03:47:36.910 --> 03:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
I feel about that so really what we're
 
03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
trying to do is even the playing field
 
03:47:40.990 --> 03:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
and also be equal to every single child
 
03:47:42.750 --> 03:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
care facility that gets a write up
 
03:47:44.429 --> 03:47:44.439 align:start position:0%
giving them an opportunity for a
 
03:47:46.349 --> 03:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
response if they choose to take it and
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
also making sure that they receive the
 
03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
findings before it's published to the
 
03:47:51.349 --> 03:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
public without feeling as though they
 
03:47:53.469 --> 03:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
have a recourse and so I'm hoping that
 
03:47:55.189 --> 03:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
I've summarized sort of the history and
 
03:47:57.429 --> 03:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
what we've heard in prior testimony I'm
 
03:47:58.670 --> 03:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
sure there are probably some folks
 
03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
behind me who'd like to testify about
 
03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
this but I'm just carrying the water to
 
03:48:04.149 --> 03:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
hope that we can push this through um it
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
was very much a bipartisan effort to do
 
03:48:08.830 --> 03:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
the study committee and I'm hoping that
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
we can have a bipartisan effort to get a
 
03:48:12.429 --> 03:48:12.439 align:start position:0%
yes vote out of committee for this and I
 
03:48:14.429 --> 03:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time happy to answer
 
03:48:17.950 --> 03:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:48:20.429 --> 03:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:48:22.349 --> 03:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
you for bringing this bill and trying to
 
03:48:24.990 --> 03:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of daycare available
 
03:48:27.790 --> 03:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
um is there an appeal process when
 
03:48:31.830 --> 03:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
someone is um alleged to have an
 
03:48:35.070 --> 03:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
infraction um there is but we're
 
03:48:37.110 --> 03:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
currently working to address that
 
03:48:40.110 --> 03:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
because the appeal process um
 
03:48:41.950 --> 03:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell the way the appeal process
 
03:48:44.349 --> 03:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
works right now is you have someone from
 
03:48:46.269 --> 03:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
the the department comes and does a
 
03:48:48.910 --> 03:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
surprise inspection at your facility and
 
03:48:51.149 --> 03:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
then you say oh well that write up was
 
03:48:53.469 --> 03:48:53.479 align:start position:0%
wrong because you you end up appealing
 
03:48:56.030 --> 03:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
to the person who did the write up and
 
03:48:58.189 --> 03:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
their supervisor so it kind of feels
 
03:48:59.630 --> 03:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
like the deck is stacked against you to
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
do the appeal and then there is no
 
03:49:04.030 --> 03:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
higher authority right now to try to
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
overturn what tends to be a rubber stamp
 
03:49:07.950 --> 03:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
decision by the person who did the write
 
03:49:10.110 --> 03:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
up in their boss so we're looking at
 
03:49:12.309 --> 03:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
other Industries um specifically real
 
03:49:14.550 --> 03:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
estate uh to figure out if there's a way
 
03:49:16.830 --> 03:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
that we can do something more fair for
 
03:49:18.670 --> 03:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
the appeals process but that's not
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
specifically addressed in this Bill
 
03:49:24.510 --> 03:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Woods
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:49:30.349 --> 03:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question um it uh refers in
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
line n elsewhere about available on the
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
website for a period of three years does
 
03:49:38.429 --> 03:49:38.439 align:start position:0%
that mean that it is expunged after that
 
03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
time so the intention is that the record
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
always exists at the department but not
 
03:49:45.910 --> 03:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily on the website okay so in
 
03:49:48.149 --> 03:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
other words if I were investigating say
 
03:49:49.870 --> 03:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
I've got a child and I want to S it and
 
03:49:52.149 --> 03:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
I I've heard some things but the website
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
looks pretty clean I still have access
 
03:49:58.269 --> 03:49:58.279 align:start position:0%
to this and it's a permanent record it
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
is a permanent record at the department
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily on the Department's
 
03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
website is that stated followup Mr chair
 
03:50:08.710 --> 03:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
yes uh is is that stated clearly on the
 
03:50:08.720 --> 03:50:09.830 align:start position:0%
yes uh is is that stated clearly on the
website

03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
website
 
03:50:12.910 --> 03:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
that uh this is just the last three
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
years there may be other information so
 
03:50:18.389 --> 03:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
the people don't get the impression that
 
03:50:20.510 --> 03:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
if this is clear well I'm well there's
 
03:50:22.189 --> 03:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
nothing there it sounds like you're
 
03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
proposing a bill Amendment well I'm just
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
know I'm just inquiring in the mechanism
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
the website right now doesn't say
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
anything about that because the website
 
03:50:32.189 --> 03:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
has that 20 years or more of History so
 
03:50:34.110 --> 03:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
in order to change it there might be a
 
03:50:36.309 --> 03:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
little asterisk to say records are
 
03:50:37.710 --> 03:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
provided for the past three years for
 
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
additional information contact the
 
03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
department Department yeah okay so that
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
would need to happen happy to talk about
 
03:50:45.630 --> 03:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
our Amendment somebody in the audience
 
03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
is Raising her hand with authority so I
 
03:50:57.550 --> 03:50:57.560 align:start position:0%

F three to five years on our current
 
03:51:38.750 --> 03:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
website without this legislation Thank
 
03:51:42.149 --> 03:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
you very much representative
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman and also
 
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
03:51:50.710 --> 03:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
question can you or
 
03:51:52.950 --> 03:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
someone help me understand are
 
03:51:56.950 --> 03:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
inspections done routinely randomized or
 
03:51:59.309 --> 03:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
by complaint and could Mr chairman kind
 
03:52:01.389 --> 03:52:01.399 align:start position:0%
have a follow question for that
 
03:52:03.710 --> 03:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
answer my understanding based on
 
03:52:05.670 --> 03:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that I received is that they
 
03:52:08.469 --> 03:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
are random annual inspections there is
 
03:52:10.870 --> 03:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
no prior notice but they happen once a
 
03:52:13.429 --> 03:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
year so any day could be an inspection
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
day at a daycare facility Mr chair if I
 
03:52:19.750 --> 03:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
can follow up thank you now if they have
 
03:52:21.910 --> 03:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-up inspection and during that
 
03:52:24.110 --> 03:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
inspection it's determined that the
 
03:52:25.830 --> 03:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
facility addressed the infraction that
 
03:52:28.469 --> 03:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
was cited before do they have to wait a
 
03:52:30.149 --> 03:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
full three years why could that not be
 
03:52:33.070 --> 03:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
taken down off the website that is not a
 
03:52:34.870 --> 03:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
question for me unfortunately I don't
 
03:52:37.070 --> 03:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
have a response to that question
 
03:52:39.790 --> 03:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
representative kerk thank you
 
03:52:42.070 --> 03:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
um yes I actually have two prong
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
question here one is you commented about
 
03:52:46.670 --> 03:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of conceivably somebody
 
03:52:48.389 --> 03:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
going out of business rebranding and
 
03:52:50.590 --> 03:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
reopening should there be a cross
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
reference to the either the owner or the
 
03:52:55.990 --> 03:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
operator of the facility such that if
 
03:52:57.990 --> 03:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
they just change a name that information
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
could still be found under that person's
 
03:53:03.189 --> 03:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
name and well actually I do have a short
 
03:53:06.510 --> 03:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
question after that but thoughts on that
 
03:53:08.030 --> 03:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
in the interest of safety I think that
 
03:53:10.269 --> 03:53:10.279 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense to follow an
 
03:53:12.389 --> 03:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
individual especially if it's the owner
 
03:53:14.429 --> 03:53:14.439 align:start position:0%
identified owner of the facility I'm
 
03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
just not sure about the implementation
 
03:53:16.080 --> 03:53:17.910 align:start position:0%
just not sure about the implementation
of

03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
that and the follow follow the followup
 
03:53:23.790 --> 03:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
is considering how slow the ponies are
 
03:53:25.870 --> 03:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
getting up to the North Country uh do
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
you think that the 15 days if somebody
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
does not have email which would probably
 
03:53:31.630 --> 03:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
be unusual but if they don't do you
 
03:53:33.309 --> 03:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
think the 15 days is a sufficient
 
03:53:37.590 --> 03:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
turnaround time for um snail
 
03:53:39.910 --> 03:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
mail so the the requirement is that it
 
03:53:43.630 --> 03:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be published on the 30th day so
 
03:53:46.070 --> 03:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
15 days for notice should give you two
 
03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
weeks in between even if it was 18 days
 
03:53:52.349 --> 03:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
or something uh but I would be open to
 
03:53:54.790 --> 03:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
extending those two time periods if it
 
03:53:57.389 --> 03:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
was really considered unrealistic for
 
03:54:00.229 --> 03:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
mail to get there within the 30-day and
 
03:54:04.630 --> 03:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
 
03:54:07.880 --> 03:54:10.149 align:start position:0%

I am here today to let everyone know
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
that as our representative has um
 
03:55:40.590 --> 03:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill has said we have
 
03:55:42.990 --> 03:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
worked very hard over the past several
 
03:55:45.990 --> 03:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
years on this bill and many other bills
 
03:55:49.110 --> 03:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
um and we are um certainly in support of
 
03:55:51.269 --> 03:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
this the one thing I would bring um the
 
03:55:54.910 --> 03:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
committee's attention to is line eight
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
it says 21 days we would only ask that
 
03:56:00.510 --> 03:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
to be consistent with line number 10 we
 
03:56:05.469 --> 03:56:05.479 align:start position:0%
add the word business between 21 and
 
03:56:08.790 --> 03:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
days I'm certainly um available to
 
03:56:10.630 --> 03:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
answer questions if you have any some of
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
the questions that were asked prior um I
 
03:56:15.110 --> 03:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
might be able to address if you still
 
03:56:20.469 --> 03:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:22.870 --> 03:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:56:26.349 --> 03:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh we began to
 
03:56:29.349 --> 03:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
get a little bit into the area of what
 
03:56:32.590 --> 03:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
happens when somebody has addressed an
 
03:56:37.229 --> 03:56:37.239 align:start position:0%
issue um and I'm so sorry this didn't go
 
03:56:39.389 --> 03:56:39.399 align:start position:0%
to the children and family law committee
 
03:56:41.229 --> 03:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
where the members probably already knew
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
all the answers to these questions but
 
03:56:48.149 --> 03:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh when somebody has a violation and
 
03:56:50.309 --> 03:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
they get notified of a
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
violation and it's something like
 
03:56:55.030 --> 03:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
something that has to be fixed or a
 
03:56:57.189 --> 03:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
position or something that has to be
 
03:57:00.110 --> 03:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
changed on the website does it merely
 
03:57:04.870 --> 03:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
note the violation or does it also note
 
03:57:07.910 --> 03:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
when the violation has been cleared up
 
03:57:10.229 --> 03:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for your question I'm so
 
03:57:11.950 --> 03:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
I guess an overview of the process would
 
03:57:14.070 --> 03:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
be very helpful to certain thank you um
 
03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
and I do think that's important to this
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
discussion and to this bill so um what
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
happens is we go out and um it was
 
03:57:23.389 --> 03:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned numerous times I think that
 
03:57:26.149 --> 03:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
our visits are unexpected unannounced
 
03:57:29.070 --> 03:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
and that is pursuant to law um and that
 
03:57:31.229 --> 03:57:31.239 align:start position:0%
is across the board from birth to end of
 
03:57:34.510 --> 03:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
life we are required to unexpectedly do
 
03:57:37.710 --> 03:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
at least one annual visit so that people
 
03:57:40.550 --> 03:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
um aren't ready for us except they're
 
03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
ready for us every day and um we also do
 
03:57:47.550 --> 03:57:47.560 align:start position:0%
complaint inspections investigations um
 
03:57:49.550 --> 03:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
when we receive complaints from the
 
03:57:52.389 --> 03:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
community um and what happens is through
 
03:57:54.790 --> 03:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
our investigatory process which can
 
03:57:58.710 --> 03:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
include on-site visits um telephone
 
03:58:04.110 --> 03:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
calls interviews documentation we um end
 
03:58:07.110 --> 03:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
with a report a statement of findings
 
03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
that is then delivered to the leny who
 
03:58:12.750 --> 03:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
is given 21 days to respond with a
 
03:58:15.389 --> 03:58:15.399 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan which is also
 
03:58:18.269 --> 03:58:18.279 align:start position:0%
posted online with the statement of
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
findings that corrective action plan
 
03:58:25.830 --> 03:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
specifies by the lensey by the program
 
03:58:29.670 --> 03:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
what their um what their feedback is
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
what the deficiency was how they're
 
03:58:33.790 --> 03:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
going to fix it when they fixed it um
 
03:58:35.710 --> 03:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
and any other additional comments they
 
03:58:38.950 --> 03:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
might have should they um dispute a
 
03:58:41.590 --> 03:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
finding that we um that we found they
 
03:58:43.710 --> 03:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
have that right as well the only thing
 
03:58:45.790 --> 03:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
we ask is that people be respectful that
 
03:58:48.030 --> 03:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
it's a public website and ask them not
 
03:58:51.389 --> 03:58:51.399 align:start position:0%
to use inflammatory comments or um
 
03:58:54.070 --> 03:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
language that is not acceptable um but
 
03:58:56.870 --> 03:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
other than that that also gets posted so
 
03:58:59.030 --> 03:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
I think that answers your question
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank
 
03:59:06.269 --> 03:59:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:08.510 --> 03:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
03:59:10.750 --> 03:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
03:59:12.469 --> 03:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
asked this before to representative MC
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
Williams and the question was if the
 
03:59:19.389 --> 03:59:19.399 align:start position:0%
infraction has been resolved between
 
03:59:21.870 --> 03:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
inspections does it have to in your
 
03:59:24.229 --> 03:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
opinion remain On The Board website for
 
03:59:25.870 --> 03:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
the full three years or can it be taken
 
03:59:27.550 --> 03:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
down once the infraction has been
 
03:59:29.750 --> 03:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
resolved to the Department's
 
03:59:32.469 --> 03:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
satisfaction so um in my opinion it
 
03:59:35.309 --> 03:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
would require um RSA it would require
 
03:59:37.950 --> 03:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
change to the the law um legislation
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
requires us um in all in the adult world
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
and in the child care world to leave all
 
03:59:46.110 --> 03:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
statements of findings posted publicly
 
03:59:48.030 --> 03:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
for a period of I think in some areas
 
03:59:50.309 --> 03:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
it's five years it's three to five years
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
um however um you would be able to see
 
03:59:57.070 --> 03:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
as um a a consumer you would be able to
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
see in
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
2017 this citation occurred but in 2018
 
04:00:04.950 --> 04:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
19 and 20 it no longer occurred so you
 
04:00:09.189 --> 04:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
would know that it was fixed um or um
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
but I I mean I currently we are required
 
04:00:14.630 --> 04:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman H up so what I'm
 
04:00:21.550 --> 04:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
hearing I want to be clear about this it
 
04:00:24.429 --> 04:00:24.439 align:start position:0%
does require a change in the RSA and
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
would the department be supportive of
 
04:00:27.990 --> 04:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
such a change in the RSA would you work
 
04:00:29.309 --> 04:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
with us in trying to figure out how to
 
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
come up with some common
 
04:00:33.269 --> 04:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
ground I would certainly be supportive
 
04:00:35.469 --> 04:00:35.479 align:start position:0%
of working with you on that um along
 
04:00:39.510 --> 04:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
with our attorneys yes absolutely
 
04:00:39.520 --> 04:00:41.349 align:start position:0%
with our attorneys yes absolutely
representative

04:00:41.349 --> 04:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:44.189 --> 04:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:00:46.269 --> 04:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking this question I may have
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
misunderstood but it sounds like I heard
 
04:00:53.149 --> 04:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
that this bill specifies three years of
 
04:00:56.349 --> 04:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
a violation being on the website I also
 
04:00:59.950 --> 04:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that um sometimes
 
04:01:03.670 --> 04:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
violations remain for 17 years or 20
 
04:01:06.070 --> 04:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
years and then I heard you say that at
 
04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
most they're on the website for 3 to
 
04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
five years unless I'm mixing things up
 
04:01:12.870 --> 04:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
no I I think I heard the same and I'm
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
not sure I I couldn't speak to the
 
04:01:18.469 --> 04:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
Beyond five years um as um since I've
 
04:01:20.510 --> 04:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
been with the Department the law has
 
04:01:23.510 --> 04:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
required us to have for five years we
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
have with this legislation that has been
 
04:01:29.590 --> 04:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing for two years I think um we
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
updated our website already to show that
 
04:01:33.910 --> 04:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
if you needed and that was an answer to
 
04:01:36.269 --> 04:01:36.279 align:start position:0%
representative Wood's question that if
 
04:01:39.229 --> 04:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
in fact you wanted 20 years could you
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
get that yes you give us a call and we
 
04:01:42.870 --> 04:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
would get that for you because it is
 
04:01:44.550 --> 04:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
permanently on record right now if you
 
04:01:46.630 --> 04:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
were go to the childcare licensing it is
 
04:01:50.429 --> 04:01:50.439 align:start position:0%
five years of History um because that I
 
04:01:53.790 --> 04:01:53.800 align:start position:0%
believe is what the legislation says now
 
04:01:56.189 --> 04:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
but we are certainly open and willing to
 
04:01:57.550 --> 04:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
change to three years which we've
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
already noted on our website
 
04:02:04.389 --> 04:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
followup okay so you're so from what I'm
 
04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
gathering um it's currently things are
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
on there for 5 years and you're if the
 
04:02:12.590 --> 04:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
Law changes you're willing to make it
 
04:02:15.429 --> 04:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
three years absolutely but um I would
 
04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
ask of you as the expert um is there an
 
04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
advantage to it being three years or is
 
04:02:22.870 --> 04:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
or would something be lost if it wasn't
 
04:02:22.880 --> 04:02:24.950 align:start position:0%
or would something be lost if it wasn't
five

04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:02:24.960 --> 04:02:27.429 align:start position:0%
five
years

04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:02:30.950 --> 04:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that question and I
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
think as in my role now I don't see the
 
04:02:37.590 --> 04:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
difference between three years or five
 
04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
years if I were a
 
04:02:42.429 --> 04:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
parent I might think differently and
 
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
want 10 to 15 years but then I'd call me
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
and say Hey can I have the last 10 years
 
04:02:53.510 --> 04:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
um so it would depend on what my role
 
04:02:55.630 --> 04:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
was for the
 
04:02:58.389 --> 04:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
information does that help or do I still
 
04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
need to clarify
 
04:03:05.149 --> 04:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
that you may continue representative I
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
understand that um a cautious parent
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
might want more information and a
 
04:03:12.830 --> 04:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
daycare who's fixed the problem and
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't want bad PR to have a shorter
 
04:03:19.469 --> 04:03:19.479 align:start position:0%
time but I guess I'm asking you for your
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
opinion as someone who certainly has
 
04:03:25.110 --> 04:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
more expertise than myself maybe more
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
expertise than anyone in in the room um
 
04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
whether three years is a reasonable
 
04:03:32.269 --> 04:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
amount of time I think it
 
04:03:36.590 --> 04:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
is thank representative kerk yes just a
 
04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
quick question I'd asked this earlier
 
04:03:39.790 --> 04:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
but but since you know more about this
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
obviously uh would there be a way for
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
the Department to cross reference uh
 
04:03:45.469 --> 04:03:45.479 align:start position:0%
info regarding either owners or
 
04:03:47.830 --> 04:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
operators such that a bad actor couldn't
 
04:03:50.710 --> 04:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
just uh Rebrand or change the name of
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
the facility and still be just as bad a
 
04:03:54.510 --> 04:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
person is there a way to cross reference
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
that so um I wrote your question down
 
04:03:58.990 --> 04:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
your comment down because I think it's
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
very important and we see that in child
 
04:04:03.630 --> 04:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
care as well as in adult care we've seen
 
04:04:05.389 --> 04:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
that a lot in our nursing home
 
04:04:08.030 --> 04:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
facilities lately um and a lot of name
 
04:04:10.990 --> 04:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
changes so I noted that and I'm going to
 
04:04:12.469 --> 04:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
go back to the office and we're going to
 
04:04:14.149 --> 04:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
start that discussion because that
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen in our current
 
04:04:17.710 --> 04:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
environment but I think it's a really
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
great idea so thank you for bringing it
 
04:04:19.680 --> 04:04:20.750 align:start position:0%
great idea so thank you for bringing it
up

04:04:20.750 --> 04:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:04:22.750 --> 04:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
again would you be able to get back to
 
04:04:24.309 --> 04:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
us rapidly because we have to have an
 
04:04:26.550 --> 04:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
amendment we would want to be able to I
 
04:04:28.670 --> 04:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
mean no could it be done before we would
 
04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
put it in an amendment Define
 
04:04:34.990 --> 04:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
rapidly like by the end of this this is
 
04:04:38.149 --> 04:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
not an early bill so it is not so
 
04:04:39.870 --> 04:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
sometime in the next four weeks would be
 
04:04:43.269 --> 04:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful absolutely thank you any
 
04:04:46.429 --> 04:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
further questions for manager shley well
 
04:04:47.910 --> 04:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
this side of the aisle okay
 
04:04:50.349 --> 04:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
representative Acton thank
 
04:04:53.070 --> 04:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and um for the
 
04:04:55.469 --> 04:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
record I was on the study committee that
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
was mentioned by the sponsor and um so
 
04:05:02.189 --> 04:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh director shley I I
 
04:05:04.670 --> 04:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
recollect that when we did the study
 
04:05:06.550 --> 04:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee the um complaints stayed on
 
04:05:09.550 --> 04:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
the website at that point for a a very
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
long time and is one of the reasons why
 
04:05:14.790 --> 04:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
we did the the study committee so are
 
04:05:17.229 --> 04:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
you testifying that the length of time
 
04:05:20.349 --> 04:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
changed since then since we did the
 
04:05:20.359 --> 04:05:22.030 align:start position:0%
changed since then since we did the
study

04:05:22.030 --> 04:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee so I I'm going to you you
 
04:05:27.670 --> 04:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned complaints so maybe complaints
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
were handled differently than the annual
 
04:05:33.630 --> 04:05:33.640 align:start position:0%
monitoring visits I'm going to follow up
 
04:05:35.349 --> 04:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
on that question before the end of the
 
04:05:38.070 --> 04:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
week um I know that currently there's
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
only 5 years or on at least the two that
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
I just looked at in the galley um let me
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
confirm that to make sure and I'm sorry
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
if I
 
04:05:51.790 --> 04:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
misstated um actually follow up follow
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
up please yes okay
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:02.269 --> 04:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
that I guess would you believe that at
 
04:06:06.149 --> 04:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
the time the reason why we did the study
 
04:06:08.910 --> 04:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
committee was because we had had so many
 
04:06:10.830 --> 04:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
people from the industry complaining
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
about how long those things were on
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
there and that appears to have changed
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
since then so that's that's good but I
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to get the the time frame of
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
that and um uh one final followup chair
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
one one more um are you aware that after
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
we did the study committee we received
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
uh at least two complaints from Facility
 
04:06:32.750 --> 04:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
Owners who feel that they they got a
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
spot inspection within a several days of
 
04:06:36.870 --> 04:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
testifying and they felt it was done in
 
04:06:36.880 --> 04:06:38.309 align:start position:0%
testifying and they felt it was done in
retribution

04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
retribution
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
I believe that was brought up in the
 
04:06:43.950 --> 04:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
prior committee and I believe um that
 
04:06:45.510 --> 04:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
there's legislation going forward on
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
that I I I do want to say because I did
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
hear you know a comment over here um
 
04:06:53.790 --> 04:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
this has taken years of conversation and
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
I will agree with your comment there
 
04:07:00.309 --> 04:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
were a lot of challenges opportunities
 
04:07:02.590 --> 04:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
problems over the course of the last two
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
years and I am very happy to be able to
 
04:07:06.990 --> 04:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
sit here in front of this committee and
 
04:07:09.710 --> 04:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
let you know that there aren't a lot of
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
people out here behind me right from the
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
community feeling the same way they felt
 
04:07:18.030 --> 04:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
two years ago and I think that says a
 
04:07:21.710 --> 04:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
lot to the work that we've done together
 
04:07:24.910 --> 04:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot so yes were there
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
issues you bet um and I I I don't know
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
how I mean am I aware of that yes I am
 
04:07:35.910 --> 04:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
aware of that um do I believe that the
 
04:07:38.109 --> 04:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
people that thought that happened firmly
 
04:07:42.269 --> 04:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
believe that yes do we take that kind of
 
04:07:45.189 --> 04:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
if we investigate that internally with
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
our HR and if anyone in our department
 
04:07:51.990 --> 04:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
overall acts in any manner like that
 
04:07:54.429 --> 04:07:54.439 align:start position:0%
it's unacceptable and we would take
 
04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:03.389 --> 04:08:03.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much manager Shockley
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and I have no further
 
04:08:11.950 --> 04:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
pink cards so I will bring the hearing
 
04:08:13.830 --> 04:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%

various people who have brought us bills
 
04:08:51.429 --> 04:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
today that you are not planning on
 
04:08:53.349 --> 04:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
appointing a lot of subcommittees to
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
work on these bills is that correct I'm
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
taking them as they come if it sounds
 
04:09:02.469 --> 04:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
like the prime
 
04:09:02.479 --> 04:09:03.990 align:start position:0%
like the prime

hoc committee with people from us from
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
the committee here um I'd already spoken

with one representative about a bill
 
04:09:21.510 --> 04:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's coming up where I suspect we will
 
04:09:24.070 --> 04:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee okay so it's not a
 
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
blanket policy you're just sort of
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%

um this bill was brought to my attention
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
um through constituents seeking
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
essentially parity in what they
 
04:10:10.590 --> 04:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
experience in inperson medical
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
appointments um and for brevity um to
 
04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
explain sort of what I am am what the
 
04:10:19.630 --> 04:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
intent of the piece of legislation is is
 
04:10:22.429 --> 04:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
for example that when an individual who
 
04:10:24.670 --> 04:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
is limited English proficient deaf heart
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
of hearing needs an interpreter or
 
04:10:29.309 --> 04:10:29.319 align:start position:0%
translator at an in-person doctor's
 
04:10:31.309 --> 04:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
appointment they may request one in one
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
is provided to them free of charge that
 
04:10:36.510 --> 04:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
is in Statute in a federal law what we
 
04:10:38.429 --> 04:10:38.439 align:start position:0%
are asking for is is that individuals
 
04:10:40.030 --> 04:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
who are participating in teleah Health
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
Medicine have the same opportunity
 
04:10:44.590 --> 04:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
afforded to them so with that I'll take
 
04:10:44.600 --> 04:10:47.030 align:start position:0%
afforded to them so with that I'll take
any

04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions I have in my notes that the
 
04:10:52.109 --> 04:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
tele medicine is not in Federal
 
04:10:55.469 --> 04:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
Regulations now but but in person is
 
04:10:58.429 --> 04:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay that is correct and
 
04:11:00.750 --> 04:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
you said at no additional charge uh
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's in an additional charge to
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
somebody is it it's not to the patient
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
is it to the provider it uh that is
 
04:11:09.870 --> 04:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
actually a question that I cannot answer
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
maybe there's somebody in Insurance
 
04:11:16.710 --> 04:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
behind me or within DHHS who could um um
 
04:11:17.950 --> 04:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
we'll bring that person up when you're
 
04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
finished yeah thank you yeah no problem
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
um but to answer your question U Mr
 
04:11:26.910 --> 04:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
chair um it is in statute that it is not
 
04:11:33.309 --> 04:11:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:36.349 --> 04:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
patient any
 
04:11:36.359 --> 04:11:38.510 align:start position:0%
patient any
questions

04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:11:43.149 --> 04:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
we have a whole 40 minutes to think of
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
who's my goto always has a question
 
04:11:48.309 --> 04:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
person representa no I I get to do that
 
04:11:49.950 --> 04:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
that's because I have the big seat
 
04:11:49.960 --> 04:11:51.309 align:start position:0%
that's because I have the big seat
representative

04:11:51.309 --> 04:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
gay thank you thank you Mr chairman I
 
04:11:57.630 --> 04:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
was just wondering how it works uh do
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
you uh do you use um an internet
 
04:12:04.109 --> 04:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
connection to get a translator who can
 
04:12:06.950 --> 04:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
speak whatever you need that is
 
04:12:10.510 --> 04:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
something thing that I um often times
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
have seen even on current um platforms
 
04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
for telea Health Medicine there are
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
close captioning transcription down
 
04:12:19.149 --> 04:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
there for certain types of requests that
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
might be made I'm um but if they are
 
04:12:24.030 --> 04:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
specific in language or nature there's
 
04:12:25.950 --> 04:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
oftentimes um even in hospitals or
 
04:12:28.389 --> 04:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
doctor's offices there are translators
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
who you can call that speak specific
 
04:12:32.149 --> 04:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
languages who will come to the
 
04:12:34.389 --> 04:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
appointment and facilitate that
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
conversation or perhaps um then ALS also
 
04:12:40.189 --> 04:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
be present um
 
04:12:43.149 --> 04:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
virtually followup
 
04:12:45.990 --> 04:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
followup I I guess I'm shocked right now
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
thinking that you're supposed to that's
 
04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay question are you supposed to are
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
you supposed to you believe I'm in shock
 
04:12:58.149 --> 04:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
if well yeah do you mind um I guess I
 
04:13:00.950 --> 04:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
can understand that you can offer any
 
04:13:04.870 --> 04:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
language if you do it um through the
 
04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
internet and I you know I like using
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
translators myself but if you've got a
 
04:13:11.040 --> 04:13:12.269 align:start position:0%
translators myself but if you've got a
patient

04:13:12.269 --> 04:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:13:14.469 --> 04:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
there the
 
04:13:19.590 --> 04:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
idea are you gwi are you thinking that
 
04:13:23.630 --> 04:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
people should get a real live person who
 
04:13:28.910 --> 04:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
speaks Chinese or uh Tagalog or whatever
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
are you thinking they have to come
 
04:13:33.950 --> 04:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
physically to a an appointment if you
 
04:13:37.309 --> 04:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
know ahead or do just seems like like
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
tele medicine would not be hard to
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
provide the same service if you already
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
did it electronically uh if I'm
 
04:13:49.870 --> 04:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
following your question I I think um so
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
that that request is already made at a
 
04:13:54.429 --> 04:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
doctor's office or a hospital and I am
 
04:13:56.870 --> 04:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
not mandating or dictating how they get
 
04:14:00.189 --> 04:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
that translator there whether it is a
 
04:14:01.750 --> 04:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
person who is participating
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
telephonically to translate between the
 
04:14:06.750 --> 04:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
patient and the doctor or if that's some
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
other service that medical providers
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
have out there that is
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
already good to go um but what I am
 
04:14:16.950 --> 04:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
saying is that that request should be
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
met for individuals who have that need
 
04:14:22.429 --> 04:14:22.439 align:start position:0%
and are participating in teleah health
 
04:14:25.030 --> 04:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
medicine before we continue if there's
 
04:14:26.990 --> 04:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
anyone who is going to answer any of
 
04:14:27.000 --> 04:14:28.389 align:start position:0%
anyone who is going to answer any of
these

04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
questions who comes from a department or
 
04:14:33.790 --> 04:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
an agency I'd like to have a pink card
 
04:14:35.349 --> 04:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have the you don't get to
 
04:14:37.309 --> 04:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
keep the pink card I get the pink card
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you if there's any written
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
testimony please bring it up as
 
04:14:46.750 --> 04:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
well good representative
 
04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
Merchant if if I know that most healthc
 
04:14:53.710 --> 04:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
care facilities use telephonic
 
04:14:55.550 --> 04:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
translation so basically at that point
 
04:14:58.030 --> 04:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
in time gay my understanding is that
 
04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
they'll call a service and the service
 
04:15:02.469 --> 04:15:02.479 align:start position:0%
will have different people who speak
 
04:15:02.479 --> 04:15:03.670 align:start position:0%
will have different people who speak
different

04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:15:06.550 --> 04:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
languages connected by a phone so the
 
04:15:08.750 --> 04:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
patient is on one side provider on that
 
04:15:10.269 --> 04:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
side along with the translator on the
 
04:15:12.030 --> 04:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
other side to translate the conversation
 
04:15:13.389 --> 04:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
between the patient and the provider but
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
telephonically representative
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
Weber I think mine's been asked and
 
04:15:22.670 --> 04:15:22.680 align:start position:0%

04:15:44.590 --> 04:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
you be aware that the teleah health uh
 
04:15:48.109 --> 04:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
codes have been completely revamped they
 
04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
might be able to uh I think uh might
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
have addressed
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
that uh to answer your question I do
 
04:15:59.469 --> 04:15:59.479 align:start position:0%
know about the teleah Health commission
 
04:15:59.479 --> 04:16:00.309 align:start position:0%
know about the teleah Health commission
I

04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
I am not aware that that sponsor or
 
04:16:07.109 --> 04:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor was on the commission but
 
04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
there are others that are on the bill
 
04:16:11.469 --> 04:16:11.479 align:start position:0%
who are and so um we still think that
 
04:16:14.070 --> 04:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
this is something that should be in
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
statute um well thank and I'm speaking
 
04:16:19.389 --> 04:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
for myself no other member sorry
 
04:16:21.910 --> 04:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um I'm I'm
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
curious about the technical aspects of
 
04:16:30.070 --> 04:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
including an interpreter in a telea
 
04:16:32.670 --> 04:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
health visit are we talking about
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
somehow getting them into a one-on-one
 
04:16:37.229 --> 04:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
video chat that might be set up up is
 
04:16:39.670 --> 04:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
only a one on sorry setup is only a
 
04:16:42.030 --> 04:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
one-on-one thing for privacy issues are
 
04:16:44.830 --> 04:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
we talking about a party call how is
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
this technically going to be
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
accomplished or is this something where
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to say here's what you have
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
to do provider you have to solve this
 
04:16:52.680 --> 04:16:54.550 align:start position:0%
to do provider you have to solve this
issue

04:16:54.550 --> 04:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:16:57.309 --> 04:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
what so let me be very careful here
 
04:17:00.870 --> 04:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
because again I am not a provider I was
 
04:17:02.990 --> 04:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
brought this issue to a family who did
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
not English was not their first language
 
04:17:07.389 --> 04:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
and they were trying to facilitate
 
04:17:11.469 --> 04:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
an medical appointment and had um a
 
04:17:13.309 --> 04:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
younger relative trying to translate
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
very complicated medical things between
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
themselves and one another and I feel
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
like that is not an
 
04:17:20.720 --> 04:17:22.229 align:start position:0%
like that is not an
appropriate

04:17:22.229 --> 04:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
um opportunity and there's a huge leeway
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
and opportunity for there to be a
 
04:17:30.189 --> 04:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
miscommunication when it's not somebody
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
well versed in the medical community
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
medical knowledge and these telephonic
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
transcribers have that knowledge to be
 
04:17:38.870 --> 04:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
able able to translate accurately back
 
04:17:44.229 --> 04:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:48.269 --> 04:17:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.030 --> 04:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:54.510 --> 04:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
chairman this this is a question that's
 
04:17:58.710 --> 04:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
bothered me for a while uh with with
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
tele medicine or any other source
 
04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with Deen heart of
 
04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
hearing psychotherapy which is what I
 
04:18:08.750 --> 04:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
used to
 
04:18:12.349 --> 04:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
do is based on a relationship and the
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
development of a
 
04:18:16.349 --> 04:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
relationship one of the things that
 
04:18:18.389 --> 04:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
happened with a young fellow I was
 
04:18:21.309 --> 04:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
seeing was that the relationship was
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
developing with The
 
04:18:28.550 --> 04:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
Interpreter and not me and therefore the
 
04:18:32.309 --> 04:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
question of outcomes of service provided
 
04:18:35.309 --> 04:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
to information to the
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner perhaps should deal with
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
that issue because it made it extremely
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
difficult and U I had to stop The
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
Interpreter and try to do it by using
 
04:18:52.030 --> 04:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
notes back and forth and it really
 
04:18:56.349 --> 04:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
didn't work particularly well uh at all
 
04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
but that whole issue about Psychotherapy
 
04:19:01.510 --> 04:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
and the importance of the
 
04:19:04.469 --> 04:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
relationship uh is is is extremely
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
important when we're dealing with def
 
04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
heart of
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'd be interested to hearing
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:18.220 --> 04:19:18.230 align:start position:0%
subject is there a specific question
 
04:19:18.230 --> 04:19:19.550 align:start position:0%
subject is there a specific question
[Music]

04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:19:22.590 --> 04:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
around the intent of the legislation
 
04:19:24.189 --> 04:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
with a
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
translator is that what you're asking
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry well what what happens I
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
think at least what happened with me was
 
04:19:33.950 --> 04:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
the relationship that should be
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
developing with the therapist develop
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
with The Interpreter and the person is
 
04:19:42.349 --> 04:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
looking at that interpreter and the
 
04:19:45.870 --> 04:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
relationship is developing and I as the
 
04:19:48.189 --> 04:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
therapist who's trained to deal with
 
04:19:50.910 --> 04:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
this belong off to the
 
04:19:54.750 --> 04:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
side so that the therapy from my point
 
04:19:54.760 --> 04:19:55.670 align:start position:0%
side so that the therapy from my point
of

04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:19:59.309 --> 04:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
view did not work particularly
 
04:20:02.590 --> 04:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
well and uh some others maybe Joe or
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
some others have had this
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
experience but it's been something that
 
04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
has concerned me for quite a while and
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
now that I'm along with the chairman on
 
04:20:16.389 --> 04:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
the def Hut of hearing commission it's
 
04:20:16.399 --> 04:20:18.469 align:start position:0%
the def Hut of hearing commission it's
come

04:20:18.469 --> 04:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
come
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
back that's something to consider I do
 
04:20:23.830 --> 04:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
know that most transcribers and
 
04:20:25.870 --> 04:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
translators with respect to the depth in
 
04:20:27.950 --> 04:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
the heart of hearing are extremely
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
professional in their work and work
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
diligently to communicate the needs of
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
the patient with their whomever they're
 
04:20:36.750 --> 04:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
translating for whatever reason re
 
04:20:41.790 --> 04:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:49.750 --> 04:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chair I I don't
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
really have a question but I think I
 
04:20:55.070 --> 04:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
have an answer to an earlier question do
 
04:20:55.080 --> 04:20:56.750 align:start position:0%
have an answer to an earlier question do
I

04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:04.109 --> 04:21:04.119 align:start position:0%
if do you believe that I used to work as
 
04:21:07.149 --> 04:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
an administrator in a um Community
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Center and it was our
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide translation
 
04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
services and our responsibility to pay
 
04:21:17.790 --> 04:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
for them thank you I would believe
 
04:21:17.800 --> 04:21:25.710 align:start position:0%
for them thank you I would believe
[Laughter]

04:21:25.710 --> 04:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:30.910 --> 04:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:38.750 --> 04:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
you darene shley if you would come up
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
please you are not darene shley I know
 
04:21:44.950 --> 04:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
Daren shley you are not darene shley
 
04:21:53.149 --> 04:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:56.070 --> 04:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Pearson and committee
 
04:21:58.990 --> 04:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
members um uh chairman Pearson and
 
04:22:00.429 --> 04:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is John
 
04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
Williams I'm director of legislative
 
04:22:03.990 --> 04:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
affairs and we actually hadn't come here
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
today to be um ready to testify in this
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill because as a concept we're
 
04:22:10.830 --> 04:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
supportive of the bill that you see
 
04:22:13.710 --> 04:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
before you certainly it it genders the
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
thought of open communication uh with a
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
patient and trying to uh U to get over
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
any language barriers that could be
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
whether in person or intell health the
 
04:22:25.469 --> 04:22:25.479 align:start position:0%
only reason it has connection with the
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
department and very similar to that
 
04:22:29.309 --> 04:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
earlier piece of legislation today that
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
you heard that there was overlap between
 
04:22:32.349 --> 04:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and our
 
04:22:36.070 --> 04:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
agency is that it was um the um drafters
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
of this bill at the office of
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
legislative Services working with um
 
04:22:42.870 --> 04:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
represent Murray decided that um and I'm
 
04:22:44.510 --> 04:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
just speculating this based upon
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
placement because our agency this is not
 
04:22:49.229 --> 04:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
our requested Bill nor were we uh
 
04:22:50.830 --> 04:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
requested to be participating in the
 
04:22:52.269 --> 04:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
drafting of it but I'm speculating
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
because there's just so much work to do
 
04:22:56.189 --> 04:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
for all of us that the concept here was
 
04:22:58.469 --> 04:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
to embed it in our health facility
 
04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
statute Under The Lure statute so there
 
04:23:03.229 --> 04:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
would be teeth to this bill for purposes
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
of enforcing the provisions of the
 
04:23:07.070 --> 04:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
language of the bill so that's why we
 
04:23:10.189 --> 04:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
sit before you today and uh from our
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
perspective where this is in line with
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
um open access to Services through tele
 
04:23:18.070 --> 04:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
Health tele medicine and to looking to
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
you also represent Pearson in your
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
multiple roles uh as being the chair of
 
04:23:23.950 --> 04:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
the committee that actually looks at the
 
04:23:26.349 --> 04:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
issues of the deaf and heart of hearing
 
04:23:28.229 --> 04:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh I actually be fascinated to find out
 
04:23:29.910 --> 04:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not your committee was a
 
04:23:31.469 --> 04:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
proponent behind this bill and would be
 
04:23:33.189 --> 04:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
supportive of the provisions of the
 
04:23:35.070 --> 04:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
legislation absent the policy committee
 
04:23:37.750 --> 04:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
before you so because the answer to that
 
04:23:39.429 --> 04:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
question is no but I'd still like to
 
04:23:39.439 --> 04:23:41.870 align:start position:0%
question is no but I'd still like to
take

04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:43.950 --> 04:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
credit yeah there there's a famous
 
04:23:45.830 --> 04:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
statement by uh President Kennedy on
 
04:23:48.510 --> 04:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
that so with that um I'm uh looking to
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
miss Shockley because she did such a
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
great job at the last hearing and the
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
questions that were posed go well beyond
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
Health Facilities Administration which
 
04:23:57.950 --> 04:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
she is very skilled and Adept and I
 
04:24:00.109 --> 04:24:00.119 align:start position:0%
would turn over any questions to her but
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
because you're touching upon various
 
04:24:03.910 --> 04:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
areas even outside of the department as
 
04:24:06.349 --> 04:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
it relates to the office of profession
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
Li Insurance certification because
 
04:24:09.750 --> 04:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
providers who are involved with telea
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
health they are the regulatory entities
 
04:24:13.109 --> 04:24:13.119 align:start position:0%
that look at those issues who can
 
04:24:15.510 --> 04:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
participate uh and all those things so
 
04:24:16.950 --> 04:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
it goes well beyond the scope of Miss
 
04:24:18.630 --> 04:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
Shockley in the department but we do
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
want to say uh in reviewing the bill and
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
ref Murray that the department is fine
 
04:24:25.750 --> 04:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
with the provisions in here uh we do
 
04:24:27.149 --> 04:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there could be some
 
04:24:29.229 --> 04:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
level obviously of an impact to the
 
04:24:31.149 --> 04:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
provider Community but as a whole I
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
think everybody in the spirit of working
 
04:24:34.469 --> 04:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
together want to make sure that there is
 
04:24:36.510 --> 04:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
less um barriers to access access to
 
04:24:38.429 --> 04:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
Services particularly around tele Health
 
04:24:40.830 --> 04:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
tele medicine and with that I will
 
04:24:42.349 --> 04:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
conclude my remark that we're available
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
for any questions but I'd like to ask
 
04:24:47.229 --> 04:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
Miss shle if she had anything to add no
 
04:24:51.229 --> 04:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:56.469 --> 04:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:00.189 --> 04:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
Weber forgive me if I'm just putting
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
something in that wasn't in there when
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
you started your remarks you
 
04:25:09.309 --> 04:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
made a statement about the issue for the
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
Department is the drafter placement of
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
the bill were you going to suggest that
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
it should be in a different part of the
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
statutes because at that point I didn't
 
04:25:23.710 --> 04:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
keep up quickly enough with my notes so
 
04:25:27.030 --> 04:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
I I was just trying to clarify if if you
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
were asking for it to be moved somewhere
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
else in the statute or whether it's but
 
04:25:35.389 --> 04:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
then your next remarks made me think it
 
04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
was okay where it was so i' I'd like a
 
04:25:40.389 --> 04:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
little more information on that if if
 
04:25:43.670 --> 04:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
you would considering you have already
 
04:25:45.590 --> 04:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
heard I think about seven going on eight
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
bills today we're going to be working on
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
amendments I'm I'm not here trying to
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
create more work for you however um
 
04:25:54.070 --> 04:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
because those of us whove worked in
 
04:25:55.349 --> 04:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
telea health tele medicine actually
 
04:25:56.830 --> 04:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
drafted the language and worked on it
 
04:25:59.790 --> 04:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
for years repr McKay uh advancing this
 
04:26:03.309 --> 04:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
from its early infancy from 2008 2009
 
04:26:05.269 --> 04:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
that you have to look at telea Health
 
04:26:06.870 --> 04:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
tele medicine at least from our
 
04:26:09.309 --> 04:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
perspective under the insurance statutes
 
04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
as well as under our Medicaid statutes
 
04:26:13.790 --> 04:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of the pay for for those
 
04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
services so that's very far a field from
 
04:26:18.269 --> 04:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
where you are with this legislation
 
04:26:19.950 --> 04:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
which is trying to come up with a way to
 
04:26:22.910 --> 04:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
mandate enforcement of some level with
 
04:26:25.830 --> 04:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
in having providers who do provide these
 
04:26:29.750 --> 04:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
services to uh do meaningful language
 
04:26:32.189 --> 04:26:32.199 align:start position:0%
access to uh limited English uh
 
04:26:33.790 --> 04:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
proficient speakers I'm leading reading
 
04:26:37.349 --> 04:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
directly from the bill itself um again
 
04:26:39.630 --> 04:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
we're here specifically because of our
 
04:26:41.469 --> 04:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
thought that this came to the licensing
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
piece but it it is also equally likely
 
04:26:45.910 --> 04:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
with a little more thought and taking a
 
04:26:47.590 --> 04:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
little more time there could be other
 
04:26:49.630 --> 04:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
placements you would want to look at
 
04:26:51.229 --> 04:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
either under the office of professional
 
04:26:53.790 --> 04:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
lure and certification statutes dealing
 
04:26:55.349 --> 04:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
with the various providers who provide
 
04:26:57.670 --> 04:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
tele Health tele medicine and there's a
 
04:26:59.550 --> 04:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
whole array of statutes that that would
 
04:27:01.870 --> 04:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
touch upon also under the Department of
 
04:27:04.469 --> 04:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
Insurance there Provisions regarding um
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
the um tele Health tele I'm looking at
 
04:27:07.950 --> 04:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
represent Shapiro because I had some
 
04:27:09.309 --> 04:27:09.319 align:start position:0%
memory of us working on something
 
04:27:10.830 --> 04:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with tele Health tele medicine
 
04:27:13.070 --> 04:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
last four or five years and also looking
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
to the department under
 
04:27:18.469 --> 04:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
167 um RSA 167 which is our provision
 
04:27:20.070 --> 04:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
around Medicaid for T Health tele
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
medicine and it's why Miss Shockley
 
04:27:23.950 --> 04:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
brought me up as her de facto kind of
 
04:27:25.469 --> 04:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
attorney for the day since her other
 
04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
attorney is in ways and means right
 
04:27:33.269 --> 04:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
Weber I guess my question is can we
 
04:27:39.550 --> 04:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
simplify all of this by just saying all
 
04:27:40.550 --> 04:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
doing is extending something that is
 
04:27:46.710 --> 04:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
already being done with procedures that
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
are already being in place to another
 
04:27:54.670 --> 04:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
delivery system and therefore we don't
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
have to reinvent the wheel in every
 
04:27:58.670 --> 04:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
single part of the
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
statute is that a fair way of thinking
 
04:28:03.109 --> 04:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
of it I mean we could just leave it as
 
04:28:06.429 --> 04:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
it is because we're already deliver ing
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
this service and it's being paid for by
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
somebody and we don't necessarily need
 
04:28:15.109 --> 04:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
to know who it's just if we're treating
 
04:28:15.119 --> 04:28:16.670 align:start position:0%
to know who it's just if we're treating
a

04:28:16.670 --> 04:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:28:21.389 --> 04:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
patient uh via in person or telea
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
medicine we're going to have to provide
 
04:28:28.429 --> 04:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.910 --> 04:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
accommodations again we will just state
 
04:28:32.429 --> 04:28:32.439 align:start position:0%
that we are fine with the current
 
04:28:34.070 --> 04:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
language here but I do need to make the
 
04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
articulation that these are licensed
 
04:28:38.990 --> 04:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
facilities not providers under this
 
04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
section that's why I'm saying with a
 
04:28:43.149 --> 04:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
little more time and energy you may want
 
04:28:46.349 --> 04:28:46.359 align:start position:0%
to identify other statutory placement
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
for purposes of ensuring that this will
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
go across to include providers that's
 
04:28:52.870 --> 04:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
why I reference the office of
 
04:28:54.429 --> 04:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
professional Li Insurance certification
 
04:28:55.990 --> 04:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
statutes because that's the provider
 
04:28:58.590 --> 04:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
level responsibility around T Health
 
04:29:01.389 --> 04:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
tele medicine not not under our
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
licensing facilities and miss miss shley
 
04:29:03.840 --> 04:29:04.710 align:start position:0%
licensing facilities and miss miss shley
you

04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:29:04.720 --> 04:29:06.750 align:start position:0%
you
agree

04:29:06.750 --> 04:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
yes I agree but I think John's comments
 
04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
like right there helped clarify that
 
04:29:14.510 --> 04:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
that the RSA 151 what we oversee and
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
regulate our health facilities and this
 
04:29:20.349 --> 04:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
addition looks specific to the providers
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
in the facilities so if the goal is for
 
04:29:27.229 --> 04:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
um regulatory oversight that may not
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
fall under our purview though we are in
 
04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
language representative
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
04:29:44.590 --> 04:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
touched upon the issue of insurance
 
04:29:47.710 --> 04:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
which sort of what I'm thinking thr and
 
04:29:51.429 --> 04:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
help me here is that there's
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
a process of building the insurance
 
04:29:57.790 --> 04:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
company for this cost if we have a
 
04:30:00.830 --> 04:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
telephonic translator and so forth today
 
04:30:02.830 --> 04:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
does a facility or a provider anyone
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
using it build the insurance company in
 
04:30:07.109 --> 04:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies required to pay
 
04:30:09.309 --> 04:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
for it or is it something in which the
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
facility is taken as part of the overall
 
04:30:13.389 --> 04:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
reimbursement the cost is included in
 
04:30:14.910 --> 04:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
that re overall
 
04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and you've now exceeded my
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
my knowledge base I would have to defer
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
to someone else to answer that question
 
04:30:21.600 --> 04:30:22.309 align:start position:0%
to someone else to answer that question
thank

04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:30:24.750 --> 04:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:30:27.670 --> 04:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
fome thank you chairman Pearson thanks
 
04:30:31.469 --> 04:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
for uh letting me ask this question
 
04:30:34.950 --> 04:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
um this is just curiosity because I
 
04:30:37.469 --> 04:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
don't know as much about these
 
04:30:41.389 --> 04:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
laws if someone comes to your office to
 
04:30:44.790 --> 04:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
the provider facility and they speak
 
04:30:48.109 --> 04:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
Chinese um you don't have interpreters
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
for Chinese you have Spanish you have
 
04:30:52.830 --> 04:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
Russian you have
 
04:30:56.830 --> 04:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
whatever can you refer them to a
 
04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
different Facility Who then may have a
 
04:31:04.710 --> 04:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
Chinese person without getting in
 
04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
trouble with this law like is every
 
04:31:13.790 --> 04:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:16.349 --> 04:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
language and I would have to defer to
 
04:31:18.550 --> 04:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
the provider Community as to what is the
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
current state of matters how they
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
address it I mean my knowledge is that
 
04:31:27.389 --> 04:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
most provider communities provide some
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
level to the extent that they have the
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
resources to do that whether as you know
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
is simply from your phones nowadays you
 
04:31:36.269 --> 04:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
can go and convert language from one to
 
04:31:39.149 --> 04:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
the next it so so I would have to defer
 
04:31:41.109 --> 04:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
to somebody else about what currently is
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
out there what we would require in terms
 
04:31:45.389 --> 04:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
of a licensing perspective here under
 
04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
dorin shop is just to make sure that
 
04:31:49.469 --> 04:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
there's compliance with the federal
 
04:31:52.349 --> 04:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
citations here for the cfrs relative to
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
those facilities offering whatever is
 
04:31:57.070 --> 04:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
required under federal law for those
 
04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
services so doesn't it come down to
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
whatever the law says we have to do
 
04:32:07.229 --> 04:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
about languages in an in-person
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
visit now you've got to do it in a tele
 
04:32:10.199 --> 04:32:11.309 align:start position:0%
visit now you've got to do it in a tele

04:32:30.510 --> 04:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
Mayon um thank you chairman Pearson and
 
04:32:33.070 --> 04:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking this question um
 
04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
one of my questions is how this actually
 
04:32:38.590 --> 04:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
gets implemented in a tella Health visit
 
04:32:40.109 --> 04:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
I know that there's lots of different
 
04:32:42.510 --> 04:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
ways to have tella Health you could have
 
04:32:44.349 --> 04:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
screen to screen you could have it on as
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
a telephone is that set up in the ones
 
04:32:49.469 --> 04:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
that providers and Facilities have
 
04:32:52.229 --> 04:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
already invested in is it compatible
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
with introducing language services or
 
04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
are we asking them to potentially
 
04:32:58.030 --> 04:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
purchase a whole new
 
04:33:00.269 --> 04:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
platform and and chairman Pearson
 
04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
respectfully um that is beyond our
 
04:33:04.590 --> 04:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge base here as to what the
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
provider community does I can give you a
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
very high level explanation but I think
 
04:33:10.709 --> 04:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
the level of detail you're looking for
 
04:33:13.629 --> 04:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
represent Lon really is best served by
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative either through the
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
office of professional LIC Insurance
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
certification they're great to work with
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
um attorney uh Lindsay Courtney is their
 
04:33:22.269 --> 04:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
executive director and I'm happy to have
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
her be in touch with anybody on this
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
committee as it may relate to getting
 
04:33:28.390 --> 04:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
the right person from oplc in touch with
 
04:33:31.470 --> 04:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
you about expectations for for providers
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
we we try to be very clear we're we're a
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
big agency but when I'm getting out when
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
we're getting outside of our our pond
 
04:33:38.551 --> 04:33:38.561 align:start position:0%
Dorian you will let me
 
04:33:41.230 --> 04:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
know I'm speaking for myself but I'm
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
sensing maybe more than myself that
 
04:33:46.869 --> 04:33:46.879 align:start position:0%
there there is sympathy very much for
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
this but I I need to know some more
 
04:33:51.990 --> 04:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
detail as to
 
04:33:54.990 --> 04:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
how so we' be looking forward to that
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
before we work on this again
 
04:34:00.869 --> 04:34:00.879 align:start position:0%

Weber
 
04:34:08.189 --> 04:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
you may not be the right person for me
 
04:34:10.230 --> 04:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
to ask this question but I'm going to
 
04:34:13.320 --> 04:34:13.330 align:start position:0%
ask it anyway you're right here would
 
04:34:13.330 --> 04:34:14.429 align:start position:0%
ask it anyway you're right here would
[Music]

04:34:14.429 --> 04:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:34:18.349 --> 04:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
I be safe in
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
assuming that all of those people to
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
whom this is
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
addressed many of whom have lobbyists to
 
04:34:30.789 --> 04:34:30.799 align:start position:0%
monitor legislation on their behalf and
 
04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
none of whom seem to be here unless
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
they're pink cards that we haven't seen
 
04:34:36.551 --> 04:34:36.561 align:start position:0%
or or
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh who are the absence of
 
04:34:44.349 --> 04:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
anybody here to explain to us why this
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
is going to be terribly inconvenient for
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
any of the providers it
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:58.510 --> 04:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
question is that question for the
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
Department um so um I think you're
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
you're identifying the two people before
 
04:35:04.990 --> 04:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
you today are here to talk to you about
 
04:35:06.910 --> 04:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
the bill in the four corners in front of
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
you as it relates to facilities
 
04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
licensing we are not the office of
 
04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
we are happy to get people connected
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
with them the lobbying of the government
 
04:35:18.029 --> 04:35:18.039 align:start position:0%
relations Community they're wonderful to
 
04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
work with and strong proponents of the
 
04:35:21.189 --> 04:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
importance of teleah Health tele
 
04:35:23.869 --> 04:35:23.879 align:start position:0%
medicine and but I'm not in a position
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
to asking any of them to please approach
 
04:35:27.629 --> 04:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
you to start answering some of the very
 
04:35:30.109 --> 04:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
good questions good questions that this
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
committee is is offering um we do think
 
04:35:34.910 --> 04:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
that the the underlying bill here we are
 
04:35:36.910 --> 04:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
fine fine with this and if this is all
 
04:35:38.709 --> 04:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
you did you would not hear anything from
 
04:35:41.310 --> 04:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
04:35:44.629 --> 04:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
Services other than we were fine
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
with any further
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:03.750 --> 04:36:03.760 align:start position:0%

04:49:50.230 --> 04:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
because then you get residuals every

members of the committee committee um my
 
04:52:37.070 --> 04:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
name is Jeff grion I'm the
 
04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative for Grafton County
 
04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
District 16 specifically from the town
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
of Wentworth as much as is known about
 
04:52:47.990 --> 04:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 much more remains unknown and
 
04:52:50.430 --> 04:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
we've heard terms like Spike proteins
 
04:52:53.350 --> 04:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
and cyto storms but since most of us are
 
04:52:56.310 --> 04:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
not microbiologists or virologists our
 
04:52:58.230 --> 04:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is very limited and we are
 
04:52:59.670 --> 04:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
dependent on the Integrity of
 
04:53:02.030 --> 04:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
researchers to inform us of their
 
04:53:05.190 --> 04:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
findings fully and TR truthfully I won't
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
go into an explanation unless you want
 
04:53:08.750 --> 04:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
it of exactly what is happening in the
 
04:53:10.990 --> 04:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
body with the viruses I have looked it
 
04:53:13.310 --> 04:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
up from those who have explained it but
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
the pandemic precipitated the rapid
 
04:53:18.430 --> 04:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
production of vaccines aimed at
 
04:53:20.830 --> 04:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
stimulating the production of antibodies
 
04:53:23.030 --> 04:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
that would prevent the spike protein
 
04:53:25.628 --> 04:53:25.638 align:start position:0%
from binding to target cells and if you
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
see those pictures on the news of this
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
orb with the things protruding from it
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
like rays of the sun those things that
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
are protruding from it are the spike
 
04:53:39.470 --> 04:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
proteins and it's those Spike proteins
 
04:53:42.430 --> 04:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
that will adhere to the cells of your
 
04:53:44.430 --> 04:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
body my body anybody once the virus
 
04:53:48.310 --> 04:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
enters the body and it will attempt to
 
04:53:52.548 --> 04:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
um attach itself to a healthy body
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
cell which will then later cause damage
 
04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
and the infection and uh and and go on
 
04:54:01.788 --> 04:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
to to produce problems for you but the
 
04:54:03.708 --> 04:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines that have been introduced our i
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
l to make us immune to the virus they
 
04:54:09.030 --> 04:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
use newly developed mRNA technology
 
04:54:10.990 --> 04:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's designed to produce the same
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
Spike protein as the virus itself but in
 
04:54:16.510 --> 04:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
a more controlled manner so as to teach
 
04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
the body to develop a proper immune
 
04:54:20.788 --> 04:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
response yielding to immunity from the
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
actual virus that's all well and good
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's what it should be but these mRNA
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines are not the same as traditional
 
04:54:31.070 --> 04:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines such as polio MMR small poox
 
04:54:33.030 --> 04:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
they don't use the actual virus to
 
04:54:33.040 --> 04:54:33.990 align:start position:0%
they don't use the actual virus to
develop

04:54:33.990 --> 04:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
develop
 
04:54:37.470 --> 04:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
the vaccine that means the MRNA vaccines
 
04:54:39.990 --> 04:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
produce the same Spike proteins as the
 
04:54:42.750 --> 04:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
virus but that's by Design these Spike
 
04:54:45.548 --> 04:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
proteins should stay firmly attached to
 
04:54:47.708 --> 04:54:47.718 align:start position:0%
the outside of the muscle cells at the
 
04:54:50.350 --> 04:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
injection site so that the immune system
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes them and makes the specific
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
immune response however a study
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
conducted at Bristol Medical School in
 
04:54:59.670 --> 04:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
the UK showed that some spike proteins
 
04:55:01.750 --> 04:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
become soluble and float in the
 
04:55:03.150 --> 04:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
bloodstream where they can wind up in
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
VAR organs of the body and one common
 
04:55:07.868 --> 04:55:07.878 align:start position:0%
place that Spike proteins have been
 
04:55:10.390 --> 04:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
found is the capillaries of the heart
 
04:55:12.350 --> 04:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
resulting in inflammation and clot
 
04:55:15.190 --> 04:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
formation in a study uh published by the
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
National Institutes for health entitled
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
be be aware of SARS Cove 2 Spike protein
 
04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
there's more that meets the eye the
 
04:55:25.270 --> 04:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
authors warn quote certain antibodies in
 
04:55:27.270 --> 04:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
the blood of infected patients appear to
 
04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
change the shape of the spike protein so
 
04:55:32.670 --> 04:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
as to make it more likely to bind to
 
04:55:35.350 --> 04:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
cells and it goes on further to say
 
04:55:37.750 --> 04:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
quote the spike protein by itself
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
without being part of the Corona virus
 
04:55:42.470 --> 04:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
can damage endothelial cells and disrupt
 
04:55:44.830 --> 04:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
the blood brain barrier so this means
 
04:55:46.868 --> 04:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
that the spike protein produced by the
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine may damage endothelial cells and
 
04:55:52.868 --> 04:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
disrupt the bloodb brain barrier another
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
study published by the national institut
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
for health in December of last year
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
States the SARS Cove 2 Spike protein
 
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
disrupts human cardiac parasite function
 
04:56:03.948 --> 04:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
so in other words these Spike proteins
 
04:56:07.030 --> 04:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
adversely affect the heart so we know
 
04:56:10.990 --> 04:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
from from hearing in the news stories uh
 
04:56:12.350 --> 04:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
we know that people have experienced
 
04:56:14.190 --> 04:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
blood clots subsequent to receiving a
 
04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine we know many young people have
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
experienced myocarditis or pericarditis
 
04:56:21.070 --> 04:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
following vaccination an alarming number
 
04:56:22.948 --> 04:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
of athletes of all skill levels have
 
04:56:24.548 --> 04:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
collapsed on their fields of play and
 
04:56:26.750 --> 04:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
have died all of whom were vaccinated
 
04:56:29.230 --> 04:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
shortly before the episode and I have a
 
04:56:31.548 --> 04:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
list of over 75 names of athletes from
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
around the world who have suddenly died
 
04:56:35.670 --> 04:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
of heart failure shortly after receiving
 
04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
the vaccine now this is not a Slam
 
04:56:40.990 --> 04:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
against vaccines it's just this is new
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
technology and the and the bill before
 
04:56:47.670 --> 04:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
you is is intended to study scientific
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
study of the effects of the vaccine if
 
04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
there are any for reference the New
 
04:56:54.350 --> 04:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
England Journal of Medicine produced a
 
04:56:57.788 --> 04:56:57.798 align:start position:0%
study in November of 2017 prec covid
 
04:57:00.150 --> 04:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
entitled sudden Cardiac Arrest during
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
participation in competitive Sports in
 
04:57:04.548 --> 04:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
which they state the incidence of sudden
 
04:57:06.548 --> 04:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
Cardiac Arrest during participation in
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
sports was 76 cases per 100,000 athlete
 
04:57:13.470 --> 04:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
years so in other words it just doesn't
 
04:57:15.948 --> 04:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
happen that often and this growing list
 
04:57:18.470 --> 04:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
of athletes dying is not
 
04:57:20.830 --> 04:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
normal advancements in technology that
 
04:57:22.948 --> 04:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
produced the new mRNA vaccine occurred
 
04:57:24.750 --> 04:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
so rapidly that full understanding of
 
04:57:26.990 --> 04:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
the effects of these vaccines short and
 
04:57:30.510 --> 04:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
long term on human bodies is not known
 
04:57:32.470 --> 04:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
and may not be fully known for many
 
04:57:33.788 --> 04:57:33.798 align:start position:0%
years to come
 
04:57:36.150 --> 04:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
we also know that information regarding
 
04:57:38.030 --> 04:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
what's in the vaccines or any of the
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
test results uh pre-release won't be
 
04:57:44.110 --> 04:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
available for up to 75 years now I don't
 
04:57:45.990 --> 04:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
know about you but I probably won't be
 
04:57:48.590 --> 04:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
here in 75 years to find out although I
 
04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
might like to hang on just to see what's
 
04:57:50.320 --> 04:57:51.150 align:start position:0%
might like to hang on just to see what's
actually

04:57:51.150 --> 04:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:57:54.990 --> 04:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
released therefore hb1 1634 is proposed
 
04:57:57.310 --> 04:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
to establish a grant program for the
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of researching the effects if
 
04:58:02.070 --> 04:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
any on the human body by vaccines
 
04:58:03.628 --> 04:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
administered to prevent the virus
 
04:58:06.350 --> 04:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
commonly known as covid-19 so some
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
questions that were are worth asking and
 
04:58:09.948 --> 04:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
studying for an answer include do the
 
04:58:12.750 --> 04:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
spike proteins produced by the vaccine
 
04:58:14.470 --> 04:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
have the same effect on the body as the
 
04:58:16.910 --> 04:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
spike proteins of the actual virus is
 
04:58:18.868 --> 04:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
there any causal relationship between
 
04:58:20.788 --> 04:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
mRNA vaccines and cardiac and other
 
04:58:22.990 --> 04:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
injuries are there any noticeable and
 
04:58:24.830 --> 04:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
notable differences in Damage Done to
 
04:58:26.670 --> 04:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
the bodies of vaccinated and
 
04:58:28.948 --> 04:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated people who die of the same
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
cause this bill would use money given to
 
04:58:32.830 --> 04:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
the state for covid Relief thus would
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
not be be from the regular state budget
 
04:58:37.470 --> 04:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
if the first phase of the study shows no
 
04:58:39.628 --> 04:58:39.638 align:start position:0%
need for further study then no further
 
04:58:41.510 --> 04:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
study is done and money set aside would
 
04:58:43.390 --> 04:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
revert back to the general fund and
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's all perfectly acceptable science
 
04:58:47.470 --> 04:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
is allowed this the scientific method
 
04:58:49.150 --> 04:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
proper science is done you can have a
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
hypothesis you can think something is
 
04:58:52.990 --> 04:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
going to be one way but hey you're
 
04:58:54.670 --> 04:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
proven wrong there's nothing wrong with
 
04:58:57.230 --> 04:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
being wrong the problem with being wrong
 
04:58:59.830 --> 04:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
and going on and and saying something is
 
04:59:01.868 --> 04:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
true when you know it's not true that's
 
04:59:03.948 --> 04:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
where the problem breaks or are the
 
04:59:06.510 --> 04:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
problems occur so this is scientific
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
inquiry that's all this is this is how
 
04:59:11.110 --> 04:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
we learn we go in and with no
 
04:59:12.868 --> 04:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
preconceived notions no pre-drawn
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
conclusions we allow the truth to Reve
 
04:59:17.470 --> 04:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
reveal itself because a lot of policies
 
04:59:19.548 --> 04:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
we are in this room all representatives
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
of policy makers we make decisions but
 
04:59:23.910 --> 04:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's not just at the state level it's in
 
04:59:25.868 --> 04:59:25.878 align:start position:0%
every level of our personal lives all
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
the way around the country every single
 
04:59:29.548 --> 04:59:29.558 align:start position:0%
person makes decisions based on
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
information that they receive and if
 
04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
they're given good information they can
 
04:59:35.788 --> 04:59:35.798 align:start position:0%
make good decisions if they're given bad
 
04:59:38.030 --> 04:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
information they can make bad decisions
 
04:59:39.788 --> 04:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
so what we want to do is allow real
 
04:59:41.948 --> 04:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
science to guide our decision making and
 
04:59:44.390 --> 04:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's what hb1 1634 seeks to do that's
 
04:59:46.788 --> 04:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
all I have sir thank you
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
representative does anyone have a
 
04:59:52.750 --> 04:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
question representative kerk just a
 
04:59:54.830 --> 04:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
quick one you alluded to it might take
 
04:59:57.430 --> 04:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
75 years before we actually will know
 
05:00:01.510 --> 05:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
the some of the science given that uh
 
05:00:03.310 --> 05:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
why do you think it's reasonable that we
 
05:00:05.310 --> 05:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
would find it with a state Grant within
 
05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
one year well the release of information
 
05:00:12.390 --> 05:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh from Mna and fiser about their the
 
05:00:14.030 --> 05:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
studies that they is not because the
 
05:00:16.270 --> 05:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
science isn't completed it's that's how
 
05:00:18.190 --> 05:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
long they're taking to release the
 
05:00:20.430 --> 05:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
information so it it's not that it's
 
05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
taken 75 years to determine the science
 
05:00:24.708 --> 05:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
it's taken 75 years to release the
 
05:00:27.230 --> 05:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
records that no that's that's what
 
05:00:31.030 --> 05:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing 500 pages a day or
 
05:00:33.150 --> 05:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
something like that it's they said 7 5
 
05:00:35.230 --> 05:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
years to release the information so it's
 
05:00:37.310 --> 05:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
not the study hasn't been conducted it's
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
taken that long to release the
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
information so yes this information this
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
study could be done in one to two years
 
05:00:46.190 --> 05:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
or uh over a period of two years with
 
05:00:47.910 --> 05:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
with findings being
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
released like to call on our house
 
05:00:53.430 --> 05:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist representative Solway oh
 
05:00:54.868 --> 05:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:00:56.110 --> 05:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for bringing
 
05:00:59.830 --> 05:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
forth this bill I am always eagerly
 
05:01:02.510 --> 05:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
interested in the granting process
 
05:01:04.868 --> 05:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
having spent a career involved in it
 
05:01:07.590 --> 05:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
from both sides as a grantee and a
 
05:01:11.830 --> 05:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
grantor have you taken a look at the
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that foundations and NIH and
 
05:01:19.990 --> 05:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
drug companies put into place to
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
generate Grant applications review them
 
05:01:27.270 --> 05:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
fund them and monitor them have you
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
taken a look at those systems and asked
 
05:01:35.230 --> 05:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
if the the state of New Hampshire is
 
05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
capable of putting in place systems that
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:45.510 --> 05:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
granting are you suggesting that there's
 
05:01:47.590 --> 05:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
not a mechanism for the state to be able
 
05:01:50.030 --> 05:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
to take
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
monies and issue a grant I'm not sure I
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
understand your question may follow up
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
05:02:04.948 --> 05:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
um the drug companies NIH even our New
 
05:02:08.990 --> 05:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charal Foundation have in
 
05:02:12.948 --> 05:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
Place Extended panels of professionals
 
05:02:15.830 --> 05:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
to review Grant
 
05:02:18.868 --> 05:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
applications to they work hard to
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
generate those applications because they
 
05:02:23.548 --> 05:02:23.558 align:start position:0%
they don't just you don't just put an ad
 
05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the conquered Monitor and say all
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
those who want money please apply um and
 
05:02:30.350 --> 05:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
then they have to monitor them it's an
 
05:02:34.270 --> 05:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
extremely complex process that takes a
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
great deal of time to put in place and
 
05:02:39.150 --> 05:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
to make work and I just wondered if you
 
05:02:42.430 --> 05:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
had taken a look by the way I don't
 
05:02:45.310 --> 05:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
disagree with almost all of what you
 
05:02:45.320 --> 05:02:46.150 align:start position:0%
disagree with almost all of what you
have

05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:02:49.030 --> 05:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
reviewed what I'm looking at is what
 
05:02:51.548 --> 05:02:51.558 align:start position:0%
kind of structure do you need to put in
 
05:02:55.670 --> 05:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
place in order to make research happen
 
05:02:57.310 --> 05:02:57.320 align:start position:0%
and I've been on both sides of that and
 
05:02:59.868 --> 05:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
I want to know if you've taken a look at
 
05:03:03.708 --> 05:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
what those systems are and in fact
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
are we positioned to create those kinds
 
05:03:08.270 --> 05:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
of systems here in New Hampshire that's
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
my question does the state presently
 
05:03:13.390 --> 05:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
offer any kind of Grants at all for
 
05:03:13.400 --> 05:03:15.070 align:start position:0%
offer any kind of Grants at all for
scientific

05:03:15.070 --> 05:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
05:03:17.868 --> 05:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
inquiry the state does
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
contract research it does
 
05:03:24.548 --> 05:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
smallscale contracts to serve the needs
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
of specific programs but general
 
05:03:29.788 --> 05:03:29.798 align:start position:0%
research no I don't know of any states
 
05:03:29.798 --> 05:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
research no I don't know of any states
that

05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
out again this this sounds a lot more
 
05:03:42.910 --> 05:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
complicated than it probably needs to be
 
05:03:45.350 --> 05:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's clearly a mechanism for which to
 
05:03:47.150 --> 05:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
conduct scientific study in the state of
 
05:03:49.868 --> 05:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have state universities
 
05:03:52.830 --> 05:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
we have uh they they can uh they can
 
05:03:54.548 --> 05:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
apply for the grant there's somebody
 
05:03:57.150 --> 05:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
wanting to get a PhD in something I'll
 
05:03:59.070 --> 05:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer to do a PhD if somebody was
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
willing to award it to me just so I can
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
do the study for it I love science I'm a
 
05:04:04.990 --> 05:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
meteorologist I'm an oceanographer so I
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
have allies after my name so I'd love to
 
05:04:08.910 --> 05:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
do the research if someone's willing to
 
05:04:13.310 --> 05:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
convey a PhD for me um but uh there
 
05:04:14.948 --> 05:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
there has to be a mechanism I think it I
 
05:04:17.230 --> 05:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
think it's a lot it doesn't matter what
 
05:04:22.990 --> 05:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.788 --> 05:04:25.798 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
05:04:28.590 --> 05:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
you for taking these questions I have
 
05:04:33.430 --> 05:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
um first question is since I'm not
 
05:04:39.070 --> 05:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with um the information you
 
05:04:43.070 --> 05:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
cited about um athletes suddenly dying
 
05:04:45.510 --> 05:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
could you provide myself or the
 
05:04:47.590 --> 05:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
committee with uh some kind of reference
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
to that I can send you a link to a news
 
05:04:53.830 --> 05:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
article that goes on to link to other
 
05:04:57.990 --> 05:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
news articles uh because it it clear
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
lists okay I would appreciate that the
 
05:05:01.750 --> 05:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
different an different stories yeah I
 
05:05:04.750 --> 05:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
sure can follow up yeah my second
 
05:05:07.548 --> 05:05:07.558 align:start position:0%
question is um you know you spoke very
 
05:05:09.948 --> 05:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
eloquently about this being about
 
05:05:12.750 --> 05:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
scientific inquiry yeah um that we don't
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
know the answers and that's all the more
 
05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
reason why we have to um study this to
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
find the answers um and that was well
 
05:05:24.430 --> 05:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
said I agree with you um however as we
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
all know this is an incredibly
 
05:05:27.360 --> 05:05:28.910 align:start position:0%
all know this is an incredibly
contentious

05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
contentious
 
05:05:32.670 --> 05:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
area people um have very strong strong
 
05:05:36.510 --> 05:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
opinions very strong ideas about this
 
05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
um many of them I'm afraid fairly fixed
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
so I wonder if you've given thought
 
05:05:46.868 --> 05:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
should this bill be passed and signed
 
05:05:50.510 --> 05:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
and should this program um come to
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
fruition have you given thought about
 
05:05:56.070 --> 05:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
how to make this
 
05:06:01.548 --> 05:06:01.558 align:start position:0%
process um objective and um to deal with
 
05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
the all the cont Consciousness that
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
would um likely come up in the process
 
05:06:10.030 --> 05:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of who's appointed to decide on
 
05:06:13.230 --> 05:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
grants in terms of how people apply for
 
05:06:16.110 --> 05:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
Grants um I guess I'm wondering if
 
05:06:18.510 --> 05:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
you've given thought about how to make
 
05:06:20.788 --> 05:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
this a
 
05:06:28.190 --> 05:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:33.230 --> 05:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
um um scientific study in terms of
 
05:06:36.910 --> 05:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
instead of it just becoming a political
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
brawl unfortunately representative thank
 
05:06:41.270 --> 05:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
you for the question you're right uh
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this has become
 
05:06:45.788 --> 05:06:45.798 align:start position:0%
contentious science has become
 
05:06:50.470 --> 05:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
contentious um it it bothers me that
 
05:06:53.470 --> 05:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
science has become corrupted in such a
 
05:06:56.350 --> 05:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
way that um we're not even allowed to
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
ask questions anymore without being
 
05:07:00.750 --> 05:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
labeled pejoratives of various sorts by
 
05:07:02.670 --> 05:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
any by either side it's not the not a
 
05:07:05.628 --> 05:07:05.638 align:start position:0%
political attack by on anyone uh but
 
05:07:08.430 --> 05:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
science itself has taken a a real black
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
eye uh in in this area that's why when
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
it comes to it's a risk that science
 
05:07:17.200 --> 05:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
it comes to it's a risk that science
must

05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
must
 
05:07:21.230 --> 05:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
take science is risky science is always
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
daring science is always bold there's
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
always somebody willing to say the Earth
 
05:07:25.600 --> 05:07:26.910 align:start position:0%
always somebody willing to say the Earth
is

05:07:26.910 --> 05:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:07:29.788 --> 05:07:29.798 align:start position:0%
round when everyone else says no it's
 
05:07:33.868 --> 05:07:33.878 align:start position:0%
flat so it shouldn't be but it will be
 
05:07:35.910 --> 05:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh that's why there's monies available
 
05:07:37.830 --> 05:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
with caps on how much different group
 
05:07:41.150 --> 05:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
this allows multiple uh recipients to
 
05:07:44.750 --> 05:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
study you may get you may get all of
 
05:07:47.070 --> 05:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
them come up with the same conclusion
 
05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
they may all again there's the only way
 
05:07:56.430 --> 05:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
is is to take and and take the the
 
05:07:56.440 --> 05:07:57.548 align:start position:0%
is is to take and and take the the
Lessons

05:07:57.548 --> 05:07:57.558 align:start position:0%
Lessons
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
Learned whatever those lessons are and
 
05:08:03.390 --> 05:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
just speak them and then
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
everybody you you can't hide it you
 
05:08:09.270 --> 05:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
can't whitewash it you can't uh say
 
05:08:11.390 --> 05:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
something and and you hide the truth you
 
05:08:13.470 --> 05:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
need to let the truth the truth will
 
05:08:15.830 --> 05:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
make us free that's the only thing I can
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
tell you it it's a risk that we're
 
05:08:18.990 --> 05:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
willing to that we must be willing to
 
05:08:22.708 --> 05:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
take to learn what the truth
 
05:08:26.350 --> 05:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
is representative would you be prepared
 
05:08:28.670 --> 05:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
to if you haven't done so already send
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
us in written form your opening
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
statement I sure can thank
 
05:08:38.350 --> 05:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Leon was next um
 
05:08:39.788 --> 05:08:39.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:08:42.150 --> 05:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
05:08:43.948 --> 05:08:43.958 align:start position:0%
um I think that one of the important
 
05:08:46.910 --> 05:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
points of this is that you're looking to
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
have a study of organs um as opposed to
 
05:08:52.510 --> 05:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
live patients or anything else do you
 
05:08:55.628 --> 05:08:55.638 align:start position:0%
think by um by having a process where
 
05:08:56.948 --> 05:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
you're accessing these organs and
 
05:08:59.230 --> 05:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
there's less risk than working with live
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
patients that that's going to be an
 
05:09:03.030 --> 05:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
easier process and some of these other
 
05:09:06.110 --> 05:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
ones that need the very rigorous Grant
 
05:09:09.628 --> 05:09:09.638 align:start position:0%
programs thank you representative the
 
05:09:14.948 --> 05:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
yes the the effect of on the organs um
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
is is really where the study goes um I I
 
05:09:22.270 --> 05:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
picture two
 
05:09:24.990 --> 05:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
hearts people have died of the same
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
cause roughly the same age person one
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
person is vaccinated one person is
 
05:09:33.628 --> 05:09:33.638 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated in in my
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
mind given everything else being equal
 
05:09:41.190 --> 05:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
the two hearts should show equal
 
05:09:43.670 --> 05:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
damage but if there's a difference why
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
was there a
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
difference that's the answer that's the
 
05:09:48.990 --> 05:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
question that needs to ask and that's
 
05:09:51.310 --> 05:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
the answer that we're searching for we
 
05:09:53.230 --> 05:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
know that the spike proteins I say we
 
05:09:57.230 --> 05:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
know scientific study has indicated uh
 
05:10:00.150 --> 05:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
that these Spike proteins cause blood
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
clots in the vessels around the heart
 
05:10:04.628 --> 05:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
causing heart
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
failure so if we see in the in the
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
vaccinated heart or excuse me the
 
05:10:11.470 --> 05:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated heart these Spike proteins
 
05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
we could reasonably conclude this person
 
05:10:16.628 --> 05:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
had covid at some time in their life if
 
05:10:19.948 --> 05:10:19.958 align:start position:0%
we see the same Spike proteins of the
 
05:10:23.310 --> 05:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
same quantities the same level of damage
 
05:10:25.110 --> 05:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
then we could reasonably in the person
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
who who is vaccinated and we could
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
reasonably conclude that the vaccine had
 
05:10:32.270 --> 05:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
no effect or we don't know for sure but
 
05:10:34.110 --> 05:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
if we see that the vaccine the
 
05:10:36.470 --> 05:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated person had a
 
05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
considerable greater quantity of the
 
05:10:43.030 --> 05:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
spike proteins or blood clots or damage
 
05:10:45.110 --> 05:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh over the unvaccinated person then we
 
05:10:46.628 --> 05:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
might be able to conclude that the
 
05:10:48.430 --> 05:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine but that's only one that's only
 
05:10:50.670 --> 05:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
one person that's only one one one one
 
05:10:52.590 --> 05:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
test there would have to be others it's
 
05:10:55.070 --> 05:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
a science is is a repeatable thing you
 
05:10:56.830 --> 05:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
can't go in do one test get one answer
 
05:10:58.868 --> 05:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
and that's it you publish and that's it
 
05:11:00.350 --> 05:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
you have to have multiple tests science
 
05:11:02.708 --> 05:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
is a repeatable thing and it may be that
 
05:11:05.070 --> 05:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
there was something just different who
 
05:11:07.750 --> 05:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
knows but if four or five or six or 10
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
whatever different tests are conducted
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
and they all come up with the same
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
conclusion there's no effect or there is
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
an effect whatever the case may be but
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it would end up being the the the
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
testing would be would be done best on
 
05:11:24.868 --> 05:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
those who have perished uh one way or
 
05:11:27.390 --> 05:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
the other follow up follow up um would
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
you believe that Dr reneu verani or ver
 
05:11:34.470 --> 05:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
the Dr who is a pathophysiologist who
 
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
determined what was causing late stent
 
05:11:39.270 --> 05:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
thrombosis with drug eling stent was
 
05:11:41.548 --> 05:11:41.558 align:start position:0%
able to do this with just one lab on a
 
05:11:43.470 --> 05:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
far smaller budget than you're proposing
 
05:11:46.350 --> 05:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
with these grants I not aware of that
 
05:11:49.230 --> 05:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I know that there is a
 
05:11:52.708 --> 05:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
doctor in Idaho who had conducted
 
05:11:52.718 --> 05:11:54.708 align:start position:0%
doctor in Idaho who had conducted
autopsies

05:11:54.708 --> 05:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
autopsies
 
05:11:59.470 --> 05:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
and had his results but again this is
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
um you know I didn't I didn't pull owed
 
05:12:04.150 --> 05:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
his results to to because he's just one
 
05:12:06.430 --> 05:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
person it's not an official scientific
 
05:12:08.310 --> 05:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
study that he was conducting he's a he
 
05:12:11.670 --> 05:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
was a physician or or some sort uh
 
05:12:13.070 --> 05:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
actually he's a pathologist excuse me
 
05:12:17.230 --> 05:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
he's a pathologist and so um but no I
 
05:12:18.910 --> 05:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
again if they could we could do it on
 
05:12:20.548 --> 05:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
less money fine and dandy I'm cool with
 
05:12:22.590 --> 05:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
that less money more experiments thank
 
05:12:24.030 --> 05:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
you there you go that's right
 
05:12:27.948 --> 05:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
representative Canon Mr chair thank you
 
05:12:30.270 --> 05:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative for
 
05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's a simple
 
05:12:37.070 --> 05:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
question why New Hampshire why should we
 
05:12:39.830 --> 05:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
SP make this expenditure why aren't we
 
05:12:41.910 --> 05:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
working with other organizations and
 
05:12:45.628 --> 05:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
consortiums to fund a much larger study
 
05:12:48.270 --> 05:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
than the $4 million you're asking for
 
05:12:51.510 --> 05:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
over the next two years to do this um I
 
05:12:53.788 --> 05:12:53.798 align:start position:0%
I find it hard to believe that people
 
05:12:55.990 --> 05:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
aren't asking this question all across
 
05:12:58.590 --> 05:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
the country and that large donors would
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
be available to fund such a study
 
05:13:06.190 --> 05:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
but why should we the state of New
 
05:13:09.070 --> 05:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our taxpayers put this
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
money forward when it should be done on
 
05:13:14.150 --> 05:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
a larger scale and hopefully industry
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
would fund such a
 
05:13:18.510 --> 05:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
study well thank you for the question
 
05:13:20.270 --> 05:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative Canon
 
05:13:23.030 --> 05:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh the monies that are proposed being
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
used are monies that have the state has
 
05:13:30.070 --> 05:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
received uh via covid relief so there
 
05:13:32.110 --> 05:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
would be no additional burden placed on
 
05:13:34.110 --> 05:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
us we are already the greatest
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
contributors as taxpayers so we are
 
05:13:38.750 --> 05:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
basically taking money that we've
 
05:13:41.470 --> 05:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
already paid uh and we're going to put
 
05:13:45.150 --> 05:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
it to the use of this for the purpose of
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
the state of New hampsh to benefit the
 
05:13:48.430 --> 05:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire why should the
 
05:13:50.470 --> 05:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire do this why
 
05:13:52.990 --> 05:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
should we wait for someone else to do it
 
05:13:54.390 --> 05:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
let's be on The Cutting Edge Let's be
 
05:13:56.310 --> 05:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
the ones to lead the pack maybe then
 
05:13:57.670 --> 05:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
somebody else will say hey we'll do it
 
05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
too maybe some industry will come along
 
05:14:01.788 --> 05:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
and say Hey I want to do that too I I
 
05:14:04.110 --> 05:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
don't know science science scientific
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
experiments lead to other scientific
 
05:14:07.548 --> 05:14:07.558 align:start position:0%
breakthroughs and discoveries and so
 
05:14:09.708 --> 05:14:09.718 align:start position:0%
that's the beauty of science so why not
 
05:14:12.150 --> 05:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
start why not leave the pack why wait on
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
someone else to do
 
05:14:18.270 --> 05:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:20.590 --> 05:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
Merchant I think represent pushman had
 
05:14:25.868 --> 05:14:25.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:30.548 --> 05:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
first um thank you representative gon um
 
05:14:32.948 --> 05:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
my question was
 
05:14:35.948 --> 05:14:35.958 align:start position:0%
in regards to ensuring that there isn't
 
05:14:39.310 --> 05:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
bias in the studies conducted in the
 
05:14:39.320 --> 05:14:40.270 align:start position:0%
bias in the studies conducted in the
research

05:14:40.270 --> 05:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
research
 
05:14:46.350 --> 05:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
conducted um and I see that on page two
 
05:14:49.230 --> 05:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
line 17 that the department adopts the
 
05:14:51.548 --> 05:14:51.558 align:start position:0%
rules and I'm I'm assuming that that's
 
05:14:53.150 --> 05:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
referring to the Department of Health
 
05:14:56.310 --> 05:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
and Human Services since this is
 
05:14:59.230 --> 05:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
141c um so the Department of Health and
 
05:14:59.240 --> 05:15:00.070 align:start position:0%
141c um so the Department of Health and
Human

05:15:00.070 --> 05:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
Human
 
05:15:02.990 --> 05:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
Services adopts rules relative to the
 
05:15:05.030 --> 05:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
administration of the research grant
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
program including the application
 
05:15:09.190 --> 05:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
procedure eligibility criteria Grant
 
05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
dispersement and Reporting
 
05:15:14.470 --> 05:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
requirements and um do you trust the
 
05:15:15.910 --> 05:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
to be unbiased in
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
that uh I would like
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
to I I I want
 
05:15:28.110 --> 05:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
to um I I think I think about the
 
05:15:30.390 --> 05:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
research that I have done and and
 
05:15:32.990 --> 05:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
confronting um uh some of my professors
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
when I was at Naval Postgraduate School
 
05:15:37.510 --> 05:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
earning my Master's Degree I mentioned
 
05:15:39.948 --> 05:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:15:42.270 --> 05:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
money is real good at
 
05:15:45.270 --> 05:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
corrupting and that you can get whatever
 
05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
you pay
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
for and he didn't like that statement
 
05:15:52.470 --> 05:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
calling it very cynical uh but he was
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
also one who was published saying that
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
the uh the polar ice cap would be
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
completely melted by September of
 
05:16:02.270 --> 05:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
2013 and I asked him so what who cares
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
there's I've got a picture from a
 
05:16:06.270 --> 05:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
submarine taken in 1951 or 1952 with the
 
05:16:09.788 --> 05:16:09.798 align:start position:0%
caption where's the ice uh and so it's
 
05:16:11.708 --> 05:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
happened before in the past why should
 
05:16:12.990 --> 05:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
we care if it happens again in the
 
05:16:14.390 --> 05:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
future and it's just a question not
 
05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
trying to be a smart alec um but I think
 
05:16:20.270 --> 05:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
money can uh can corrupt this as
 
05:16:21.868 --> 05:16:21.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's a risk we should be
 
05:16:24.590 --> 05:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
willing to take uh that's why you have
 
05:16:27.750 --> 05:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
multiple people conducting the study uh
 
05:16:32.948 --> 05:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
it you have to have one Ru maker uh if
 
05:16:36.430 --> 05:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
it's the the the entity in the State uh
 
05:16:37.548 --> 05:16:37.558 align:start position:0%
is the Department of Health and Human
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
Services I would like to believe that
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
they would conduct this in and again
 
05:16:43.230 --> 05:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
they're auditable they're accountable to
 
05:16:46.070 --> 05:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
this body right here and as as it should
 
05:16:48.868 --> 05:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
be uh and so if we believe that they are
 
05:16:50.628 --> 05:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
misappropriating or they're mishandling
 
05:16:52.070 --> 05:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
or they're misguiding or anything like
 
05:16:53.310 --> 05:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
that we have the ability to put the
 
05:16:56.750 --> 05:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
so I hope that answers your
 
05:17:00.400 --> 05:17:02.470 align:start position:0%
so I hope that answers your
question

05:17:02.470 --> 05:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:17:04.830 --> 05:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
05:17:05.788 --> 05:17:05.798 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for the
 
05:17:07.350 --> 05:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
considerations representative
 
05:17:10.470 --> 05:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
pishman Mr sorry representative a
 
05:17:12.390 --> 05:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
question in regards to I'm not a
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
researcher um although spent some time
 
05:17:16.510 --> 05:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
in a research lab but not really doing
 
05:17:19.628 --> 05:17:19.638 align:start position:0%
the research so that's my claim to fame
 
05:17:22.230 --> 05:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
and research but in saying that one of
 
05:17:24.190 --> 05:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
the things I'm looking at is some can
 
05:17:26.190 --> 05:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
help me or maybe you can help me as
 
05:17:28.990 --> 05:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
well the organs that you're going to or
 
05:17:31.788 --> 05:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
proposing someone do the research on how
 
05:17:33.190 --> 05:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
are they going to be obtained and the
 
05:17:34.590 --> 05:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
reason I asked the question we've gone
 
05:17:36.750 --> 05:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
through a lot of histor this morning
 
05:17:40.030 --> 05:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
about patient consent and therefore how
 
05:17:42.590 --> 05:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
do we get patients consent to donate the
 
05:17:45.628 --> 05:17:45.638 align:start position:0%
Oregon to this cause and if we do that
 
05:17:46.868 --> 05:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
how are we going ensure that we have
 
05:17:49.470 --> 05:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
some sort of a balanced approach to it
 
05:17:51.910 --> 05:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
because I want to be sure that we have
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
patients on both sides of the aisle be
 
05:17:55.350 --> 05:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
well vaccinated unvaccinated consenting
 
05:17:57.470 --> 05:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
to it so as a non- researcher can you
 
05:18:00.750 --> 05:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
help me explain how that would be done
 
05:18:02.948 --> 05:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
in such a way is not
 
05:18:05.230 --> 05:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
biased well thank you for your question
 
05:18:06.990 --> 05:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
that is what
 
05:18:09.820 --> 05:18:09.830 align:start position:0%
researchers uh that would
 
05:18:09.830 --> 05:18:10.948 align:start position:0%
researchers uh that would
[Music]

05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:18:13.230 --> 05:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
be I mean how do they conduct scientific
 
05:18:16.470 --> 05:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
research now on on anything they have to
 
05:18:20.230 --> 05:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
be able to acquire the specimens uh
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
people donate their bodies to science
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
frequently I don't know how many that is
 
05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
but it occurs it's it's how we develop
 
05:18:29.628 --> 05:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
uh Cancer Treatments it's how we develop
 
05:18:33.430 --> 05:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
new technologies for you name it and so
 
05:18:37.590 --> 05:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
the availability should be there um
 
05:18:40.230 --> 05:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
Others May because they know about this
 
05:18:43.390 --> 05:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
may may want to specifically uh donate
 
05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
for this particular cause um so that
 
05:18:50.430 --> 05:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
would just be part of the the recipient
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the grant would have to be able to
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
acquire acquire by whatever means that
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
they presently would get their their
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:03.670 --> 05:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
now representative Woods uh thank you Mr
 
05:19:05.788 --> 05:19:05.798 align:start position:0%
chair there actually a question for you
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
will we uh will we be hearing from HHS
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh today regarding this matter I didn't
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
hear the last part but the first part
 
05:19:18.030 --> 05:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
was will we be adjourning from HHS today
 
05:19:23.190 --> 05:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:25.788 --> 05:19:25.798 align:start position:0%
that will we be hearing from the
 
05:19:29.390 --> 05:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
Department today regarding this matter
 
05:19:32.110 --> 05:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
that's a yes
 
05:19:32.120 --> 05:19:32.830 align:start position:0%
that's a yes
thank

05:19:32.830 --> 05:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:19:35.628 --> 05:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:19:39.070 --> 05:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
kerk yes I I was curious are you aware
 
05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
of any other basic research which is
 
05:19:44.350 --> 05:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
funded at the state level and
 
05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
administered by
 
05:19:48.788 --> 05:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
DHHS I'm not aware of any other research
 
05:19:53.788 --> 05:19:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:19:59.670 --> 05:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chairman because I
 
05:20:01.948 --> 05:20:01.958 align:start position:0%
think I would just got under the on that
 
05:20:01.958 --> 05:20:03.510 align:start position:0%
think I would just got under the on that
one

05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:20:05.788 --> 05:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
louder thank you Mr chairman because I
 
05:20:07.310 --> 05:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
think I just got under the wire on that
 
05:20:10.110 --> 05:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
one you did and thank you rep uh
 
05:20:13.270 --> 05:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative for uh taking my question
 
05:20:16.548 --> 05:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
and it may just be um more of the same
 
05:20:21.070 --> 05:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
questions the underlying current here it
 
05:20:22.708 --> 05:20:22.718 align:start position:0%
um when I'm thinking of Grants I'm
 
05:20:25.150 --> 05:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
thinking of money that's available and
 
05:20:26.750 --> 05:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where the grant money comes
 
05:20:29.708 --> 05:20:29.718 align:start position:0%
from to be quite honest with you um but
 
05:20:32.190 --> 05:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering why we need
 
05:20:36.910 --> 05:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
legislation in order to do a study to um
 
05:20:38.830 --> 05:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
to sort through all the fake news that
 
05:20:40.948 --> 05:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
we get and that's on both sides by the
 
05:20:47.628 --> 05:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:51.030 --> 05:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative the desire
 
05:20:51.040 --> 05:20:54.350 align:start position:0%
representative the desire
here

05:20:54.350 --> 05:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:58.030 --> 05:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
is everyone has a vested interest in in
 
05:21:01.110 --> 05:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
knowing the answer whatever answer
 
05:21:02.708 --> 05:21:02.718 align:start position:0%
answers come
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:14.830 --> 05:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:18.030 --> 05:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
the I don't see anyone presently at at
 
05:21:20.070 --> 05:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
any of our state universities or at
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth or anywhere else saying hey
 
05:21:26.510 --> 05:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
can we conduct a scientific study for
 
05:21:28.990 --> 05:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
this purpose I've not seen any
 
05:21:31.030 --> 05:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
volunteers sometimes you need to
 
05:21:34.230 --> 05:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
stimulate to get the
 
05:21:36.510 --> 05:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers U that's
 
05:21:40.150 --> 05:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh to to to do that you're you are
 
05:21:40.160 --> 05:21:41.948 align:start position:0%
okay uh to to to do that you're you are
incentivizing

05:21:41.948 --> 05:21:41.958 align:start position:0%
incentivizing
 
05:21:45.270 --> 05:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
study and uh and that's okay to do that
 
05:21:47.830 --> 05:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh so that's why if there were another
 
05:21:50.190 --> 05:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
way if if the department uh were to say
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
we're going to take some of our uh covid
 
05:21:53.990 --> 05:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
relief funds and put if the governor
 
05:21:56.628 --> 05:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
were to say gee I'd sure like to have a
 
05:21:58.990 --> 05:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
a study conducted is there another way
 
05:22:01.110 --> 05:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
of doing this I'm sure there probably is
 
05:22:03.670 --> 05:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
is uh but at this point in time this is
 
05:22:06.310 --> 05:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
the vehicle that I'm aware of uh to to
 
05:22:08.190 --> 05:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
be able to accomplish this goal again we
 
05:22:12.230 --> 05:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
we are we all have a a u a vested
 
05:22:15.470 --> 05:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
interest in knowing what the reality of
 
05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
this is and so we can put monies that
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
we've already uh spent through our tax
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
dollars that are now coming back to us
 
05:22:26.030 --> 05:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
that we can allocate for the purposes
 
05:22:28.150 --> 05:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
that we desire and this would be
 
05:22:30.270 --> 05:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
something that we could put toward that
 
05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
so the the funding is from uh from Co
 
05:22:35.230 --> 05:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
relief funds you asked that question a
 
05:22:38.390 --> 05:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
minute ago so representative did you
 
05:22:43.230 --> 05:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
investigate to see if other states or
 
05:22:45.628 --> 05:22:45.638 align:start position:0%
universities around the country are
 
05:22:48.030 --> 05:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
launching similar studies I have not
 
05:22:50.910 --> 05:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
found any other state official state
 
05:22:53.670 --> 05:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
actions and I have not found any uh what
 
05:22:57.830 --> 05:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm able to find are uh the results of
 
05:22:57.840 --> 05:22:58.910 align:start position:0%
I'm able to find are uh the results of
studies

05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
studies
 
05:23:01.350 --> 05:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
conducted U as they are published by the
 
05:23:02.548 --> 05:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
National Institutes for health or
 
05:23:04.868 --> 05:23:04.878 align:start position:0%
something else but I've not found
 
05:23:04.878 --> 05:23:06.310 align:start position:0%
something else but I've not found
anything

05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:23:10.030 --> 05:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
specifically that uh proposed or that's
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
underway a lot of times they don't tell
 
05:23:13.628 --> 05:23:13.638 align:start position:0%
you what's underway they wait until they
 
05:23:16.110 --> 05:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
have the uh pre peer reviewed they may
 
05:23:17.990 --> 05:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
release something and then it becomes
 
05:23:20.310 --> 05:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
peer reviewed after that but uh but I've
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
not found anything specifically the
 
05:23:25.590 --> 05:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
effects on the human body of if any uh
 
05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
of uh covid vaccines so i' I've not
 
05:23:29.470 --> 05:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
found anything like that in in any
 
05:23:31.190 --> 05:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
University or state if there out there
 
05:23:32.868 --> 05:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
I'm just not aware of it let's reverse
 
05:23:35.708 --> 05:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
the flow how widely have you told other
 
05:23:38.670 --> 05:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
legislators what you hope to do
 
05:23:42.190 --> 05:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
here I didn't know I would be on WMU I
 
05:23:43.510 --> 05:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
thought this was pretty going to be a
 
05:23:45.470 --> 05:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
pretty boring Bill to be quite honest
 
05:23:46.590 --> 05:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
with you nothing's boring in this
 
05:23:49.868 --> 05:23:49.878 align:start position:0%
committee I love you guys this is great
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh I've got a great face for radio by
 
05:23:54.070 --> 05:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
the way
 
05:23:57.548 --> 05:23:57.558 align:start position:0%
um uh I actually did not share this with
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
but just a handful of Representatives
 
05:24:02.750 --> 05:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
just to get a feel for if there would be
 
05:24:05.430 --> 05:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
a desire for anything like this and the
 
05:24:08.190 --> 05:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
feedback that I got was pretty positive
 
05:24:11.708 --> 05:24:11.718 align:start position:0%
uh the the I I did have help uh from one
 
05:24:13.030 --> 05:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
of our fellow representatives in
 
05:24:15.788 --> 05:24:15.798 align:start position:0%
crafting the wording of the bill as he
 
05:24:19.270 --> 05:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
has uh he's actually a a microbiologist
 
05:24:21.990 --> 05:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
so it's that helped to uh to kind of get
 
05:24:23.830 --> 05:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
my thinking about how to go about but he
 
05:24:26.470 --> 05:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
he's done research grants and both
 
05:24:28.990 --> 05:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
applying for and and writing research
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
grants so to get some of that techn
 
05:24:32.910 --> 05:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
technical wording uh that needed to be
 
05:24:36.548 --> 05:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
in there and so um but as far as
 
05:24:38.110 --> 05:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
spreading it around asking for other
 
05:24:39.670 --> 05:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors I thought this was kind of a
 
05:24:42.750 --> 05:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
boring bill so I didn't even
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
ask representative Shapiro I believe you
 
05:24:46.750 --> 05:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
had your hand
 
05:24:49.390 --> 05:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
up you didn't oh you're waving off okay
 
05:24:51.788 --> 05:24:51.798 align:start position:0%
anyone else for representative yes
 
05:24:51.798 --> 05:24:55.788 align:start position:0%
anyone else for representative yes
representative

05:24:55.788 --> 05:24:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:59.548 --> 05:24:59.558 align:start position:0%
McKay um I am obviously very concerned
 
05:25:01.470 --> 05:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
about this two minut
 
05:25:05.470 --> 05:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
dollar and where it's coming from the uh
 
05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
department is a huge department and has
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
concerns in many different parts of that
 
05:25:15.708 --> 05:25:15.718 align:start position:0%
department my interest is in mental
 
05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
health it's
 
05:25:19.390 --> 05:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
extremely uh
 
05:25:22.110 --> 05:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
underfunded and and you take out any one
 
05:25:24.910 --> 05:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
part of it it upsets the whole
 
05:25:27.708 --> 05:25:27.718 align:start position:0%
system so that I don't know if you've
 
05:25:30.150 --> 05:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
talked to the department about this 2
 
05:25:30.160 --> 05:25:31.628 align:start position:0%
talked to the department about this 2
million

05:25:31.628 --> 05:25:31.638 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:25:33.708 --> 05:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
uh at all and I take it we're going to
 
05:25:37.070 --> 05:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
hear from the department but that
 
05:25:41.590 --> 05:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
concerns me uh significantly to take
 
05:25:45.230 --> 05:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
that much money away from the department
 
05:25:48.390 --> 05:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
and what what will be lost in the
 
05:25:52.868 --> 05:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
process is a major concern for me thank
 
05:25:54.990 --> 05:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative in your
 
05:25:58.430 --> 05:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
concerns I I share your concerns that's
 
05:26:02.590 --> 05:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
why uh the the monies for this grant
 
05:26:04.430 --> 05:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
would not be taken out of the
 
05:26:07.708 --> 05:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
Department's regular budget uh it's
 
05:26:10.990 --> 05:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
monies that are uh allocated to the
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh pursuant to
 
05:26:15.590 --> 05:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
the American Rescue plan Act of
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
2021 uh and the and and will be
 
05:26:23.110 --> 05:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated uh to to ensure that we can
 
05:26:25.350 --> 05:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
actually uh use the funds for that
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
purpose if federal law tells us we can't
 
05:26:31.110 --> 05:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh even do this uh which I not seen
 
05:26:33.390 --> 05:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
anything in in the law I look to see if
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
this would be be out would not be
 
05:26:36.548 --> 05:26:36.558 align:start position:0%
allowed and I've not found anything to
 
05:26:39.310 --> 05:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
say that it couldn't be but if somebody
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
you know an attorney wanted to kill this
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
they could probably find some vague
 
05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
wording uh to to uh get it uh get it
 
05:26:51.270 --> 05:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
destroyed here uh but the the monies
 
05:26:54.788 --> 05:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
would would come from that money not
 
05:26:56.670 --> 05:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
anything that's that's that's already
 
05:26:58.510 --> 05:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
budgeted in the state budget so there
 
05:27:01.548 --> 05:27:01.558 align:start position:0%
would no be no adverse effect
 
05:27:04.590 --> 05:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
uh on the department in that regard so
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
it literally comes down to the monies
 
05:27:08.470 --> 05:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
that we are receiving from from oura
 
05:27:10.590 --> 05:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
funds we're going to take a portion of
 
05:27:12.990 --> 05:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
that for this purpose if federal law
 
05:27:15.310 --> 05:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
says we can't do this then it's all
 
05:27:19.070 --> 05:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
mooded and any money that's not spent
 
05:27:25.310 --> 05:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:28.708 --> 05:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
budget representative Leon thank you Mr
 
05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative gson
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
um would you agree that this whole
 
05:27:35.670 --> 05:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination vaccination process is
 
05:27:38.110 --> 05:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
probably going to drag off drag on for
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
over a year and that this data if it
 
05:27:43.190 --> 05:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
were to find no significant difference
 
05:27:45.230 --> 05:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
would overcome a lot of objections that
 
05:27:48.868 --> 05:27:48.878 align:start position:0%
people have to receiving it yes actually
 
05:27:51.030 --> 05:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative that's that's a a great
 
05:27:53.310 --> 05:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
observation that I I was hoping to make
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
before I finished here uh we hear the
 
05:27:59.708 --> 05:27:59.718 align:start position:0%
term vaccine hesitant or vaccine
 
05:28:02.910 --> 05:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
resistant or whatever like that this is
 
05:28:05.788 --> 05:28:05.798 align:start position:0%
this is not coming from any anti-vax
 
05:28:09.190 --> 05:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
position this is a pro- science position
 
05:28:12.150 --> 05:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
period but I do believe that when we
 
05:28:15.510 --> 05:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
learn the truth of what's happening if
 
05:28:17.670 --> 05:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
there's any at all I think it would have
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
a very positive effect on people one way
 
05:28:24.590 --> 05:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
or the other either there I think it was
 
05:28:26.590 --> 05:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
pointed out a little bit ago uh about
 
05:28:30.110 --> 05:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
the uh uh contention about this this uh
 
05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
about this this subject and a part of
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
that is because we've not had the free
 
05:28:39.948 --> 05:28:39.958 align:start position:0%
flow of of be of truthful information a
 
05:28:42.110 --> 05:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
lot of information has been concealed
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's been spun one way or the other and
 
05:28:46.510 --> 05:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
it's just not the right way to go about
 
05:28:48.990 --> 05:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
making decisions the proper way so I
 
05:28:50.910 --> 05:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
think this will settle a lot of fears
 
05:28:53.310 --> 05:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
that people may still have one way or
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
the other so I'm not pushing a pro
 
05:28:58.470 --> 05:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine or antivaccine it's not I'm not
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
pushing one way or the other I'm pushing
 
05:29:03.390 --> 05:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
scientific discovery that's it
 
05:29:06.628 --> 05:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
representative would you agree with me
 
05:29:09.990 --> 05:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
that we are not just looking for an
 
05:29:12.830 --> 05:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
objective answer to the question about
 
05:29:16.750 --> 05:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
covid we may be defending science here
 
05:29:18.830 --> 05:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
because one of the casualties in this
 
05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic where I sit is the whole
 
05:29:25.990 --> 05:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
question of what is science can we trust
 
05:29:28.750 --> 05:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
science it's been hijacked or it's being
 
05:29:31.270 --> 05:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
attempted to be hijacked by numbers of
 
05:29:33.708 --> 05:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
parties across the Spectrum and an
 
05:29:37.310 --> 05:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
objective study on this issue may have
 
05:29:41.030 --> 05:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
the added benefit of rescuing science
 
05:29:43.990 --> 05:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
would you agree I wholeheartedly agree
 
05:29:46.910 --> 05:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing that out uh again
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
I I I'm my scientific experience is in
 
05:29:52.190 --> 05:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
meteorology and oceanography so I get to
 
05:29:54.430 --> 05:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
deal with climate change right and if
 
05:29:57.750 --> 05:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
you even ask a question you get called
 
05:29:59.350 --> 05:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
to the principal's office I was teaching
 
05:30:01.190 --> 05:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
at Plymouth state University and all I
 
05:30:04.628 --> 05:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
did was prompt the students to ask
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
questions don't just take what you hear
 
05:30:08.948 --> 05:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
on the news
 
05:30:13.990 --> 05:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
as the gospel study it out ask questions
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
next thing you know I'm talking to the
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
chair of the department did you calling
 
05:30:19.310 --> 05:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
to question climate change I said no I
 
05:30:21.190 --> 05:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
got the students to start
 
05:30:24.350 --> 05:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
thinking that's what science does yes
 
05:30:27.590 --> 05:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
and science is being hijacked terribly
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
so let's bring it back thank you any
 
05:30:30.240 --> 05:30:33.070 align:start position:0%
so let's bring it back thank you any
anyone

05:30:33.070 --> 05:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:37.310 --> 05:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
else thank you representative thank
 
05:30:39.910 --> 05:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
you we've got the department to answer
 
05:30:42.150 --> 05:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
some questions for us but first I'd like
 
05:30:45.070 --> 05:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
to call on James Stewart we've had Mr
 
05:30:48.390 --> 05:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
Stewart here earlier today and from a
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
non-scientist point of view but just a
 
05:30:54.110 --> 05:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
guy I thought you spoke quite eloquently
 
05:30:55.628 --> 05:30:55.638 align:start position:0%
and you've asked to speak for two to
 
05:30:59.628 --> 05:30:59.638 align:start position:0%
three minutes and go for it thank you
 
05:31:01.590 --> 05:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
now that I've heard a lot that I didn't
 
05:31:02.948 --> 05:31:02.958 align:start position:0%
know exactly what was going to come up
 
05:31:06.830 --> 05:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
i' surely like about 15 but uh you could
 
05:31:08.830 --> 05:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
come back next week you well if you can
 
05:31:10.750 --> 05:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
extend it to Five I'll be happy but you
 
05:31:13.548 --> 05:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
nail you thank you sir you nailed it
 
05:31:15.548 --> 05:31:15.558 align:start position:0%
right there science needs to be defended
 
05:31:19.070 --> 05:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
be defended is not a shame science is
 
05:31:21.708 --> 05:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
science science is truth science is
 
05:31:23.788 --> 05:31:23.798 align:start position:0%
facts science is the investigation of
 
05:31:23.798 --> 05:31:24.548 align:start position:0%
facts science is the investigation of
the

05:31:24.548 --> 05:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:27.270 --> 05:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
world and you discover what's there and
 
05:31:28.910 --> 05:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
what's there is what's there you don't
 
05:31:31.350 --> 05:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
turn it into politics or twisted
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
around part of the problem here is that
 
05:31:36.510 --> 05:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
we don't understand enough
 
05:31:40.350 --> 05:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
about we don't understand the fact that
 
05:31:44.590 --> 05:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
this genetic therapy inoculation that is
 
05:31:47.470 --> 05:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
happening in the world and that is being
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
actually pushed by the DHHS of New
 
05:31:52.430 --> 05:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when they come up here
 
05:31:53.830 --> 05:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to be representing their
 
05:31:56.030 --> 05:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
dollars they want their dollars and
 
05:31:57.510 --> 05:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
they've got their agenda and that's all
 
05:31:58.948 --> 05:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
they're going to want they don't want it
 
05:32:00.750 --> 05:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
they want s they want science out there
 
05:32:02.590 --> 05:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
they don't want facts and facts careful
 
05:32:04.590 --> 05:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
careful I'm saying what I believe is the
 
05:32:06.350 --> 05:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
truth I understand that and here's
 
05:32:09.190 --> 05:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
another truth point of order Mr chair
 
05:32:12.510 --> 05:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
yes point of order is it not our
 
05:32:17.270 --> 05:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
practice and procedure that you may not
 
05:32:21.150 --> 05:32:21.160 align:start position:0%
State what you may not
 
05:32:23.708 --> 05:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
cast we don't presume to know what we
 
05:32:26.510 --> 05:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
cannot presume someone else's motivation
 
05:32:29.310 --> 05:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct you can you can State
 
05:32:31.470 --> 05:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
your own thoughts but not presume
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
someone else's motivation okay I'll mend
 
05:32:35.590 --> 05:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
that too that my thoughts are that
 
05:32:37.270 --> 05:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's probably going to Happ time will
 
05:32:41.390 --> 05:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
tell um so one thing we need to
 
05:32:44.230 --> 05:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
understand is that this is not a vaccine
 
05:32:46.510 --> 05:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
everybody keeps calling it vaccine it's
 
05:32:47.948 --> 05:32:47.958 align:start position:0%
not a
 
05:32:51.470 --> 05:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine and the CDC totally agreed with
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
that up until about 30 days ago when
 
05:32:56.830 --> 05:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
without your knowledge without making
 
05:32:59.548 --> 05:32:59.558 align:start position:0%
much a awareness of it to the media or
 
05:33:03.548 --> 05:33:03.558 align:start position:0%
anyone else very quietly the CDC changed
 
05:33:06.470 --> 05:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
the definition of vaccine did you know
 
05:33:09.070 --> 05:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
that no probably most of you didn't
 
05:33:11.948 --> 05:33:11.958 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion by the way probably
 
05:33:13.910 --> 05:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
most of you didn't we're going to be
 
05:33:15.788 --> 05:33:15.798 align:start position:0%
discussing that at some point continue
 
05:33:20.190 --> 05:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
please so what they did is it used timeh
 
05:33:23.070 --> 05:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
honored definition of vaccine was that
 
05:33:25.750 --> 05:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
which immunizes you but now it's so
 
05:33:28.750 --> 05:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
obvious that the vaccine is not safe and
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
not effective
 
05:33:32.430 --> 05:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't immunize you you need a
 
05:33:33.990 --> 05:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
booster how many here have to have a
 
05:33:37.030 --> 05:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
booster of small poox
 
05:33:40.390 --> 05:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
diptheria tetus once every 10 years you
 
05:33:42.990 --> 05:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
know 10 years it's not like every three
 
05:33:45.708 --> 05:33:45.718 align:start position:0%
months it's not like multiple boosters
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
like they're going to keep making money
 
05:33:49.948 --> 05:33:49.958 align:start position:0%
on and the answer there is follow the
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
money Trail as far as the 75 years for
 
05:33:55.310 --> 05:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
the FDA to bring this out it's the FDA
 
05:33:58.548 --> 05:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
by the way um that is says this going to
 
05:34:01.110 --> 05:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
take 75 years why here's the here's the
 
05:34:04.150 --> 05:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
short answer mostly money they don't
 
05:34:06.190 --> 05:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
want to bring this out they're
 
05:34:08.590 --> 05:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
obfuscating it's totally apparent to
 
05:34:09.830 --> 05:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
everybody involved that that's what
 
05:34:10.830 --> 05:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing they could bring this out
 
05:34:13.788 --> 05:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
in 75 hours if they wanted to certainly
 
05:34:17.910 --> 05:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
75 days 75 years is just saying oh we we
 
05:34:18.910 --> 05:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
really don't want to bring it out
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
because we don't want the truth
 
05:34:22.948 --> 05:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
known as far as something else you need
 
05:34:24.670 --> 05:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
to understand that's diabolical about
 
05:34:27.030 --> 05:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
this the spike protein that we need to
 
05:34:28.230 --> 05:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
discover more about and this is the
 
05:34:29.948 --> 05:34:29.958 align:start position:0%
reason we need to Discover it this
 
05:34:35.030 --> 05:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't totally made clear um this what
 
05:34:37.628 --> 05:34:37.638 align:start position:0%
this genetic therapy solution is it it
 
05:34:39.788 --> 05:34:39.798 align:start position:0%
it involves an
 
05:34:42.110 --> 05:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
encapsulated alterate
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
alterating Gene alterating um entity
 
05:34:50.750 --> 05:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's encapsulated in a what's a uh a
 
05:34:53.310 --> 05:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
lipid nanop particle it's a very small
 
05:34:54.990 --> 05:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
particle that's allowed to get into your
 
05:34:58.548 --> 05:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
cells because it uses a a fat coating
 
05:34:59.868 --> 05:34:59.878 align:start position:0%
because it gets into your cells more
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
easily that way because your cells are
 
05:35:04.990 --> 05:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
covered with fat when it when it accepts
 
05:35:09.190 --> 05:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
this it causes your cell this is what
 
05:35:10.150 --> 05:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
05:35:13.070 --> 05:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
understood this genetic therapy causes
 
05:35:14.548 --> 05:35:14.558 align:start position:0%
your cell and every one of you who's
 
05:35:17.230 --> 05:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated is consented to be part
 
05:35:19.310 --> 05:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
of this worldwide trial this big
 
05:35:22.628 --> 05:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
experiment because it causes your cell
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
to make the spike protein no it's not
 
05:35:26.788 --> 05:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
just a spike protein that comes from the
 
05:35:30.470 --> 05:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
covid-19 infection itself you are making
 
05:35:33.628 --> 05:35:33.638 align:start position:0%
Spike protein with your cells it's been
 
05:35:36.190 --> 05:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
caused to happen by this therapy two
 
05:35:36.200 --> 05:35:37.830 align:start position:0%
caused to happen by this therapy two
minutes

05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:35:40.990 --> 05:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
okay when that happens it floods your
 
05:35:44.110 --> 05:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
system with these Spike protein thereby
 
05:35:48.030 --> 05:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
poisoning you the thought was that you
 
05:35:50.548 --> 05:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
would react to this Spike protein and
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
make antibodies it might happen somewhat
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
but they didn't count on that this Spike
 
05:35:57.070 --> 05:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
protein goes all over the place in your
 
05:35:59.230 --> 05:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
body it's and the lipid neop particle
 
05:36:00.190 --> 05:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
gets to
 
05:36:02.510 --> 05:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
deposited also the Japanese have shown
 
05:36:04.390 --> 05:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
that it goes into mostly women's ovaries
 
05:36:06.190 --> 05:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
and into the marrow of your blood of
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
your bones but it gets deposited in lots
 
05:36:12.510 --> 05:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
of places and when it when this mRNA
 
05:36:16.150 --> 05:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
altering Factor goes into cells it was
 
05:36:18.430 --> 05:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to stay in your muscle cells in
 
05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
your arm it didn't sometimes it travels
 
05:36:23.910 --> 05:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
in your your Venus system throughout
 
05:36:26.230 --> 05:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
your entire bodies especially when it
 
05:36:28.110 --> 05:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
against in the very small cap litters
 
05:36:30.190 --> 05:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
when it makes the spike protein it goes
 
05:36:32.788 --> 05:36:32.798 align:start position:0%
in the very your body makes it these
 
05:36:34.628 --> 05:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
Spike proteins locate in your very small
 
05:36:36.190 --> 05:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
capillaries and plug them up that's what
 
05:36:38.590 --> 05:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
causes some of the the the blood plots
 
05:36:39.910 --> 05:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
I'm hurrying here because I've only got
 
05:36:43.390 --> 05:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
so much time and the spike protein
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
sometime is grown in various cells that
 
05:36:50.110 --> 05:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
cause your body to attack it because it
 
05:36:51.948 --> 05:36:51.958 align:start position:0%
knows it's a foreign particle when this
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
happens it causes some of the partis and
 
05:36:56.628 --> 05:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
and myotis and things like that that's
 
05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
why these these these uh Athletes World
 
05:37:03.190 --> 05:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
known athletes are just I've literally
 
05:37:06.310 --> 05:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
seen many pictures of them just falling
 
05:37:08.750 --> 05:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
over dead we're going to find out more
 
05:37:12.150 --> 05:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
and more about this and it's a shame
 
05:37:14.470 --> 05:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
that we have to need our own scientific
 
05:37:16.390 --> 05:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
study in the state of New Hampshire 30
 
05:37:18.750 --> 05:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
seconds to to prove that there's
 
05:37:18.760 --> 05:37:20.070 align:start position:0%
seconds to to prove that there's
something

05:37:20.070 --> 05:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
nefarious that's a light word going on
 
05:37:25.390 --> 05:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
here because there's lots of study out
 
05:37:28.430 --> 05:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
there The Hope here is folks that if we
 
05:37:31.270 --> 05:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
have our own maybe we'll hear about it
 
05:37:32.830 --> 05:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
maybe you folks will hear about it maybe
 
05:37:34.548 --> 05:37:34.558 align:start position:0%
more people will be hearing about the
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
negative effects of this so-called
 
05:37:40.470 --> 05:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine and at some point the Tipping
 
05:37:42.910 --> 05:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
Point will come where all of us will
 
05:37:45.310 --> 05:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
know more and more and more and thank
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
you so much thank you appreciate you
 
05:37:47.400 --> 05:37:50.390 align:start position:0%
you so much thank you appreciate you
coming

05:37:50.390 --> 05:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
back we now call on John Williams and
 
05:37:55.708 --> 05:37:55.718 align:start position:0%
Abby Rogers from the Department of
 
05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:58.520 --> 05:38:02.230 align:start position:0%
 
Services

05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:04.628 --> 05:38:04.638 align:start position:0%
and good afternoon uh chairman Pearson
 
05:38:06.670 --> 05:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee and I know
 
05:38:08.270 --> 05:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
this is the last bill of a day we're
 
05:38:10.310 --> 05:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
really primarily here to respond to
 
05:38:13.150 --> 05:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
questions uh I do want to uh introduce
 
05:38:15.788 --> 05:38:15.798 align:start position:0%
obviously Abby Rogers she's our she is
 
05:38:18.030 --> 05:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
our legislative lison for our division
 
05:38:19.628 --> 05:38:19.638 align:start position:0%
of Public Health and she actually
 
05:38:22.070 --> 05:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
assisted me and our financial managers
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
in conducting the financial review So to
 
05:38:25.948 --> 05:38:25.958 align:start position:0%
that extent we do have personal
 
05:38:28.628 --> 05:38:28.638 align:start position:0%
knowledge over the fiscal note that was
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
produced by the legis assed budget
 
05:38:32.750 --> 05:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
Assistance Office uh two people who are
 
05:38:35.548 --> 05:38:35.558 align:start position:0%
two of your members uh um who really
 
05:38:37.030 --> 05:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
stated something I think that was very
 
05:38:39.150 --> 05:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
helpful to this conversation were both
 
05:38:40.510 --> 05:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative Solway and also
 
05:38:42.628 --> 05:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
representative kushman represent Solway
 
05:38:44.750 --> 05:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
started off the conversation saying it
 
05:38:47.150 --> 05:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
is unique in you in in this proposed
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
Bill to approach a research project in
 
05:38:52.350 --> 05:38:52.360 align:start position:0%
the way that it's being presented here
 
05:38:54.430 --> 05:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh by um the representative who's
 
05:38:57.708 --> 05:38:57.718 align:start position:0%
sponsoring it and um and that is true to
 
05:39:00.350 --> 05:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
my knowledge we don't have specific
 
05:39:03.350 --> 05:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
types of procurements that we do for
 
05:39:05.868 --> 05:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
particular research and that actually um
 
05:39:08.310 --> 05:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
goes to represent kushman I I would use
 
05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
a slightly different word than trust uh
 
05:39:13.390 --> 05:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
and bias but I would absolutely agree
 
05:39:14.670 --> 05:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
with represent kushman in her
 
05:39:16.708 --> 05:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
observations that because this is not
 
05:39:19.430 --> 05:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
typically a role department does to my
 
05:39:20.990 --> 05:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge even another state agency
 
05:39:23.830 --> 05:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
similar to us doing this kind of pement
 
05:39:26.190 --> 05:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
for research that it does raise question
 
05:39:27.868 --> 05:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
should best be managed and I think that
 
05:39:29.868 --> 05:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
that's goes back to what re of Sol way
 
05:39:32.708 --> 05:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
started off in this conversation and and
 
05:39:34.590 --> 05:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
his questions that there is an
 
05:39:36.270 --> 05:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
established process you know whether
 
05:39:37.628 --> 05:39:37.638 align:start position:0%
through the National Institute of Health
 
05:39:40.750 --> 05:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
or others how you get to good science so
 
05:39:43.030 --> 05:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
although we can applaud the bill sponsor
 
05:39:45.030 --> 05:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
for coming up with a unique reproach for
 
05:39:47.468 --> 05:39:47.478 align:start position:0%
trying to fund such research it is
 
05:39:49.510 --> 05:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
something very vastly different and in
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
particularly could run into the issues
 
05:39:53.390 --> 05:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
that I think that representative kushman
 
05:39:55.510 --> 05:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
was identifying in her commentary and
 
05:39:57.548 --> 05:39:57.558 align:start position:0%
point in case is when we do a
 
05:39:59.590 --> 05:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
procurement as an agency we do quite a
 
05:40:01.708 --> 05:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
few procurements as an agency to devel
 
05:40:04.150 --> 05:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
to deliver services to the citizens of
 
05:40:05.590 --> 05:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have hundreds and
 
05:40:06.990 --> 05:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds of procurements that are out
 
05:40:08.910 --> 05:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
there and as we go through that process
 
05:40:10.788 --> 05:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
we're required by law to issue what they
 
05:40:13.030 --> 05:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
call a request for proposals those
 
05:40:15.190 --> 05:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals are designed
 
05:40:17.948 --> 05:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
specifically more for a service
 
05:40:20.788 --> 05:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
generating uh entity not to procure
 
05:40:23.868 --> 05:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
researchers to do research the other
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
concerns the other concerns it's not
 
05:40:27.070 --> 05:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
saying that it's limited that you
 
05:40:28.628 --> 05:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
couldn't use it for those vehicles but
 
05:40:31.830 --> 05:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
it is a unique approach to using our
 
05:40:34.708 --> 05:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
current RFP process also with requests
 
05:40:36.310 --> 05:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
for proposals as you're probably aware
 
05:40:38.948 --> 05:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
they go through the process of a review
 
05:40:40.990 --> 05:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
by governor and Council so it is
 
05:40:43.548 --> 05:40:43.558 align:start position:0%
bringing more into not only an executive
 
05:40:46.510 --> 05:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
branch agency to be in charge of putting
 
05:40:48.270 --> 05:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
together this research but also bringing
 
05:40:50.910 --> 05:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
in that process that has to play out
 
05:40:52.830 --> 05:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
with um with other types of contracts
 
05:40:54.948 --> 05:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
that have nothing to do with research so
 
05:40:56.468 --> 05:40:56.478 align:start position:0%
I do think it's an important point to
 
05:41:00.030 --> 05:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
raise in terms of who may be best uh
 
05:41:02.070 --> 05:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
suited to doing these kind of research
 
05:41:04.350 --> 05:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
and and it's tried and true the academic
 
05:41:06.788 --> 05:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
world the world that does research is
 
05:41:09.390 --> 05:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
really in a good position to doing this
 
05:41:11.110 --> 05:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
kind of work now one of the things that
 
05:41:13.070 --> 05:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
certainly we can follow up in addition
 
05:41:15.670 --> 05:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
to the request that was made of repr uh
 
05:41:17.510 --> 05:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
Reon to look at what other states are
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
doing we could certainly look to see
 
05:41:20.788 --> 05:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
what is out there in terms of current
 
05:41:22.350 --> 05:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
research on the subject matter to at
 
05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
least try to see if there's anything
 
05:41:25.868 --> 05:41:25.878 align:start position:0%
that we could offer uh to to this
 
05:41:28.468 --> 05:41:28.478 align:start position:0%
committee so uh going Beyond just the
 
05:41:30.670 --> 05:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
issue of the procurement process and
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
this just not being a well-fitted suit
 
05:41:36.468 --> 05:41:36.478 align:start position:0%
to doing research there is the issue of
 
05:41:38.590 --> 05:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
and it's one of my and I have to be just
 
05:41:40.948 --> 05:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
very direct one of my pet peeves lately
 
05:41:43.948 --> 05:41:43.958 align:start position:0%
over when we do fiscal analysis on bills
 
05:41:46.110 --> 05:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
that it's somehow couched in terms of an
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation when I think of an
 
05:41:49.070 --> 05:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation I think of general fund
 
05:41:51.390 --> 05:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that you the legislature
 
05:41:53.868 --> 05:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
provide to a state agency to be able to
 
05:41:56.190 --> 05:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
execute the work that's being requested
 
05:41:58.070 --> 05:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
and although I do appreciate the novel
 
05:42:01.270 --> 05:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
use of the uh arpa funds which uh are
 
05:42:03.788 --> 05:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
being discussed here those American
 
05:42:05.788 --> 05:42:05.798 align:start position:0%
Rescue plan act funds are actually
 
05:42:07.670 --> 05:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
administered through the governor's
 
05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
office of relief and recovery and they
 
05:42:13.150 --> 05:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
have a spef a very specific process
 
05:42:15.190 --> 05:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of this legislation
 
05:42:17.468 --> 05:42:17.478 align:start position:0%
for entities to make requests for those
 
05:42:19.230 --> 05:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
funds and those funds are totally
 
05:42:21.430 --> 05:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
Federal so you can't lapse those funds
 
05:42:22.948 --> 05:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
into the state general funds because
 
05:42:24.310 --> 05:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
there are never State funds to begin
 
05:42:25.708 --> 05:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
with so there's some anomalies with the
 
05:42:27.868 --> 05:42:27.878 align:start position:0%
bills that you would if you are going to
 
05:42:30.628 --> 05:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
pursue this as an Avenue for research
 
05:42:32.468 --> 05:42:32.478 align:start position:0%
there are necessary amendments that are
 
05:42:34.548 --> 05:42:34.558 align:start position:0%
going to have to take place to align
 
05:42:37.708 --> 05:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
this with the actual practicality of um
 
05:42:39.868 --> 05:42:39.878 align:start position:0%
How These funds should be administered
 
05:42:42.110 --> 05:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
so there is no guarantee with these arpa
 
05:42:43.750 --> 05:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
funds and in fact the arpa funds are
 
05:42:46.230 --> 05:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
identified and I know uh Miss Rogers has
 
05:42:47.830 --> 05:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
with her kind of a list of the things
 
05:42:49.628 --> 05:42:49.638 align:start position:0%
that we know typically the funds are
 
05:42:51.788 --> 05:42:51.798 align:start position:0%
used for for public health purposes for
 
05:42:53.708 --> 05:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
providing uh you know First Responders
 
05:42:55.788 --> 05:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
Frontline people who deal with this
 
05:42:58.468 --> 05:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
issue with um with money to be able to
 
05:43:02.310 --> 05:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
address ID 19 so there is questions
 
05:43:04.548 --> 05:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
whether or not this would in fact pass
 
05:43:06.350 --> 05:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
Federal mustard to begin with and
 
05:43:07.910 --> 05:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the legislation that
 
05:43:10.270 --> 05:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
absolves the department even with due
 
05:43:12.990 --> 05:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
diligence to seeking These funds to not
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
have to do what is required under this
 
05:43:17.830 --> 05:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh proposal in the event that the arpa
 
05:43:20.310 --> 05:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
funds are not made available to the
 
05:43:22.628 --> 05:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
department and so with that I think
 
05:43:24.350 --> 05:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the totality of at least
 
05:43:26.190 --> 05:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
the high level overview and some other
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
limitations within the grant I'll just
 
05:43:29.708 --> 05:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
mention one other you'll see that
 
05:43:32.788 --> 05:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
there's a specific a cap of
 
05:43:36.468 --> 05:43:36.478 align:start position:0%
$225,000 per uh vendor uh per presumably
 
05:43:38.750 --> 05:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
researcher to doing their funds so that
 
05:43:40.750 --> 05:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
chopped up between and it's not just $2
 
05:43:43.350 --> 05:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
million it's actually $4 million over
 
05:43:46.350 --> 05:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
the course of two State fisal years and
 
05:43:50.070 --> 05:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
so that $4 million carved up in uh by
 
05:43:51.350 --> 05:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
chunks of
 
05:43:53.110 --> 05:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
$250,000 shows you that we're going to
 
05:43:54.548 --> 05:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
have a number of vendors that are going
 
05:43:56.270 --> 05:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
to be out there and perhaps some with
 
05:43:59.070 --> 05:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
competing interest in terms of what they
 
05:44:01.150 --> 05:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
may represent in terms of the research
 
05:44:03.030 --> 05:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
it also is different because it asked
 
05:44:05.310 --> 05:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
this committee to actually and also the
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
Senate policy committee on health to act
 
05:44:10.190 --> 05:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
as an arbitrator on the research to
 
05:44:11.670 --> 05:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not you go to the
 
05:44:13.548 --> 05:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
next phase of the research in in the
 
05:44:16.230 --> 05:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
project again a very Noble different
 
05:44:18.310 --> 05:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
approach and I would just suggest by the
 
05:44:20.788 --> 05:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
wisdom of folks like rbson kushman who
 
05:44:23.510 --> 05:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
identify that there are some inherent
 
05:44:25.468 --> 05:44:25.478 align:start position:0%
misalignments with an executive branch
 
05:44:27.190 --> 05:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
agency managing this I wouldn't I
 
05:44:29.670 --> 05:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't use necessarily the word trust
 
05:44:31.310 --> 05:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
but it's just you you ask the right
 
05:44:33.150 --> 05:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
people to do the right things and we do
 
05:44:35.390 --> 05:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
great work but this type of work this is
 
05:44:37.270 --> 05:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
very novel not only for us but any other
 
05:44:39.110 --> 05:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
state agency and I think what was
 
05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
suggested by represent solay is really
 
05:44:43.548 --> 05:44:43.558 align:start position:0%
what should be looked at from this
 
05:44:45.150 --> 05:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
committee as an appropriate way to
 
05:44:46.788 --> 05:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
looking at this research issue so with
 
05:44:49.350 --> 05:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
that I would ask Miss Rogers if she has
 
05:44:50.708 --> 05:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
additional commentary because I know she
 
05:44:52.788 --> 05:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
knows the details because she actually
 
05:44:55.510 --> 05:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
did um the uh Yan's work around the
 
05:44:57.150 --> 05:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis on the bill working with
 
05:44:59.548 --> 05:44:59.558 align:start position:0%
her staff and and myself included
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
sure thank you John um I did want to
 
05:45:03.468 --> 05:45:03.478 align:start position:0%
just mention that we did complete the
 
05:45:05.190 --> 05:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on the bill as requested by
 
05:45:07.548 --> 05:45:07.558 align:start position:0%
the LBA um it tasks the department with
 
05:45:09.910 --> 05:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
a variety of things from um Drafting and
 
05:45:11.948 --> 05:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
proposing administrative rules um
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
establishing an application process
 
05:45:16.670 --> 05:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
toward grant funding um entering into
 
05:45:19.350 --> 05:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
contracts with recipients monitoring
 
05:45:21.070 --> 05:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
contract performance measures and vendor
 
05:45:23.548 --> 05:45:23.558 align:start position:0%
activities and paying invoices it also
 
05:45:26.030 --> 05:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
would require some additional staff that
 
05:45:27.468 --> 05:45:27.478 align:start position:0%
um is not appropriated for unless we
 
05:45:30.110 --> 05:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
were to receive arpa funds um and that
 
05:45:33.270 --> 05:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
is uncertain as John had alluded
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
to the bill is now in possession of the
 
05:45:40.110 --> 05:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
committee I think we have before us an
 
05:45:43.430 --> 05:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
extraordinary opportunity too often the
 
05:45:45.548 --> 05:45:45.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is
 
05:45:49.750 --> 05:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
last on things sometimes we're first
 
05:45:52.670 --> 05:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this be a good opportunity for
 
05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
us to be first in this I'm going to
 
05:46:01.230 --> 05:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
ask individuals in this committee to
 
05:46:03.190 --> 05:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
email me if you are interested in
 
05:46:06.110 --> 05:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
serving on a work group this is an early
 
05:46:08.708 --> 05:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
bill it's got to be out the door in the
 
05:46:11.390 --> 05:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
first half of February if you're
 
05:46:13.948 --> 05:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
interested in serving on a work group to
 
05:46:17.628 --> 05:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
make this an extraordinary
 
05:46:21.510 --> 05:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
bill please email me and I will appoint
 
05:46:23.310 --> 05:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
a work
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
group you will work with representative
 
05:46:29.788 --> 05:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
gon who is the Prime
 
05:46:32.830 --> 05:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor and attorney Williams who is
 
05:46:35.070 --> 05:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
bringing all kinds of things that this
 
05:46:36.468 --> 05:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
group will need to
 
05:46:39.430 --> 05:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
know any
 
05:46:42.230 --> 05:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
questions ranking
 
05:46:44.990 --> 05:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
member I actually have a question of the
 
05:46:47.430 --> 05:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
folks in the seat rather than the
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
procedure that you just outlined is that
 
05:46:52.430 --> 05:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay hold hold my thought go
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
ahead my question and I thank you for
 
05:46:58.948 --> 05:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
answering my other question which was is
 
05:47:01.110 --> 05:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature even involved in the
 
05:47:03.230 --> 05:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
allocation of arpa funds which I didn't
 
05:47:04.190 --> 05:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
think they
 
05:47:06.948 --> 05:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
were um
 
05:47:06.958 --> 05:47:08.548 align:start position:0%
were um
so

05:47:08.548 --> 05:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:47:12.788 --> 05:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to the well let me ask
 
05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
let me separate it into two questions
 
05:47:17.430 --> 05:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
could not the bill sponsor simply ask
 
05:47:19.708 --> 05:47:19.718 align:start position:0%
the the governor's office to talk to his
 
05:47:21.230 --> 05:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
commission about the allocation of the
 
05:47:22.990 --> 05:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
arpa funds and do it that way that's
 
05:47:23.000 --> 05:47:25.270 align:start position:0%
arpa funds and do it that way that's
number

05:47:25.270 --> 05:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:47:28.750 --> 05:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
one yes I believe so and my second
 
05:47:32.310 --> 05:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
second question is should we follow the
 
05:47:37.070 --> 05:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
procedure outlined here could you aside
 
05:47:39.628 --> 05:47:39.638 align:start position:0%
from the issue of the allocations in
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
various years and I assume it was going
 
05:47:45.510 --> 05:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
to finance so that would be worked out
 
05:47:49.310 --> 05:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
um could you remind us how long the ru
 
05:47:52.310 --> 05:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
making process T typically takes if this
 
05:47:55.468 --> 05:47:55.478 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't uh take effect till June
 
05:47:58.270 --> 05:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
30th could you give us a timeline on the
 
05:48:01.628 --> 05:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
ru process following that I could
 
05:48:03.910 --> 05:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
briefly um although I do not I'm not
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
involved directly with administrative
 
05:48:06.510 --> 05:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
rules I've been doing this work and
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
enough working with people who do it to
 
05:48:10.430 --> 05:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
have an idea of what the timelines are
 
05:48:12.590 --> 05:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
so even with the most ambitious of
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
schedules it typically would take around
 
05:48:17.230 --> 05:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
six months from initiating the rule
 
05:48:20.548 --> 05:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
process to prating final rules uh you
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
know so that is even in with it being an
 
05:48:25.468 --> 05:48:25.478 align:start position:0%
ambitious process so there are some
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
timing issues relative to standing this
 
05:48:30.390 --> 05:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
program up because it is contemplated if
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
there is a need for administrative rules
 
05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
and I have to say that's a big question
 
05:48:36.708 --> 05:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
mark because ABS in the legislation is
 
05:48:38.150 --> 05:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
what we would actually have to do to
 
05:48:39.948 --> 05:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules and I'd have to get
 
05:48:41.868 --> 05:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
with the policy folks to find out what
 
05:48:43.510 --> 05:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
type of rules would be needed sometimes
 
05:48:45.390 --> 05:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
in legislation it's self-executing
 
05:48:47.070 --> 05:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
because legislation either gives us the
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
authority to do things without rules or
 
05:48:51.070 --> 05:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
clearly identifies what's our rules and
 
05:48:54.110 --> 05:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility but in the absence of
 
05:48:56.468 --> 05:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
that kind of Direction a fair statement
 
05:48:58.070 --> 05:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
would be at least 6 months from
 
05:49:02.030 --> 05:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
initiating Ro process to finalizing the
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
roles anyone else with questions for the
 
05:49:11.390 --> 05:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:13.670 --> 05:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
Solway representative Solway into the
 
05:49:15.390 --> 05:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
mic closer please for the old people
 
05:49:18.468 --> 05:49:18.478 align:start position:0%
here would you believe thank you would
 
05:49:22.510 --> 05:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
you believe that the National Institute
 
05:49:26.430 --> 05:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
of heart lung and blood diseases a
 
05:49:28.708 --> 05:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
member organization of the national
 
05:49:32.788 --> 05:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
Institutes of Health has as we speak a
 
05:49:37.628 --> 05:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
request for proposals an RFP in exactly
 
05:49:41.910 --> 05:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
this area with proposals due February
 
05:49:45.868 --> 05:49:45.878 align:start position:0%
5th ample money to fund those projects
 
05:49:48.948 --> 05:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
decisions after submission February 5th
 
05:49:51.310 --> 05:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
would probably come within nine months
 
05:49:53.548 --> 05:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
with a start date to be about a year
 
05:49:56.948 --> 05:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
from now would you believe that with all
 
05:49:58.788 --> 05:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
du respect of committee I actually feel
 
05:50:00.468 --> 05:50:00.478 align:start position:0%
like I'm watching my cousin Vinnie right
 
05:50:01.910 --> 05:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
now and I'd like to say I'd absolutely
 
05:50:04.390 --> 05:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
believe in that so what's wrong with my
 
05:50:06.990 --> 05:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
cousin Vinnie I love the movie oh so do
 
05:50:09.830 --> 05:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
I anyone
 
05:50:13.788 --> 05:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
else representative kerk um just because
 
05:50:15.510 --> 05:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
I you you mentioned a lot about the fact
 
05:50:17.150 --> 05:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
that the department usually works on
 
05:50:19.230 --> 05:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
Contracting for services and so on with
 
05:50:22.990 --> 05:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
rfps do you feel that DHHS actually has
 
05:50:25.788 --> 05:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
the expertise to make appropriate
 
05:50:30.468 --> 05:50:30.478 align:start position:0%
decisions about um funding re basic
 
05:50:33.708 --> 05:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
research and uh I mean do we have people
 
05:50:35.468 --> 05:50:35.478 align:start position:0%
in the department capable of doing that
 
05:50:37.110 --> 05:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
or would that need to be contracted out
 
05:50:37.120 --> 05:50:39.788 align:start position:0%
or would that need to be contracted out
as

05:50:39.788 --> 05:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:41.868 --> 05:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
well um I would think that we would have
 
05:50:43.990 --> 05:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
to partner with an academic academic
 
05:50:46.590 --> 05:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
institution um or or turn that over to
 
05:50:51.430 --> 05:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
them uh to to go through that process um
 
05:50:54.270 --> 05:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
follow up followup and is that accounted
 
05:50:56.788 --> 05:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
for in the fiscal Noe as well because I
 
05:50:57.990 --> 05:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
assume they aren't going to do it for
 
05:50:58.000 --> 05:50:58.990 align:start position:0%
assume they aren't going to do it for
free

05:50:58.990 --> 05:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
free
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh no I would think that would be
 
05:51:01.670 --> 05:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
additional but I can go back and look
 
05:51:04.150 --> 05:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
through that the fiscal note thank you
 
05:51:04.160 --> 05:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
through that the fiscal note thank you
thank

05:51:07.120 --> 05:51:07.130 align:start position:0%
