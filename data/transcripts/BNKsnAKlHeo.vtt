00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
by the hot tub place in Keene he's got a
 
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
stack of them sitting out front there
 
00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 align:start position:0%
which seems like outrageous to me so so
 
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I I certainly uh support the con
 
00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
you know think that we need to do more
 
00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 align:start position:0%
you know they need you know they need to
 
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
get service but
 
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
all right so anybody have a problem with
 
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill
 
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.410 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill
okay

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
so we'll
 
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 align:start position:0%
oh John you would like to see
 
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
you can wait wait till you take it up as
 
00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
a full committee okay so the
 
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation at this point is to uh
 
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
okay so does everybody understands what
 
00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
retaining means we will have to vote on
 
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
the committee the world's committee will
 
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
have to vote to retain it uh in the old
 
00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
days it used to be the chair could have
 
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
a sense of retaining and just I could do
 
00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
the chair could unilaterally do that
 
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
then people decided that that wasn't
 
00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
right that wasn't fair and so then they
 
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
changed the rule that we now that we do
 
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
actually have a vote we'll have a vote
 
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
to retain it
 
00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
um and uh but that it actually we the
 
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
retaining motion does not go to the
 
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
floor it's just an automatic motion that
 
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
the committee retains it it just
 
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
automatically is retained and
 
00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
um and then we would take up retain
 
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
bills next fall and uh retain bills then
 
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
have to be out of committee uh by end of
 
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
October and uh and the one one week not
 
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
that anyone's going to want to miss a
 
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
session day anyways but the one week you
 
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
don't want to miss it's the first week
 
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
in January because that's when all the
 
00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 align:start position:0%
retain bills hit the floor and uh so and
 
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
now can be rather exciting
 
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.609 align:start position:0%
now can be rather exciting
representative

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
just a question on procedure if the if
 
00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor comes to us with an
 
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
amendment before we vote to retain we
 
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
would consider that amendment is that
 
00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
correct if a prime sponsor came forward
 
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
with an amendment before we vote to
 
00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
retain it I mean even in remote to
 
00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
retain it um I mean it's it's what's
 
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
this bill number this is 73.
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to we don't have to
 
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
take action on this until March by the
 
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.430 align:start position:0%
take action on this until March by the
mid-march

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
mid-march
 
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
to retain it so yes if an amendment
 
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
would if someone came forward with an
 
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.250 align:start position:0%
would if someone came forward with an
amendment

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I would certainly call another
 
00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and then we would discuss
 
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
that amount but I wouldn't wait until
 
00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
exact session so so yeah this is this uh
 
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
this is a late departure so with um the
 
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
person whoever the persons have have a
 
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
month to come up with something
 
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.390 align:start position:0%
month to come up with something
yeah

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
it would still be the subcommittee
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.509 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
next up uh
 
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh 173 related to toilet facilities
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
provided by restaurants
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
so wasn't there
 
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
the uh someone from the home uh uh the
 
00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
building code is Code Enforcement right
 
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
the code is that he he or she here today
 
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
no but they're recommended we just
 
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
repeal the whole statue is that is that
 
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.830 align:start position:0%
right yeah
foreign

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.630 align:start position:0%
foreign
okay

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
not in expedient this was to repeal
 
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
but the codes aren't ready yet
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
what code was supposed to be ready the
 
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
state building codes the state building
 
00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
code is still
 
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's still in development but eventually
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
we should repeal this eventually okay so
 
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
we just retain it would because we don't
 
00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
know when that'll happen right so I
 
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
you already okay with that retaining
 
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
what are we doing gonna retain it and
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
for what purpose uh we're waiting until
 
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
the new building uh State Building Code
 
00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
gets implemented and in that time we
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
all right we remain along all right
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
um 178 relative to enforcement of condo
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
liens for assessments
 
00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
um I I got a phone message from the
 
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
sponsor last night and he requests that
 
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
we retain this bill
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
um I had a long phone conversation with
 
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
him on Monday and we I basically said
 
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
you you need to if the issue is that the
 
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
the banks are not foreclosing then you
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
need to you need to work with them to
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to get them to
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
foreclose but I said I my sense was from
 
00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 align:start position:0%
this committee that we were not too
 
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
excited about the idea of the neighbors
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
for closing on you simply because you
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
haven't paid your your fees but I don't
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
know how anybody else
 
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
what's the point out one other issue
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
with the bill that wasn't discussed much
 
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh previously it also allows just
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
provides an adequate protection for
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
tenants that a number of condos are
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
leased out by owners who are not
 
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.129 align:start position:0%
leased out by owners who are not
actually

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
using the unit themselves this would
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
allow for tenants who are renting the
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
unit in good faith to potentially be
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
evicted despite paying their rent in
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
full who have nothing to do with the
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
condo fees and would then be displaced
 
00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 align:start position:0%
because a an owner who doesn't like the
 
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 align:start position:0%
amount they're paying for a pool fee and
 
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
is withholding the the condo association
 
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
fee those tenants would then be
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
displaced through no fault of their own
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
we need to find a protection for good
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
faith tenants in the bill as well
 
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
John good luck with that well it may be
 
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
this is just sometimes there's a bill is
 
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
just a bad Bill
 
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
that too
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair what was it supposed to be an
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
amendment that took that made this only
 
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
applicable to houses that have been
 
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
abandoned right that's true that was a
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
that was the uh Amendment they were
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
trying to work on but good luck on
 
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
defining that what's abandoned yeah
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
right you know Bandy says okay there's
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
no no no things in it but you know Steve
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
Jobs had was pretty sparse in his living
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
arrangements you know so you know you
 
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
might not have much in there and people
 
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
can say oh that looks abandoned to me
 
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
well you know just because the person
 
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
he's got a job overseas and and not
 
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
around but he's paying his mortgage or
 
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
he or she is paying their mortgage
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
they're paying their taxes the only
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
thing they're not paying is the
 
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
association fees and you know maybe they
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
think they don't have to pay it or
 
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to pay it because they're
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know it's not right either I that is
 
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
you know it's not right either I that is
true

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
but audience members yes okay
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
come on up Garrett yeah you don't come
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
up just speak from there and speak
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
loudly okay okay well actually you might
 
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
just speak my I'm sorry representative
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
Gibbs would like you to speak to the mic
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.490 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
yep

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to provide a quick uh
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
update we actually had a brief
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
warning with the back this bill uh both
 
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
sides are willing to work on it both
 
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
sides are willing to meet to discuss it
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
and uh we do believe that if you retain
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
the bill and afford US the time that we
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
will be able to turn this into something
 
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
passable uh we believe that that there
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
certainly is a problem we are going to
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
attempt to resolve it in a way that
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
works for both sides and that's what we
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
hope to be able to present great
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
then of course and the bankers agree I
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
chairman you want to say you want to
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
speak to her okay okay
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative Herbert go ahead I
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
just uh an observation of if my memory
 
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:33.419 align:start position:0%
serves me correctly there was an issue
 
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
of how long uh uh you can go with the
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
lien uh it's not an immediate thing I
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
mean you there was a time frame was it
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
six months well the six months is in the
 
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
current law now
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
that was just that was where we already
 
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
passed over the six months but this was
 
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
this was that they you know if they had
 
00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
if it how if it wasn't occupied for a
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
year or something it was some was there
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
a timeline on how long it wasn't
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
occupied yeah we're working to Define
 
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
that okay but it was that so that
 
00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:07.019 align:start position:0%
amendment was never drawn up it yeah no
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
not yet
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
no so anyway so that wasn't actually
 
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
determined but that yes there was uh
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
some discussion about it and I and I I
 
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
was unclear as to what
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
what that was going to be because I
 
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
thought the time frame was was uh
 
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
thought the time frame was was uh
important

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
stay tuned on that okay yeah go ahead
 
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.769 align:start position:0%
stay tuned on that okay yeah go ahead
sorry

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you committee members uh yeah
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
we did have a brief conversation and we
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
would be open to at least looking at
 
00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
what is proposed
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
um as long as it doesn't impact
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
um Banks property rights
 
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and obviously the foreclosing of
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
um of the unit by the Association is
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
always something that is very concerning
 
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
to us so but we are open to at least
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
looking at um some language to see if it
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
could address uh their concerns as well
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
as protect our property rights
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
so thank you great all right so yes okay
 
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs and then obviously
 
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.339 align:start position:0%
cool thank you uh I just like to
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate that I think it's extremely
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
important that any Amendment
 
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
um provide protection uh for the condo
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
owner uh so that the condo owner would
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
not be foreclosed
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
um and evicted from a 200 000 unit for a
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollar
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
um unpaid condo fee because that's what
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
as As I understood it at least the bill
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
as presented was just
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
um uh six months
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and it didn't didn't change the the
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
six months unpaid condo fees uh and I
 
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:51.500 align:start position:0%
calculated that out just for my own unit
 
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh and it was a little over two thousand
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
dollars and I just wanted to reiterate
 
00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
the importance of providing some
 
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
protection uh against that unfairness so
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's three things represent a call
 
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like Ryan to come
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
back up and talk about the risks the
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
bank has to take
 
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
no we don't we don't have to do it you
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that no no but we we
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
because we're not taking tests when
 
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
we're not this is this is just a
 
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.850 align:start position:0%
we're not this is this is just a
subgrade

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:27.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
you can give your opinion that is true
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
you can give your opinion you can say
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
you think this is too risky for well I
 
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
would say this is absolutely too risky
 
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
for the bank yeah because you had
 
00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
lawyers come up here and saying that we
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
can spend twenty thousand dollars in
 
00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
Lori bills trying to chase these fees
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
and then the you sell the property on
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
the bank and the bank's the one that's
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
on the hook for the 30 grand
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
not the association you need to keep
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
that in mind folks
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
there you go okay
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019 align:start position:0%
okay so my instinct was right on that
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
one okay uh all right moving on relative
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
condo disclosure of financial
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
information so this is now
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative about me so
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
representative you do realize the cut
 
00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:22.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
you have to turn you have to press the
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
you know yeah you know how to do this
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
so you you disagree you think
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
accountants will be would be willing to
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
do this well there I have spent quite a
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
lot of time in recent days talking with
 
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
the CCPA society and talking with on
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
several accountants that I know in my
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
town including the one that is doing
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
this for us and for a lot of small
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
non-profits in Lebanon area uh
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
and on but I do have a clearer I think
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
version of it as an amendment of what
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
that person does in Lebanon and what
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
other people when you
 
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:20.540 align:start position:0%
uh go down a Commercial Street in a town
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a at least one
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
store that advertises that it does tax
 
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.610 align:start position:0%
store that advertises that it does tax
returns

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
returns
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
on in our case some of them keep the
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
signs up all year round
 
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.710 align:start position:0%
signs up all year round
and

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
they are a number of those are CPAs
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
they made a decision that they wanted to
 
00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:49.459 align:start position:0%
spend their time as CPAs
 
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
taking care of small businesses and
 
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.670 align:start position:0%
taking care of small businesses and
small

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:13:59.810 --> 00:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
on non-profits that did not have enough
 
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220 align:start position:0%
money to pay seven thousand dollars a
 
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:03.740 align:start position:0%
year for an audit
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
I talked to one of the CPA Society
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
people yesterday that said oh well we're
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
cheaper than all the others we can do it
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
for 2500.
 
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.370 align:start position:0%
for 2500.
ah

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's still a lot of money for
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
for a place like mine which is 22 unit
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
homeowner units on that has been trying
 
00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339 align:start position:0%
to keep the costs down for a long time
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
and is also trying to keep the
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance up
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot more for a library
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
Society or somebody like that in smaller
 
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.250 align:start position:0%
Society or somebody like that in smaller
towns

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
so these people I I have known two
 
00:14:58.129 --> 00:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
others one of whom died on me
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
on a number of years ago when he was
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
work when he was doing my taxes as well
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
so he was capable of doing more but he
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
never did large audits of the kind that
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
the people who run the CPI society and
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
most of the accountants that you will
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
meet all of the accountants that you
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
will meet here actually on
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
on do
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
is the large audits
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
this is not what I'm asking for is not
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
an audit it's kind of a minimal
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
reassurance and wake-up call to the
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
membership from the board
 
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
on done by an independent and that's
 
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
what's in the amendment
 
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
if I could pass it out on I've been
 
00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:48.710 align:start position:0%
if I could pass it out on I've been
trying

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
trying
 
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.310 align:start position:0%
trying
um

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
I haven't gotten an account to actually
 
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
approve of this language because they
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
all say oh but you need to ensure that
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
there is no fraud
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
and that requires your seven thousand
 
00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:04.370 align:start position:0%
and that requires your seven thousand
dollars

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
or maybe to some extent you're twenty
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
five hundred if you can uh there's one
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
firm that does that apparently and they
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
sound like a good firm but on doing that
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
every single year when you don't have
 
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
any indication that there is fraud going
 
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.090 align:start position:0%
any indication that there is fraud going
on

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
just it's just too pricey for a lot of
 
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.210 align:start position:0%
just it's just too pricey for a lot of
small

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.220 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
places and and also I was thinking that
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
you would not approve of
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
uh requiring of a condominium board that
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
they spend seven thousand dollars I'm
 
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
pretty sure we would not approve that is
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
true and that a lot of them would find
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
ways to avoid obeying at law and they'd
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
end up in court anyway
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
so um this this is
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
this is just one piece of
 
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
of what was done in
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
in on 239 but it is the part that the
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
accountants had
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
had a problem so what you have there is
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
to pass out is the same thing I have
 
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.429 align:start position:0%
to pass out is the same thing I have
here

00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
sort of looks like it yeah
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
yeah it says a just a pure recur and I
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
mean I guess that's spelled right a
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
letter for an independent accountant
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
which compares the bank statements with
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
the association's annual budget and
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
records of expenses revenues and changes
 
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
in capital Reservoir reserves I put that
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
on just on on paper because I know you
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
have to do the amendment if you're going
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
to we would do the amendment right so
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
but so actually it's interesting you
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
said you brought up non-profits yeah do
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
condo associations have to file a 990 or
 
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:52.820 align:start position:0%
a tax return
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
on condo associations have two methods
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
that they can use
 
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
and homeowner associations right on the
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
one that we use being small and on not
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
having a paid management I'm the
 
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.370 align:start position:0%
having a paid management I'm the
management

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:12.380 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
right and we
 
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
um is h11
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
90 or 1160 I forget which at this point
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
I haven't had to do those for a while
 
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
because the treasurer took them over
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
but but on the alternative is I believe
 
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:33.539 align:start position:0%
the one that you're talking about but
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
the people behind me can probably tell
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
you better and if you have ex major
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
expenses from having a property manager
 
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
and uh and a lot of subcontractors of
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
the property manager it's worth your
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
while to go
 
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.169 align:start position:0%
while to go
um

00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
and you're actually making a profit on
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
something uh it's worth your while to go
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
beyond the
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
h1160 I think it is which was developed
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
in the early 1960s and still charges you
 
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:10.340 align:start position:0%
30 percent of any profit you make over
 
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
the dues and operating on they
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
on the prophet is can if is beyond the
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
dues we went
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
on we did a conservation cut after 70
 
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:30.380 align:start position:0%
years of forest growth after a cut
 
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
and uh years ago now and
 
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
we got back we were not expecting to
 
00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:39.419 align:start position:0%
make any money off of it but we got back
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars and we had to give
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
10 percent to the town and we had to
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.419 --> 00:19:50.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
um so but as far as you know you don't
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
have to file a 990 or tax return type
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
thing dude I guess I'll look at the
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
association does homeowners associations
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
or condo associations do you have to
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
file any and what what tax return do
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
yeah what
 
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.289 align:start position:0%
yeah what
yeah

00:20:11.289 --> 00:20:11.299 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
I could tell you later but I don't have
 
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
it in my head the reason I say that is I
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
I'm a trustee of two two non-profits in
 
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
my town and I used to do the 990 even
 
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
the night when the 990ez was really easy
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
and then it's not easy anymore so now I
 
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
now I have uh other other uh accountants
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
to do it and you can't you can't hire an
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
account I mean I got one entity that all
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
it does is accumulate money I write two
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
checks a year I mean you know and and uh
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
they they still charge 600 for that
 
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
review of all what I did all the chat
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
and all the bank statements and
 
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
everything and do all that so I mean to
 
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
to mandate a condo association to having
 
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
to do something like this seems a little
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
Draconian if the condo association's
 
00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:03.539 align:start position:0%
really small and and you know paperwork
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
but I was thinking that the other way
 
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
around it is that if they if there is a
 
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
tax return filed
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
than I believe under all tax return laws
 
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
that you're required to hand and send a
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
copy out to all the Association members
 
00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:21.059 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm required to all the board
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
members get a copy of the tax return
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
which would seem to be the same what
 
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do with this language
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
well the 1160
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
on only asks
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
how much uh profit did you make over
 
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
over the
 
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
the dues
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
and right that's the only problem all it
 
00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:47.630 align:start position:0%
and right that's the only problem all it
asks

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
asks
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
right that's not really relative to here
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
because I would say most are not making
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
money yeah if you're if you're doing one
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
of the more complicated tax returns you
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
you really ought to be able to release
 
00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:00.299 align:start position:0%
that tax return uh I've worked with a
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
number of condo associations where
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
um the owners did not see had never seen
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
it I mean it never occurred to any of
 
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:12.380 align:start position:0%
them that they'd see a tax return
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
on and I've worked with a number of them
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
where people got away with things like
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
did I tell you about this one before
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
a a local Bank in Lincoln
 
00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:28.190 align:start position:0%
a a local Bank in Lincoln
on

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
on loaned money to a condo board on the
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
authority of the president
 
00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:36.710 align:start position:0%
authority of the president
alone

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.210 align:start position:0%
alone
on

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
for operating expenses and made on and
 
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
made itself the manager of all the money
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
of the condo association and no one else
 
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
on the condensation knew it happened
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
they actually did it twice the first
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
time there there was a Treasurer the
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
okay so this is not an early bill so we
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
don't have to take action on this right
 
00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:05.690 align:start position:0%
don't have to take action on this right
away

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
um so if you have you know we could get
 
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
some resolution to that
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
um then the committee can then move
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
forward well I I think I've gotten about
 
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
as far as I can get unless I I could go
 
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
to other towns to the main streets and
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
talk to someone well like I say you're
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
you're the problem the concept is you
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
know great but it's to mandate every
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
condo to have to hand over their
 
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
checks and have to to a bookkeeper
 
00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's gonna you know I was
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
saying at least a hundred dollars a
 
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
month and you just said 200 no no I said
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
300 once a year
 
00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:45.299 align:start position:0%
I thought it was 250. 2 500 I thought
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
you said oh no that was
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
um a the cheapest of the firms that does
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
real audits oh I got you okay said that
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
they told me that they worked hard to
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
make them affordable and that but to do
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
something like this is going to take I
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
mean 2 500 was the least they could do
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
yeah but to me to do this you're you're
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
requiring some bookkeeper to every month
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then the question is that you're
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
only saying only an independent
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
Association in other words you're
 
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
looking for a CPA and I don't know any
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
CPA he's less than a couple hundred
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour and what I'm telling you
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
is that uh there are a bunch of them on
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
this main streets of our state
 
00:24:41.169 --> 00:24:41.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
Main Street to another to get you
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
examples from other people okay state
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
but right fair enough all right so we
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
will take that up at some other time
 
00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:51.059 align:start position:0%
because we don't have to take care of
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
that chairman yes
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
um representative thank you
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little confused
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
um is there going to be an amendment
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
um changing uh HB 239 from a requirement
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
for information disclosure to a
 
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
requirement to some kind of limited
 
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.810 align:start position:0%
requirement to some kind of limited
audit

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
your microphone's off
 
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.250 align:start position:0%
on the
uh

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
I've been struggling to find a way that
 
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.430 align:start position:0%
I've been struggling to find a way that
on

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
2B is actually in two parts uh two
 
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
stages the the first one the minimalist
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
approach that would provide some kind of
 
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
financial information to the members of
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
the association which a lot of them do
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
not get in any form at this point
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
except a budget that says that this is
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
how much we're spending this is how much
 
00:25:53.049 --> 00:25:53.059 align:start position:0%
we're we're
 
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
on asking you for for dues we're
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
requiring dues of you because the law is
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
actually that
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
um the the members of an association
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
have to defeat the budget in order to
 
00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:16.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
so I do have an amendment I would I
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
could certainly pass that out she'll
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
pass out thank you
 
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.850 align:start position:0%
pass out thank you
okay

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh I think at this point we we we're not
 
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
ready to take action yet we can wait to
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
see how this trickles out
 
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
um because this is not this is a late
 
00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.769 align:start position:0%
um because this is not this is a late
departure

00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
departure
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to the next one house
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
bill 459 relative transaction exempt
 
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
from the regulation of business
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
practices from consumer protection
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
no I don't have pfas I have 459 first
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay this is one where half the room is
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
here for
 
00:26:52.919 --> 00:26:54.710 align:start position:0%
here for
you okay

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody who thinks this bill is a
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a good idea but I can
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
speak to it okay no I just want to give
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
a person who wants it speak and see for
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Ammon would like
 
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
I mean this bill to me seems very well
 
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.450 align:start position:0%
I mean this bill to me seems very well
intentioned

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
intentioned
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
every bill has a grain of Truth every
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
bill has the granted truth
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
um but we're talking about exemptions
 
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539 align:start position:0%
for very highly regulated uh sections of
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
our economy
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
and uh I think
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
giving a private right of action in some
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
of these instances would have quite a
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
few unintended consequences and uh
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
I think you know deferring to the wisdom
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
that's been built up in statute over
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
decades maybe longer is the way to uh to
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
keep the to keep it
 
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments from the
 
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.250 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments from the
committee

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
yeah Remington feel up
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
I I guess all path leads are Rome I
 
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
think that private right of action in
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
some of these areas may be wise but
 
00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:18.059 align:start position:0%
doing the eliminating the exemptions in
 
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act as this bill
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
seeks to do
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
is advisable as well that if we seek to
 
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
create private rates of action we should
 
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
do it in each of the individual areas
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
organic acts rather than eliminating the
 
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
exemption within the consumer protection
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
act itself
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting way of doing it I
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
agree but
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
okay so uh representative Ammon second
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
by reference and Fila moves in expedient
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion okay the
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
voting on this is just the eight people
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
you all know who you are right okay all
 
00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
those in favor raise your hand one two
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
three four five
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr chairman
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
yes just to be sure this list
 
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
um looks like it's the older list you
 
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
used oh right right that's fine yeah
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
thank you did you have the older list or
 
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
the new list this is like an older one
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
yeah I know you switched us it didn't
 
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
get up there oh it's the wrong one
 
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.529 align:start position:0%
get up there oh it's the wrong one
it's

00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:36.539 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay sorry okay all right so yeah so the
 
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:42.419 align:start position:0%
correction was that uh representative
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
Sullivan is now on the
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
um the the liquor and representative
 
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.380 align:start position:0%

yeah thank you but you stay right there
 
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:04.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:06.860 align:start position:0%
the two others
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
no I want you here yes because in case
 
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.210 align:start position:0%
no I want you here yes because in case
there's

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
partisan type stuff we want to make sure
 
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
easy enough okay uh House Bill 465
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
restricting the use of pfas substances
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
in certain consumer products
 
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:39.289 align:start position:0%
in certain consumer products
uh

00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
let me just trying to figure out what I
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
want to do on the previous Bill and I'm
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
not happy okay
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
all right uh this bill is in early
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:49.679 --> 00:30:54.889 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh which one of this bit what did this
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
bill do
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
I know
 
00:31:00.539 --> 00:31:03.169 align:start position:0%
I know
business

00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
my problem my number one problem is
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
enforcement of this
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.299 --> 00:32:11.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
just does anybody feel really strongly
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
should we pass this or can we should we
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
just retain it
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
I think what's your password I think
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
the um sponsor asked me to to say
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
something to oh good great go ahead
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
um wait a second I lost it I lost it
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
um representative Ebel couldn't be here
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
today and she wanted to bring to the
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee's attention the fact that
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
babies and children are playing on these
 
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.230 align:start position:0%
babies and children are playing on these
carpets

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
carpets
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
um and they can the dust can be inhaled
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
and adjusted as well as it gets on their
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
children's hands and toys which I think
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
is a significant issue that we need to
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
address she also wanted to make some
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
clarifying language so I think for for
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know I I think we at minimum should
 
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
retain it I'd like to pass it right but
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
she's saying we need to clarify the
 
00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:12.059 align:start position:0%
language and
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
um she wants to clarify the language to
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
replace the term aftermarket stain and
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
what water resistant treatment and
 
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
um with the term fabric treatment
 
00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.649 align:start position:0%
um with the term fabric treatment
um

00:33:23.649 --> 00:33:23.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
and to make a change to fabric
 
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
to meaning a textile made by weaving
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
knitting or felting natural fibers or
 
00:33:33.649 --> 00:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
synthetic fibers
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
but who's going to enforce this statue
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
but is there any evidence that this
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
stuff these carpets are being still
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
being sold today
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
I mean I haven't seen Scotchgard ever
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
advertised recently but that was called
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
right and so so that people really are
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
buying this stuff
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead remember that section the
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
the issue is it's in almost every and so
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
my concern with this bill is not only is
 
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
it being sold but it's on
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
probably this carpet and virtually every
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
carpet you buy if you go to Home Depot
 
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
or your favorite carpet wholesaler
 
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
you're going to be buying carpet with
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
this with pfas on it so there's no
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
there's no replacement product so you
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
have a bill from New Hampshire that's
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
fine and as she said in the testimony
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
she checked with and there's no
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of carpets in New Hampshire
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
that's true there's only two or three in
 
00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
the United States so you've got a whole
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
big industry and maybe it's the right
 
00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:46.669 align:start position:0%
big industry and maybe it's the right
idea

00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
but you're gonna what you're gonna do is
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
it means nobody in New Hampshire is
 
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to be able to buy new carpet
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
if this passes the way it's written and
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
you'll have big retailers the
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement comes Home Depot doesn't
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
want to be sued so they're just not
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
going to sell the stuff right
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to note that the
 
00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.609 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to note that the
effect

00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
five I would be doubtful about this
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
sooner because it's pretty clear that
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
the carpet manufacturers and sellers are
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to need time to gear up to comply
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
with this uh but an effective date more
 
00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.230 align:start position:0%
with this uh but an effective date more
than

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
two years down the road I think will
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
give them time and if that's not a
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of time we should
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
consider uh an amendment that would move
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
the effective date farther out but uh
 
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
that said
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
the problem is apparently severe enough
 
00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:44.339 align:start position:0%
um that I would say provided we give the
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and sellers time I would
 
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
recommend ought to pass
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
so um this committee over the years has
 
00:35:57.609 --> 00:35:57.619 align:start position:0%
used the well retain an interim study
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
methodology before to uh to let to put
 
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:03.829 align:start position:0%
methodology before to uh to let to put
um

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
manufacturer put people on notice
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
um we I think um again now I'm going to
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
really uh date myself representative
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
Crow Dickinson um who is from Conway
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
area and he kept wanting to uh stop
 
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
having Maine come over and and try to
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
collect taxes from New Hampshire
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
businesses that were selling appliances
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
into Maine and evidently Maine would do
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
that and so he put in a bill and what we
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
did with the bills we just we always
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
kept the bill alive right we always
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
interim study it retained it interim
 
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
study we never killed the bill and he
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
said that that was useful in which uh
 
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
and Maine evidently stopped coming into
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire because we
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
did that so and I would say in this case
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
and that that this is a good argument to
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
retain the bill to let everybody on
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
those that we're we have a bill and
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
we're ready to do something if when it
 
00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
becomes clear that the uh the the
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
marketplace is not addressing the
 
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.490 align:start position:0%
marketplace is not addressing the
problem

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
I think I think the retaining is a good
 
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
idea though I in doing so I I'd actually
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
would hope that we would work to solve
 
00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
the problem as right rather than just
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
saying well it's sort of in this problem
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
we're not scientists we're not you know
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
chemical scientists are going to figure
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
out how to make carpet
 
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
that that is stain resistant is that is
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
that the issue here is that all carbons
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
I mean I know this carpet you know was
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
within a year ago we just bought this
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
new carpet that I saw you know somebody
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
spilled their coffee on it and it's
 
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
still that stain is still there
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
Washington whenever they whenever they
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
asked about climate change they all said
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're not scientists so
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
you know meaning we can't do anything
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
about it we can't right no well I'd like
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
right representative Hammond
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just wanted to
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
call back to representative Spears
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
comment a few bills ago about the
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
marketplace having an incredible power
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
to change the behavior of Manufacturers
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is important because
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
it helps to highlight the idea makes
 
00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:12.500 align:start position:0%
people aware of it
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
and uh but it's really up to the
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
consumer the consumers to put pressure
 
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
on manufacturers to change their their
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
processes I think you can see
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
a myriad of examples of that working and
 
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
being effective
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
but maybe people wouldn't know about the
 
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
problem if this bill was never submitted
 
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.690 align:start position:0%
problem if this bill was never submitted
so

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.550 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
to me the Bill's a mandate and I think
 
00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:38.579 align:start position:0%
we should tread lightly when it comes to
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
mandates but consumer education is
 
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.609 align:start position:0%
mandates but consumer education is
important

00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
and Anybody Everybody okay with that
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
representative speaker you would like to
 
00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.710 align:start position:0%
representative speaker you would like to
comment

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate you quoting me by the
 
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.609 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate you quoting me by the
way

00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
but this is a health issue this isn't
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
well if you don't have repair this week
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
all right so someday you will
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
this is a health issue and we heard
 
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
testimony that was devastating as to the
 
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
this bill needs a little more respect I
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
think than retaining it maybe
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
something because I have talked to uh
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
people in my neighborhood some of them
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
didn't even know what pfas was and
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're drinking it every day and they
 
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
don't even know
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
I looked at the website for
 
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.810 align:start position:0%
I looked at the website for
um

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh our water supply
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
and the groundwater is a mess and they
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
tell you don't drink the groundwater but
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the water coming out of uh
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
pentachuck it's not perfect either it's
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
not bad yet but it has been going up
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
if we somehow educated people something
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative McAleer
 
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
um I I agree I think putting an ought to
 
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
pass on this gives a little more teeth
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
than retain I mean everybody's talking
 
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
about this problem but nobody's doing
 
00:40:17.089 --> 00:40:17.099 align:start position:0%
anything about it and I think we have a
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
chance to at least put one step forward
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
here by uh ought to pass on this Bill
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
are you okay with retaining it no
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer to ought to pass I think that
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
puts more teeth into it
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.670 align:start position:0%
I agree
Herbert

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
Herbert
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
I agree with the uh the the severity and
 
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.530 align:start position:0%
I agree with the uh the the severity and
emergency

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:50.540 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh people have to know that there is an
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
emergency going on around them and uh
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's why I would go out to pass put it
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
into law
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden everybody's got
 
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
to talk about it and when that happens
 
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
we might get something done but right
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
now they're just dumping it in the
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
landfills in in New Hampshire and it's a
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
and in Merrimack you can't even don't go
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
fishing and eat the fish that's that's
 
00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:20.339 align:start position:0%
that's a problem and it's an emergency
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
in my in my opinion so
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'd run the red red flag up on this
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation how are
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
you going to enforce it
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
I don't care whether it's going to be
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
enforced I want to know that everybody
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
else knows it needs to be enforced just
 
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
like okay this this gentleman talks
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
about the consumer pushback blowback
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
because all of a sudden people are just
 
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.690 align:start position:0%
because all of a sudden people are just
going

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
and guess what then you have then you
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
have something happen Okay
 
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative post is this more Federal
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
issue because most of the carpeting
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
right and we as We Know
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
nobody really making carpets in New
 
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.050 align:start position:0%
nobody really making carpets in New
Hampshire

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
well we're theoretically we'll stop New
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens from buying carpet if
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
from out of state I mean theoretically I
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
guess we're making Home Depot
 
00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.390 align:start position:0%
guess we're making Home Depot
responsible

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
you would just go across state line to
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
go buy your carpet right representative
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
feel it I guess a couple points in terms
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
of enforcement we've left it to the
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
department to enforce us
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
administratively which
 
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
we're leave really leaving a lot to
 
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.750 align:start position:0%
we're leave really leaving a lot to
interpretation

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
um but because of it it's an
 
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
administrative interpretation there's
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be much teeth to it since
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's administrative rather than a
 
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
Judicial inter enforcement so
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
if we really want to give teeth to it we
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
aren't giving much teeth since it's
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
administrative we do risk creating an
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
island here since we are
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
only going to be one state out of many
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
that are doing this and we are very
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
close to other states and we have cars
 
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
so I think we are not really creating uh
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
much teeth but I do think we also do
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
need to send a message that we think
 
00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
this is a important issue so while this
 
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
may not have much teeth
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
we also do need to send that message
 
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.710 align:start position:0%
we also do need to send that message
um

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
that I think that the retain at this
 
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
point may be the best way to do that and
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
we try to to work out these issues of
 
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
giving a better enforcement mechanism
 
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
perhaps than the department of a
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
Judicial remedy and work out those
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
issues uh related to uh the the
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
interstate enforcement of this you know
 
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
I think also with the interstate issue
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
there also is the a potential
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue that we may be
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
tripping over so I think retaining it is
 
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
going to address these issues that we
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
may not be seeing at the at the Frisco
 
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay representative Jackson
 
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
I I want to speak in favor of retaining
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
this there because there's the other
 
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
thing when you look into this there's
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
the Myriad of unintended consequences
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
that come along with this bill we've
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
just explored a few little dips of the
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
iceberg here in our conversation
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's not it's a valid issue
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's affected my own town and my own
 
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
well and my and so I'm very familiar
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
with the problem
 
00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
but I think that the the proper thing to
 
00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:23.579 align:start position:0%
do is retain it and come back to it and
 
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
then you're going to get testimony on
 
00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:26.839 align:start position:0%
all of the extraneous issues
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to comment on uh what
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative post indicated that
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
people would drive out of state to buy
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
their carpet and they're certainly
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
but with the law in place even if it has
 
00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:46.619 align:start position:0%
no teeth they know that what they're
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
doing is I am making a conscious
 
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.329 align:start position:0%
doing is I am making a conscious
decision

00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
to go out of state and buy something
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
and if you still want to do that knock
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
yourself out
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
but at least now they know that it is
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
detrimental to their health because up
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
to now so many people have no clue no
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
know whatever the reasons the
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental problem is there has been no
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh study you know peer review study
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
in showing the direct correlation to
 
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
pfas and cancer did you read this study
 
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
from that the representative Wendy
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.599 --> 00:45:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.290 align:start position:0%
okay I
okay

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming that once that occurs
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
then the FDA will then
 
00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:52.700 align:start position:0%
ban it so representative Gibbs
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
relatively to enforcement
 
00:45:56.809 --> 00:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
um the provision that representative
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
filio mentioned um that the Department
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services uh would be
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
empowered to adopt rules uh that would
 
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.550 align:start position:0%
empowered to adopt rules uh that would
provide

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
or at least allow for some enforcement
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
if that enforcement turns out to be
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
sufficient insufficient after this bill
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
goes into effect if it's enacted and
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
after it we've given it a chance to work
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
if it's insufficient we can come back
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
and provide it with more teeth
 
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.910 align:start position:0%
and provide it with more teeth
okay

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs yeah I'm just I
 
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
agree with retaining and I'm thinking
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
that this may be analogous to cigarettes
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
smoking where they're required to have a
 
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
notice this this may be hazardous to
 
00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
your health
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
you know um if I if I particularly if I
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
have a small child I don't want them
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
running or my my grandkids I don't want
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
them running around the carpet with this
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
stuff in it so that warning I think
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
could be very powerful I think that's a
 
00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:56.819 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
okay so uh the motion is to retain and
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
so we have this the eight people they
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
all know who they are all those in favor
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:11.329 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
yes so this is Ammon Cole Thaxton hunt
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
McAleer Herbert feel it in spear nope
 
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.290 align:start position:0%
McAleer Herbert feel it in spear nope
okay

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:20.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:22.940 align:start position:0%
one two three
 
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
four five
 
00:47:29.089 --> 00:47:29.099 align:start position:0%
not ready to retain
 
00:47:29.099 --> 00:47:32.089 align:start position:0%
not ready to retain
okay

00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:32.099 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
five to one
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me no I must be miscounty Who Am
 
00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
I who did I miss I didn't vote
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay so that's two all right so those
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
opposed to retaining
 
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
those opposed to retaining is one
 
00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.329 align:start position:0%
those opposed to retaining is one
two

00:47:47.329 --> 00:47:47.339 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
in her thoughts three okay
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
so it's five to three
 
00:47:52.980 --> 00:48:00.589 align:start position:0%
so it's five to three
okay

00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.599 --> 00:48:05.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
so the last one uh it's really a liquor
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
one just in the wrong spot okay so now
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
we're now we're moved to liquor
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so liquor everybody know
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
Burrows Sullivan and bolia okay is this
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
right is this the right list okay and I
 
00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
moved to
 
00:48:40.859 --> 00:48:42.790 align:start position:0%
moved to
OTP

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:48.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
did we get my copies of the amendment
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:01.370 align:start position:0%
 
no yeah

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.940 --> 00:50:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay so so who has the correct list of
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
the subcommittees
 
00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
because I know all right Gibbs yeah
 
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
okay that's not the right list
 
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
okay that includes it includes Osborne
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
and Vincent
 
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
but then there is no okay it's it's
 
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
eight yeah it it I'm sorry
 
00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.790 align:start position:0%
eight yeah it it I'm sorry
okay

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:53.569 --> 00:50:53.579 align:start position:0%
uh I have an amendment for this bill
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
and we're missing a committee assistant
 
00:50:59.210 --> 00:50:59.220 align:start position:0%
for me to get copies of it
 
00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.069 align:start position:0%
for me to get copies of it
so

00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:01.079 --> 00:51:02.030 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
I think what I'll do is is wait till she
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
gets back so let's just hold off on that
 
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
I can briefly describe it what it what
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
it says uh basically it says that
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
um we raised the the penalty to 7 500 we
 
00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:19.220 align:start position:0%
leave the 10 days in it but it then says
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
if the employee was not trained
 
00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:32.300 align:start position:0%
then it's 30 days automatic 30 days
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
automatic 30 days so this is a carrot
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
for restaurant owners to get their
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
employees changed or certainly get the
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
ones they think might be potential to
 
00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
over serve their employees to make sure
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
they get trained because they don't want
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
to risk being close yes and I have
 
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
gotten an okay from the Restaurant
 
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.809 align:start position:0%
gotten an okay from the Restaurant
Hospitality

00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
Hospitality
 
00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
and they and and uh and also I talked to
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
Maureen Mooney I don't know if she's
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
here but I talked to Maureen Mooney and

right
okay

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:45.410 align:start position:0%

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.089 --> 00:53:49.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.930 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:53:58.930 --> 00:53:58.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
167 relative to Nano uh Brewing license
 
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.130 align:start position:0%
167 relative to Nano uh Brewing license
okay

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding is that the
 
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
commission uh is is going ahead to
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
approve that particular location because
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
he did have a proper
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
um to but bringing up the bigger
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
question of
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
um why are we picking on Nanos when it
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
comes to uh location and that
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was just a history of the
 
00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
Nano legislation which was that um no
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
one ever visualized a beverage
 
00:54:37.329 --> 00:54:37.339 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of doing their doing having
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
manufacturing bottling canning whatever
 
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
inside their home or their Barn it was
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
only that issue only came up when it
 
00:54:47.089 --> 00:54:47.099 align:start position:0%
came up to Nanos
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
and Nanos the whole idea was that you
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
would start out at as a home business
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
and then you would expand and that's the
 
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
reason why it was written in there but
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
for all sense of purposes you can't
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
manufacture any alcohol uh in your home
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
so I I recommend that we just retain
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
this bill so that uh a we can see what's
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
coming over from the Senate and B is
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
that we then kind of clarify that that
 
00:55:13.609 --> 00:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
this is not something we're picking on
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
Nanos but rather than this is true for
 
00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
anybody who's manufacturing
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan yeah so I mean
 
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
this is more procedural I don't really
 
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
know how the process works but yep
 
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:25.270 align:start position:0%
know how the process works but yep
um

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
we can retain it but I I guess my gut is
 
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
we should probably pass it or I would I
 
00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:31.940 align:start position:0%
think we should ought to pass it because
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
there is something coming out of the
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
Senate which supposedly will maybe take
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
care of this but there's a lot of other
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
things in that bill which might make it
 
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
not pass to me it seems like a very
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
sensible build we're literally taking
 
00:55:43.809 --> 00:55:43.819 align:start position:0%
out what like four words or something
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
and so I I would motion to pass whatever
 
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
the right way to do it is and then I
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what the process is you would
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
know better than I uh if the Senate bill
 
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
passes and we like it and it's going to
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
pass here then does it just supersede
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
this or does that create some sort of
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
problem down the line
 
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.630 align:start position:0%
problem down the line
um

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
and again I I listened in on the Senate
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
hearing on their bill but I had did not
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
have it I didn't pull it up
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh if they're if they're crossing over
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
the same RSA
 
00:56:20.569 --> 00:56:20.579 align:start position:0%
um but the uh
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
then there is it can be a potential
 
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
conflict so in that case the the Senate
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
would probably just kill our bill so I
 
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
mean you know so so it would not take it
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
but my my only concern with saying that
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
is is I don't want if us if we were to
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
repeal that
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
section it would theoretically say okay
 
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
we've solved this problem for him so he
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
can get his Nano license well there are
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
other people too like I I researched
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
this and there's been multiple other
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
ones he's not the only example of
 
00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:53.460 align:start position:0%
mistake there's at least four or five I
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
was able to come up with to have better
 
00:56:57.049 --> 00:56:57.059 align:start position:0%
have the exact same problem that they
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
were forced to take a full beverage
 
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
license rather than a nano license yeah
 
00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:02.819 align:start position:0%
so this is not unique to him he's just
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
the one who brought it okay so I guess I
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know the that
 
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
um we need again we need let's see what
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
there's I mean just it seemed logical to
 
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
take this out I what they're saying is
 
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
it's still law it's federal law
 
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
no I understand so I was taking out our
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
law the one thing that scares me about
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
taking out of our law
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
is that someone says oh I can do it
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
because the state state doesn't escape
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
repealed it so therefore I can do it but
 
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
the federal law is still in effect so
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
like with this example he had to work
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
with the federal regulators and he did
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
and they approved that exactly so I mean
 
00:57:42.049 --> 00:57:42.059 align:start position:0%
there's some level of enforcement going
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
on at the federal level which presumably
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
would still have to occur
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
and that's what I would want to I would
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
rather see that in the our statute but
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
not just for Nano
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
for everybody in other words to say is
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
oh you're okay because you you can go
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
get your beverage license
 
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.410 align:start position:0%
get your beverage license
no

00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:04.329 align:start position:0%
no
no

00:58:04.329 --> 00:58:04.339 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
so you're saying there's four other
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
people doing it I'd love to know who
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
those four are yeah because I I like to
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
hear their story and see what happened
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
here how did the feds have a problem
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
with their location or what they were
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
doing so then I'm somehow I feel like
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
we're not getting the full story
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
you follow me because it's against
 
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
it's against federal law in your
 
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
dwelling but in this case that we know
 
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:30.980 align:start position:0%
with the man the gentleman who testified
 
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
the federal the federal Regulators were
 
00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:35.339 align:start position:0%
totally okay with it it was the state
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
that caused the problem correct and so

uh okay this is a late delivery
 
00:58:59.450 --> 00:58:59.460 align:start position:0%

00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
so Chief are you aware that there are
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
four other locations that have you have
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
to speak to the microphone
 
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
there are four other locations that have
 
00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
and committee members uh yes we we've
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
identified probably
 
00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say approximately six that
 
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
we are reaching out to to do the same
 
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
assessment that we did with the
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
gentleman that we spoke of that
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
testified last week
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
um to we we don't know if they fall into
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
this same scenario but we're willing to
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
go to come to the table and see if they
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
do or not under the standard that we're
 
00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
holding everybody to our interpretation
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
of it okay so we don't have to take
 
01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
action on this bill yet because this is
 
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
a late delivery so we will have another
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and we hope you can tell us
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
how you resolve all for real five people
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
or whatever six say people make sure
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
it's all taken care of absolutely okay
 
01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:18.970 align:start position:0%
it's all taken care of absolutely okay
great

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:18.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
no we're not going to do anything with
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
this bill right now because it could be
 
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.609 align:start position:0%
this bill right now because it could be
passed

01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
because the amendment I would drive past
 
01:00:30.049 --> 01:00:30.059 align:start position:0%
is you know if it gets Federal approval
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%

voting against itl say why sure
 
01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
um I know that and I thought my I
 
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
thought my team was Voting um was not
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
voting itl I guess I was wrong
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
um I know that the concern is that we're
 
01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
going to be putting out uh maybe uh
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
hurting some businesses but and um my
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
feeling is we're also going to be really
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
damaging human beings lives
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
that's why I can't vote vote for Ito
 
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.569 align:start position:0%
that's why I can't vote vote for Ito
okay

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
I it was stated a couple of different
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
times that it takes the control away
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
from Concord
 
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
really you know it takes the control
 
01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
away from us uh to set the tax and uh
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
and it was going to put it in the uh the
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
department of revenues administration's
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%

missing walls so I have the vote is six
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.799 --> 01:05:20.030 align:start position:0%

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
wine we do have a de minimis license
 
01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:03.500 align:start position:0%
already for wine
 
01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
and uh so how many were they how many uh
 
01:06:10.609 --> 01:06:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:12.299 align:start position:0%
I can pull it up
 
01:06:12.299 --> 01:06:16.309 align:start position:0%
I can pull it up
um

01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
getting that information for you now sir
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
so de minimis license this was the issue
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
is if you're just a Farm Stand a farm
 
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
and you want to make wine
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
so you can get a
 
01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
license to make wine
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
and sell it there on your farm and the
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
license is a hundred dollars
 
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
36 out of 50 that are under 30 36 36 out
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
of 50. out of 50. so that means there
 
01:06:48.529 --> 01:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
are more of these people than
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
than who really are making uh more wine
 
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
or over a thousand thousand was it more
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
than a thousand cases chairman thousand
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
cases which just seems like a lot of
 
01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
wine so then the next question I said is
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
so of those 36 who are at this five
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
percent they're paying the five percent
 
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
how much are they contributing to the
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
tax revenue
 
01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
which is think about it now they're the
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
majority there's 36 of them more so that
 
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
that is approximately 108 000 which
 
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
represents about a third of the total
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
revenue okay so there are a third of the
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
revenue but they're and they're
 
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
generating a hundred and eight
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
so the question is in this the way the
 
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
bill was presented it had two parts to
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
it had one was uh I don't know release
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
of all the fees or something in other
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
words to get rid of the tax is that am I
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
correcting with the what was in the bill
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
someone have a copy of the bill
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
there were several aspects to this bill
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
the first was changing the sample sizes
 
01:07:55.849 --> 01:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
we're not going to change sample sizes
 
01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh the second was changing the uh tax
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
um code the fee codes so it was 50 cents
 
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
a gallon changing it to 50 cents a
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
gallon right okay correct
 
01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
as opposed to five percent of uh the
 
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:11.569 align:start position:0%
as opposed to five percent of uh the
sales

01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
sales
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
and then the last section uh was an
 
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
added paragraph
 
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
um regarding the exemption of 100
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
gallons per year for a household with
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
more than with one person and up to 200
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
gallons of wine per year for a household
 
01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
with two or more people uh from the tax
 
01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:34.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to pay any tax right
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
correct right so I guess that's where I
 
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
was focused in on 50 cents a gallon that
 
01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
seems really awkward to because you
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
don't we don't really have that in our
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
system to be able to apply that tax
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
right that's correct chairman
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
yes it's beer but beer the tax uh
 
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
reporting is done by the beer
 
01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:58.849 align:start position:0%
reporting is done by the beer
manufacturers

01:08:58.849 --> 01:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
the commission doesn't come in and when
 
01:09:04.209 --> 01:09:04.219 align:start position:0%
they do audit it but they they don't
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
and and you know obviously
 
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
the reason why we had set the five
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
percent was that they
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
um in lieu of a fact that that we're not
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
selling them through the commission
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
which was really the bottom line for us
 
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
is the state of New Hampshire is that
 
01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
um when when the prohibition ended we
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
gave beer we let beer go through
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
Distributors and wine and distilled was
 
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to go through the commission
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
commission was making all that margin uh
 
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
before my time
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
so don't blame me before my time the uh
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
the legislature and his wisdom did
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
decide to allow wine to be sold through
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
the same channel as the beer
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
distributors I.E convenience stores and
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
grocery stores and at that time
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
um the the uh margin it was then is that
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're buying it from the
 
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
commission and there's a discount uh
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's the only discount I know in the
 
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
world in which the more you buy the
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
lower your discount is but if we got
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
away with that for somehow
 
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
um but but notwithstanding that if you
 
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
are uh self-distributing that wine so
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
you're not going through the commission
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
and you're bringing that wine into the
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
retail outlets
 
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
um that and or you're selling it
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
yourself that's where the five percent
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
kicks in that's where the five percent
 
01:10:33.649 --> 01:10:33.659 align:start position:0%
tax kicked in
 
01:10:33.659 --> 01:10:35.149 align:start position:0%
tax kicked in
so

01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:35.159 --> 01:10:36.110 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.010 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is an early departure so we have to
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
make a decision on what to do with this
 
01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.990 align:start position:0%
make a decision on what to do with this
bill

01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
um we don't have to do it today we can
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
wait a week we can think about this but
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
the question I you know was is it uh is
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
it worth it to reduce the tax I mean
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
we're already making the fee pretty de
 
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
minimis I mean it's 100 fun you know
 
01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
feed seems pretty pre-de minimis uh to
 
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
whether we really want to mess around
 
01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:18.140 align:start position:0%
with the tax
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm leaving it up into what
 
01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
the committee committee feels about this
 
01:11:24.659 --> 01:11:25.729 align:start position:0%
the committee committee feels about this
bill

01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:11:25.739 --> 01:11:27.110 align:start position:0%
bill
representative

01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you what would be the
 
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
difference in Revenue if we went to 50
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
cents a gallon versus five percent
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I do have those
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
that would be in the fiscal note right
 
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
uh it is but very quickly so you don't
 
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
have to go through that on on your own
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
the total revenue that was brought in uh
 
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
based on the five percent in 2021 was 30
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
367 thousand dollars approximately
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
um that's based on the five percent of
 
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
sales if those same Figures were
 
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
calculated at the 50 cents a gallon uh
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
it would be approximately an 87 percent
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
loss in revenue and equate to forty
 
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollars approximately
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
and and we do have a a constitutional
 
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
requirement that our taxes is equal and
 
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.709 align:start position:0%
requirement that our taxes is equal and
proportionate

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
proportionate
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
so to reduce the tax to one group of
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
people is technically unconstitutional
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
so

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
what do you mean it would reduce it then
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
I would say the beer well in other words
 
01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
no no that that's that would be apples
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
and oranges so that if let's say we said
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay for those people who are the small
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
manufacturers you know these these under
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
a thousand who are only paying a hundred
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
dollar fee if we were to reduce their
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
tax rate and not reduce the total tax
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
rate and remove reduce the five percent
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
because let's face it that five percent
 
01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:00.179 align:start position:0%
is probably you know the majority of
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
that is probably paced by
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
um the Mead guy uh midnight meenery and
 
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
and uh and LaBelle
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
I mean probably there's a hand I don't
 
01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
know there's a couple of them could firm
 
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of guys that make a lot
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
you know who make play the fight Lion
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
Share of that so that would be dis
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's that because of the same category
 
01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
they're both wine they're doing you
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
can't have different tax rates in other
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
so yeah representative Vinson
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I just want to
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
give you my spin on this
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
um we heard a testimony uh from one of
 
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers of a wine a winery uh
 
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
which is very few wineries
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
what I took from her and her testimony
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
very few wineries so when I look at this
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
as his three pots to this bill uh so we
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
start with number one allowing wine
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to give a bottle example
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think that's a big deal
 
01:14:05.209 --> 01:14:05.219 align:start position:0%
I really don't uh however I think the
 
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
other two do affect taxes and whatever
 
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
it may be for the state but um so I'm
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
not sure I mean I don't like all of this
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill but I would be certainly for a wine
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
producer which is so many so few of in
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
the state to give a bottle of wine into
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
sample wine uh I don't have a problem
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
the other two about changing taxes I
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'm for that but I just
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring that to the committee uh
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
I hope I'm hope I'm staying this
 
01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
correctly I mean this is what I'm seeing
 
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
here from my recollection and notes
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
yes where where is that giving the
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine uh
 
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
for a first part of the bill allowing uh
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
we are on 612 right yeah okay sometimes
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
that's happened too sorry but allowing
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
wine manufacturers to give a bottle uh
 
01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
as a sample under certain conditions
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
and her testimony was that there's only
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
I believe two or three wine
 
01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.510 align:start position:0%
I believe two or three wine
manufacturers

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
in a state that actually grow the grapes
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
and do the wine or one maybe it was
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to kind of give the wine
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
away because they didn't actually meet
 
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
the food requirements if I'm correct so
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
do they really want to give the bottle
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
away or do they want it in charge rooms
 
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
and meals taxes
 
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
oh it states here to give a bottle of
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
the sample under this what line are you
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
looking at uh uh right under the bill
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
right first one allowing wine
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to give a bottle
 
01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
as a sample under certain conditions
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
I think it's a line 11. yeah I see that
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm on the front of the bill
 
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
right so they're going from you're going
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
from the two ounce glass per person and
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
then a full
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
open bottle of wine to groups of two or
 
01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.169 align:start position:0%
open bottle of wine to groups of two or
more

01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
we got two or more right so there's more
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
than one part to this I see it's more
 
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
than just a tax it's
 
01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.229 align:start position:0%
than just a tax it's
well

01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff going on yeah
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I get you I just want to bring it
 
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
right so I guess the discussion is
 
01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
someone's coming in and taking a sample
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the wine
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
and they can and under our law they can
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
either uh charge for that sample or or
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
if they want to they they wouldn't have
 
01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:30.179 align:start position:0%
they collect the rooms and meals tags
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know meals tax or they can just give
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
that sample for free
 
01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
and so then now you've cracked the book
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
The Bottle open and that's the only
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
person that day is going to come in
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
because this is a little standoff in the
 
01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
country but I also think that it has
 
01:16:45.649 --> 01:16:45.659 align:start position:0%
something to do if the committee
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
remembers correctly about them having
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
the license to to give or sell the
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
bottle because of non not being able to
 
01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
meet the food requirement
 
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
I mean am I the only one who
 
01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:04.090 align:start position:0%
I mean am I the only one who
scooters

01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
food requirements when is the food
 
01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
requirement I don't know the food we
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
ever had the food we're worried about
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
the food requirement because we did that
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
for the Nanos okay so the Nanos we did
 
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
we had we had a nano Plus
 
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
and a nano plus was if you had a food
 
01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:21.590 align:start position:0%
and a nano plus was if you had a food
truck

01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
truck
 
01:17:24.649 --> 01:17:24.659 align:start position:0%
okay but at the end of the day the the
 
01:17:24.659 --> 01:17:26.270 align:start position:0%
okay but at the end of the day the the
the

01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
um the Nano only can give away only he
 
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
can give a he can a sample is a glass a
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
pint he can give a pint
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
rather than just one because we were
 
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
thinking the Nano guy won't have a lot
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
you know so but those Nano guys are not
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
giving that Pine away
 
01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
they're they're charging for it right
 
01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:50.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
you know I I hate to kill the bill
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
because I don't know I guess I don't
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
know all the nuances in there I I would
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
say is I have a problem with the 50 Cent
 
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
a gallon tax because of you know the
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
five percent it's got to be across the
 
01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.590 align:start position:0%
five percent it's got to be across the
board

01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
um we already have the hundred dollar
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
fee so I really don't see and we don't
 
01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.050 align:start position:0%
fee so I really don't see and we don't
have

01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:14.060 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
the ban on it for growing it in your
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
making the wine inside your house right
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's not in this statute
 
01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.070 align:start position:0%
that's not in this statute
um

01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I mean I all my notes
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
basically I think it was a logical thing
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
but this is the first I've heard about
 
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
it potentially being unconstitutional so
 
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
I think that's something we should
 
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
explore well that's unconstitutional if
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
we were to decide not to we would apply
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
that 50 Cents Only to the small guy
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
right right okay but to go 50 cents a
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
gallon across the board we're going to
 
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
lose 800 800 000 dollars
 
01:18:53.689 --> 01:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
right right
 
01:18:53.699 --> 01:18:54.790 align:start position:0%
right right
but

01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
actually correct me if I'm wrong it
 
01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
would be considerably more because if we
 
01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
were to do it across the board we're
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
talking about every bottle of wine
 
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
that's sold no this is only yeah well
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's only yeah no he's he's done that
 
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
all the way across the board so I don't
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
know no he he's doing it only for these
 
01:19:17.649 --> 01:19:17.659 align:start position:0%
this group of of small wine producers
 
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
across the board for all wines no for
 
01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:22.739 align:start position:0%
all wines no that would be no we don't
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
charge five percent tax on that
 
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
because we're only charging a five
 
01:19:29.209 --> 01:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
percent tax no as a matter of fact we
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
don't have a five percent tax we have a
 
01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:33.659 align:start position:0%
25 to 30 percent margin
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
when we sell those wines
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
okay there's no tax involved the five
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
percent tax is only if you're bypassing
 
01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:52.510 align:start position:0%
isn't this petusic's bill
 
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:59.090 align:start position:0%
isn't this petusic's bill
[Laughter]

01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
you want to separate it I I would just
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
assume retaining because I would like to
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
I would like to
 
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
I would like to think about how they're
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
selling in other words the terms of as
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
comparing it to the Nano guys again
 
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.130 align:start position:0%
comparing it to the Nano guys again
um

01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
I mean they can they're certainly
 
01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
selling a bottle of wine if it's corked
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
and then and it's funny they're going on
 
01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
in the old corking law
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
The Unfinished wine
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
how they how they they brought that
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
Statute in
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:35.219 align:start position:0%
I mean theoretically they could sell
 
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
that whole bottle right even though it's
 
01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
been cracked open and a sample was given
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
they could that's correct they could
 
01:20:45.010 --> 01:20:45.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
what does this language do what does
 
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
this language do what different what is
 
01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
this doing different than its current
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
law so the only thing that I can surmise
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
out of this and thank you chairman is
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
increasing the
 
01:20:59.090 --> 01:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh sample sizes from six ounces from
 
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
five ounces to six ounces right for two
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
samples that's 12 ounces per person
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
and 24 ounces per two people
 
01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
a standard 750 milliliter bottle is 25
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
ounces so they're saying I believe what
 
01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
the intent here is if you serve four
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
glasses or wine two for per person at
 
01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's crazy but we don't really care
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
that it's a bottle that's that's just a
 
01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
it's a meaningless that's correct it's a
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
red herring if you ask me because we we
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
would say you can you can easily sell
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
that bottle cork it and take it away
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
because the restaurant license has and
 
01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
the way this language reads I I would
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
like to bring up that again this is
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
essentially making a wine bar out of a
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
wine manufacturing license
 
01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
so this it's not only a bottle it's
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
bottles for two or more people there's
 
01:21:59.689 --> 01:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
no limit right right and that that you
 
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
know we were we've kind of held the line
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
on that with Nanos
 
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.490 align:start position:0%
on that with Nanos
so

01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:05.870 align:start position:0%
so
okay

01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I guess we could kill it sorry John
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
right does anybody anybody think
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise anybody anybody feel sorry for
 
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:27.229 align:start position:0%
otherwise anybody anybody feel sorry for
drawing

01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.239 --> 01:22:30.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
no we can't
 
01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:33.770 align:start position:0%
no we can't
yeah

01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
we gotta kill it
 
01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.590 align:start position:0%
we gotta kill it
okay

01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
no no no no okay
 
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.350 align:start position:0%
no no no no okay
uh

01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.159 --> 01:22:54.649 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:22:54.649 --> 01:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
do people rather retain it with rather
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
retain it or
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
know if you put so I'm not gonna put my
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
name on it bro yes
 
01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
okay representative Sullivan
 
01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh all right so the motion is in
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
experience to legislate
 
01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
and we have seven people here all those
 
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
in favor of the motion raise your hand
 
01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:25.330 align:start position:0%
in favor of the motion raise your hand
one

01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:25.340 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
three four
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
it's seven okay great and Mr chairman if
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
I could just uh say that maybe it being
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
Rewritten and coming back again would be
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
a better thing because it was a little
 
01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
out of character so to speak it was just
 
01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
it was a laundry room it was I mean I
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
think they had a good point but I just
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
think it was Rewritten right but and I
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
guess I my problem mistake was I forgot
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
that we had already
 
01:23:59.570 --> 01:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
created the 100 license right so that's
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
where I thought it had legs is to make
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:12.490 --> 01:24:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
legalization and regulation okay so um I
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
have sent out everyone a uh a new new
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
version right
 
01:24:23.209 --> 01:24:23.219 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure none of you have had a
 
01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
chance to read through it but or see the
 
01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:29.630 align:start position:0%
chance to read through it but or see the
analysis

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
um I guess what I will definitely be
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
scheduling this again next week uh and
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh for anybody in the audience who's
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
um uh you can ask Carrie which sometimes
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
she's at her desk to have her email it
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
to you or you can ask any member of the
 
01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
committee to email it to you
 
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
um and so that you can see where where
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're at with an amendment
 
01:24:56.209 --> 01:24:56.219 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
I think this amendment uh will hopefully
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh survive the test of time when it
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
goes over to the other body and to the
 
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:10.940 align:start position:0%
um because it it is definitely a hybrid
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
but it uses I I I would like to say is
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
if I were there in the room back in 1933
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:34.030 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
my hair was truly platinum blonde no
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
um that um I'm sure when they made that
 
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
decision to go through to create the
 
01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and to say this is
 
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
something that clearly a lot of people
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
is very concerned about how it's being
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
made available to the public
 
01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:54.620 align:start position:0%
um they they
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
resigned they went to this commission
 
01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
idea uh knowing that that theoretically
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
we the state can control a what's in
 
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
there knowing more what's what's knowing
 
01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
it's safe and no it's not you know what
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
the safety of the product knowing where
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
it came from and B is that it it was
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
certainly uh would reduce the risk of
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
selling it to underage people uh and uh
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I thinking that that maybe is
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
probably the right way to go
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
and anyway I'm hoping yes representative
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
Osborne I think just to clarify when you
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
said you're scheduling this again for
 
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
next week will that be a public hearing
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
or another work session um I am not
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
treating this as a non-germaine
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm treating this as a very as
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
a germane Amendment so that will be the
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
time in which the subcommittee would
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
vote on it but I I didn't think
 
01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
everybody had a chance to read it and so
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why I'm scheduling
 
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee next week and but
 
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
then we would vote on it so uh in terms
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
of next week we would do
 
01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at Thursday morning
 
01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
Thursday morning subcommittees and then
 
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
bringing the amendment forward
 
01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.570 align:start position:0%
bringing the amendment forward
so

01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:13.030 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
I I hope this is a Commerce Amendment
 
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
rather than take total ownership for it
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
for myself
 
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
but I would hope that that everybody in
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
the committee can feel that you're
 
01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of who I work with
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
um is I I my focus was making sure that
 
01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
it was enforceable and structurally can
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
can work within the system that we have
 
01:27:38.639 --> 01:27:40.070 align:start position:0%
can work within the system that we have
now

01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
and the amendment does that does that
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
and I sent it out yeah I sent it out
 
01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
this morning oh this morning
 
01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:49.250 align:start position:0%
this morning oh this morning
we

01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
should yes you'll have it in your having
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
your email did I send it out last night
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
oh I said it out last night I'm sorry I
 
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
did send it out last night
 
01:27:59.810 --> 01:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gibbs uh thanks um
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
just a question
 
01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.510 align:start position:0%
just a question
um

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
why is this bill being considered
 
01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:08.219 align:start position:0%
separately from house bill 544. so 544
 
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
is not an early bill
 
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
this one is early
 
01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:15.649 align:start position:0%
this one is early
so

01:28:15.649 --> 01:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
um that's why I chose to do it this way
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
but I would say that the other one the
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
544 was heavily used in the structure of
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
so that's why I would call it a hybrid
 
01:28:32.689 --> 01:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
of the two
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
and that was last year's bill that did
 
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
pass the house over Wembley last year I
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
um usually when we have two bills like
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
that we we would hold on to the second
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
one as a retain so that we have a
 
01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
vehicle to work on something if if the
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
other one didn't have the outcome that
 
01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
we were hoping for
 
01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:11.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and and I would say that
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
that I was keenly aware that I I didn't
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
think it was a good idea to have state
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
employees selling a state unionized
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
and then we would have the other one in
 
01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.610 align:start position:0%
and then we would have the other one in
case

01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:53.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.610 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
stay tuned to next week on that one
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
all right and last but not least
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
repealing the drug affordability bill
 
01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:09.890 align:start position:0%
repealing the drug affordability bill
okay

01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
I've been to one
 
01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:12.490 align:start position:0%
I've been to one
um

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:12.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%
um why is repealing the drug
 
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
affordability board on the liquor
 
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.770 align:start position:0%
affordability board on the liquor
subcommittee

01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:30:28.129 --> 01:30:28.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.139 --> 01:30:30.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
I guess I was thinking that we needed to
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
move on this one that this had an early
 
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
departure date I think is
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't so never mind we don't
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
we don't need to discuss it
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
and it's not an early bill right
 
01:30:55.739 --> 01:30:57.410 align:start position:0%
and it's not an early bill right
okay

01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute now I do have one more
 
01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:06.050 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute now I do have one more
um

01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:22.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:39.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's awesome right okay so unfortunately
 
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
she's still not here
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
um so what it will do is I will I will
 
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
email that out to everyone
 
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
um but it what I'll do is uh given that
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it a little bit and
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
everybody feels somewhat comfortable
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
with it I will go ahead and have the
 
01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
amendment drawn up so that we'll be
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
ready for the next for next week to to
 
01:32:04.930 --> 01:32:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:07.090 align:start position:0%
 
279.

01:32:07.090 --> 01:32:07.100 align:start position:0%
279.
 
01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:09.010 align:start position:0%
279.
okay

01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:09.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
so if anybody has a problem with it with
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
this by turning this into a carrot
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
please let me know what you think but it
 
01:32:21.490 --> 01:32:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah but
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
this is purposes we're making an
 
01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
mandatory protection because that means
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
if you have one employee who's over
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
served somebody you're shut down for 30
 
01:32:34.729 --> 01:32:34.739 align:start position:0%
days and what I've heard is if you're
 
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
shut down for 30 days you're you're done
 
01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:47.830 align:start position:0%
shut down for 30 days you're you're done
yeah

01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
I guess we'll have to talk to the mic
 
01:32:54.370 --> 01:32:54.380 align:start position:0%
because theoretically this is public
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
we'll just I remember uh the objections
 
01:32:59.450 --> 01:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
that representative Sullivan had that
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
there were only like three cases that uh
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission had to look into I
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
mean yeah I guess I can speak
 
01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
to minimize it was to Minimus let me let
 
01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
me say my point
 
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a hundred cases where
 
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
people walked out of the bar totally
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
zongo and didn't get in an accident and
 
01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
and those are the ones that we want to
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
prevent so it's not a case of the ones
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
that got caught it's a case of the
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
potential one so I I just don't think
 
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
that was a good argument that's all
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:36.850 --> 01:33:36.860 align:start position:0%
ouch oh well
 
01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
are we talking about now I mean I can we
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
theoretically I did say where this this
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
was unfinished off in this argument
 
01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:49.739 align:start position:0%
until we see the thing where we can go
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
at it now
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day you're okay
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
with our
 
01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.229 align:start position:0%
with our
um

01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:59.470 --> 01:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
with the amendment the amendment saying
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
that that if the employee was untracked
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
I was the one who was on our caucus was
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
the most opposed to this bill which is
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
why he's referencing ah gotcha that's
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
where this is coming from right so how
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
I don't really like the bill in general
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
I think uh this is my personal view
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's a very sad story yeah and it
 
01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
moved all of us who heard it but I don't
 
01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
think that this would have saved her
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
life and I don't think that this would
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
will prevent things like that in the
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
future and I think it's a solution in
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
search of a problem and it looks like
 
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's something we're gonna do that may
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
have unintended consequences which for
 
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
me are concerning
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
the bar community and bar culture
 
01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
everybody thinks the negative it they
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
think of people going there and getting
 
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
wasted and driving home and
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
irresponsible things which do happen I
 
01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
don't dispute that I think as long as we
 
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
have legalized alcohol that we're going
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
to have those issues but my bigger
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
concern is the potential unattended
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
consequences of chilling the bar culture
 
01:35:02.219 --> 01:35:04.250 align:start position:0%
consequences of chilling the bar culture
and

01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
some people might be okay with that you
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
might be okay with that though if you're
 
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
somebody who doesn't frequent bars or
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand some of those bars
 
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
but when you do go to a really busy bar
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's a lot to ask for a bartender to be
 
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
able to identify somebody who maybe has
 
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
had too much to drink and there if
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's three or four hundred people in
 
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
there and you're like serving them
 
01:35:25.729 --> 01:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
within 30 seconds like it's hard to
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
evaluate that they might go to other
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
bars or other bartenders so nobody has a
 
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
real accurate account on that and I
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
think when people are talking about bars
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of people in this room
 
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
probably are going to places where it's
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
a sit-down bar not the stand-up Club
 
01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
type bar that people in their 20s are
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
going to and and those those
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
establishments for all the negative that
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
they get on the news or also bring a lot
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
of positive to our society in terms of
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
people meeting their spouses there
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
people socializing they move to a
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
community that's where they start to
 
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
make friends like putting a chill in
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
unintended chilling consequence on that
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
industry I think is something we need to
 
01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
think about and and I think
 
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
this is a very tragic story I don't know
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
that this law the way it's mended or the
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
law that's on the books now is going to
 
01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:13.310 align:start position:0%
law that's on the books now is going to
prevent

01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
anything I really don't think it will so
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's my view and I think we need to
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
really be cognizant of my chill being
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
industry well let's go back to his
 
01:36:23.689 --> 01:36:23.699 align:start position:0%
original statement which is I think we
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
should just mandate
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
that everybody gets the training
 
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
well we know that doesn't work because
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
the employee could only be there for a
 
01:36:33.649 --> 01:36:33.659 align:start position:0%
week and then you decided they're not
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
going to work out so mandating that is
 
01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
not a good idea but if we could
 
01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:41.209 align:start position:0%
not a good idea but if we could
incentivize

01:36:41.209 --> 01:36:41.219 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
the owners of the of the bars and
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
restaurants incentivize them to get that
 
01:36:46.679 --> 01:36:48.050 align:start position:0%
restaurants incentivize them to get that
training

01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
but again I mean what's the difference
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
because that that if your argument is
 
01:36:52.729 --> 01:36:52.739 align:start position:0%
that you can't mandate it because they
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
might only be there for a week they
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
might only be there for weekly
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
incentivize or you mandate it right it's
 
01:36:59.209 --> 01:36:59.219 align:start position:0%
like see to me it seems like the exact
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
same thing you can incentivize all you
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
want if that if that bartender is there
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
for three weeks and they leave just like
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
if it's mandated it's the same problem
 
01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
we haven't solved a problem well but it
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
goes back to the decision by the
 
01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:12.550 align:start position:0%
goes back to the decision by the
commission

01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:37:15.649 --> 01:37:15.659 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
where they found fault to the owner to
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
the restaurant owner was that no
 
01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:24.130 align:start position:0%
employee had training at all
 
01:37:24.130 --> 01:37:25.610 align:start position:0%
employee had training at all
[Music]

01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
and so we're saying is how do we how do
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
we get over that hump because we didn't
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
mandate it
 
01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
that we want we want them to to get that
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
training because hopefully then that way
 
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
the the commission would not have to use
 
01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
that as a reason for why that over
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
serving so occurred I mean if if the
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
owners are training their staff right
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
like I guess it's through the liquor
 
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
commission's website or whatever they
 
01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
have some sort of yeah yes how effective
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
that is I think we should discuss too I
 
01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
don't I haven't seen it but I would be
 
01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
very curious I mean I think honestly if
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're gonna just get it out in the open
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
is it going to be any different than
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
when I sat in my all my corporate jobs
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
and I had to do sexual harassment
 
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
training like does it actually teach you
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
like we had here
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
a state house you did go to it right I
 
01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
didn't go to that no I got good at it
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
after the last 15 years of uh sitting
 
01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
but no my point is how effective are
 
01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:22.139 align:start position:0%
these training maybe they're good maybe
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
they're not or is that just like a way
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
to to hide it but
 
01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I think that would be an interesting
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
thing to understand if we think we're
 
01:38:29.159 --> 01:38:30.530 align:start position:0%
thing to understand if we think we're
just

01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
do we think it's going to be effective
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
are we passing a law that can have
 
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and it's really
 
01:38:37.729 --> 01:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
going to accomplish nothing and I think
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
if we're doing it simply because it's a
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
really sad story and we feel like we
 
01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
need to react because of a sad story
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
because that's not a good reason but if
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing it because we truly believe
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
it's going to lead to a safer better
 
01:38:51.169 --> 01:38:51.179 align:start position:0%
society and it's worth the unintended
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
consequences then fine but I think we
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
need to think about it in that light and
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
not just simply knee-jerk reaction sad
 
01:38:58.010 --> 01:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
story better do something okay
 
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative thackson
 
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.530 align:start position:0%
representative thackson
so

01:39:02.530 --> 01:39:02.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
here's you know I didn't I thought
 
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
here's the here's the thing
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to tell you that I'm
 
01:39:11.689 --> 01:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
probably the only person in this room I
 
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
hope I'm the only person in this room
 
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
that can say this but I had a daughter
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
who was killed under similar
 
01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
circumstances Jesus so
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
I understand the pain
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
if we want to talk about training
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
bartenders or bar managers
 
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
I think that may be a really good
 
01:39:37.129 --> 01:39:37.139 align:start position:0%
conversation but that's not what this
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
and you know you could have bartenders
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
bar managers who get licenses like they
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
do in other states issued by the Liquor
 
01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
Commission however that and again this
 
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
is and that license travels with that
 
01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:53.930 align:start position:0%
is and that license travels with that
individual

01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
rather than that solves the problem of
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
every time I hire a bartender I have to
 
01:40:00.169 --> 01:40:00.179 align:start position:0%
train them you hire a trained person and
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
then it's more on them
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
so the point is
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is defective because
 
01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
it is a bill where it wants to address a
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
person's personal pain
 
01:40:17.209 --> 01:40:17.219 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really fix the problem is
 
01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
there really a difference if I'm running
 
01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
a bar in Keene and I'm doing twenty
 
01:40:24.410 --> 01:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a night is there really
 
01:40:26.209 --> 01:40:26.219 align:start position:0%
a difference between twenty five hundred
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
dollars and seventy five hundred dollars
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think so
 
01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
so the only real achievement of this
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill is I now have to paint a Scarlet
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
Letter on my door that says when I'm
 
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
closed for no we I took that one that's
 
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
out so I think I think there's an issue
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this bill
 
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
achieves that right but but it was the
 
01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
training piece the training if you have
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
that right I'm saying that's where we
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
turn this bill into is an is a carrot to
 
01:40:56.090 --> 01:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
get training
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
okay that's
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's I still don't think it fixes up I
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
think there's a better way to do the
 
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
training and then you get in the whole
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
go down the get out in the Weeds on how
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
you can do the training representative
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
spear I'm going around so you guys you
 
01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
know I know you all want to speak
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
I think that I think it's
 
01:41:19.129 --> 01:41:19.139 align:start position:0%
thank you I I think that the bill is
 
01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
lacking I went and looked at what they
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
do in other states and other states
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
include jail sentences shutting down all
 
01:41:29.090 --> 01:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff that we're not even
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
but I do believe that the bar that is
 
01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
busy enough that it's making all this
 
01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
kind of money
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
needs to do something need and and
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
you're right I don't know the solution
 
01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:44.699 align:start position:0%
and hearing these these other things
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
just because a bar is busy that doesn't
 
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
mean that we let them off the hook this
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
bill is not maybe not thorough enough
 
01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
because I think if we look at some other
 
01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
states we'll find some really thorough
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
stuff that's happening
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I'm saying okay
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
letting everybody off the hook
 
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs uh thank you uh
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
regarding the effectiveness of training
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
um there was just a comparison made
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
between the effectiveness of this kind
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
of training for bartenders and uh sexual
 
01:42:19.490 --> 01:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
harassment training and as someone who
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
has actually done a lot of sexual
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
harassment training over many years uh
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
and who also attended the recent
 
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
legislative sexual harassment training
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh I can say that one of the uh
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
important ways in which it is effective
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
and I think also the training discussed
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
here can also be effective is it wakes
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
people up to the problem and that's a
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
very important element there you go and
 
01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
representative McVay you have the last
 
01:42:48.659 --> 01:42:49.790 align:start position:0%
representative McVay you have the last
word

01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
um I talked to my friend the bartender
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
or the owner of Wildcat Tavern yeah and
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
he's telling me that the training is
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
quite frankly not effective it's it
 
01:43:03.050 --> 01:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
that's where it really I realize this is
 
01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
an incentive to to train but I think the
 
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission should come out with a
 
01:43:10.609 --> 01:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
very stringent training program and and
 
01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
take it out and make people do it I
 
01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
think that's the real yeah but don't you
 
01:43:16.609 --> 01:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
think the reason he said that to you is
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
to to explain to you why he never
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
enforced his police to do it no he he
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
said I'm willing to pay a hundred
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
dollars per employee to have them
 
01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
trained properly but he doesn't you can
 
01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
do he could do it outside he could go
 
01:43:30.890 --> 01:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
out and get another training course he
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to use the state course I
 
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
think he's recognizing that and quite
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
frankly might do that okay good so that
 
01:43:38.530 --> 01:43:38.540 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
all right with that we will close our
 
01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:50.570 align:start position:0%
all right with that we will close our
subcommittee

01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
I I think the other thing I don't like
 
01:43:56.209 --> 01:43:56.219 align:start position:0%
about this bill in general but you're
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
saying that just because that bar is
 
01:44:02.649 --> 01:44:02.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
Eric I don't think that's what he was
 
01:44:06.179 --> 03:02:43.490 align:start position:0%
Eric I don't think that's what he was
saying

03:02:43.490 --> 03:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:43.500 --> 03:02:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:02:46.969 --> 03:02:46.979 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open up the public
 
03:02:46.979 --> 03:02:48.650 align:start position:0%
all right we'll open up the public
hearing

03:02:48.650 --> 03:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:02:48.660 --> 03:02:50.929 align:start position:0%
hearing
on

03:02:50.929 --> 03:02:50.939 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 86 relative to probing the
 
03:02:55.250 --> 03:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
state from Contracting the Chinese
 
03:02:57.230 --> 03:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
government-owned Affiliated technology
 
03:02:57.240 --> 03:03:01.610 align:start position:0%
government-owned Affiliated technology
manufacturers

03:03:01.610 --> 03:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:05.929 --> 03:03:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:08.630 --> 03:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative Roy down in he was just
 
03:03:10.429 --> 03:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
settling in for lunch downstairs wasn't
 
03:03:10.439 --> 03:03:11.809 align:start position:0%
settling in for lunch downstairs wasn't
he

03:03:11.809 --> 03:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
he
 
03:03:11.819 --> 03:03:15.670 align:start position:0%
he
um

03:03:15.670 --> 03:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:18.769 --> 03:03:18.779 align:start position:0%
how could he even miss this
 
03:03:18.779 --> 03:03:27.910 align:start position:0%
how could he even miss this
America

03:03:27.910 --> 03:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know you don't think you should you
 
03:03:33.050 --> 03:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
know you get it 24 hours of life before
 
03:03:34.730 --> 03:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
we kill it
 
03:03:36.290 --> 03:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
I could have sworn I just saw him
 
03:03:36.300 --> 03:07:57.410 align:start position:0%
I could have sworn I just saw him
downstairs

03:07:57.410 --> 03:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:59.150 --> 03:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
you can go ahead and tell us why you're
 
03:08:01.370 --> 03:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
opposed to it all right thank you
 
03:08:03.650 --> 03:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
um all right good afternoon Mr chair
 
03:08:05.150 --> 03:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:08:07.070 --> 03:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
Dennis Goulet I'm the commissioner for
 
03:08:09.410 --> 03:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
the Department of Information Technology
 
03:08:11.450 --> 03:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here it's it's odd to be
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition to this uh but
 
03:08:17.330 --> 03:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
I think you'll understand once I lay the
 
03:08:19.370 --> 03:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
details down for you um I I really do
 
03:08:22.370 --> 03:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
applaud the sponsor for for um you know
 
03:08:24.410 --> 03:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
paying attention to our you know what's
 
03:08:25.969 --> 03:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
going on in the world with respect to
 
03:08:27.170 --> 03:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
our you know
 
03:08:29.690 --> 03:08:29.700 align:start position:0%
some of our friends and and some not
 
03:08:33.050 --> 03:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
friends who are who are using technology
 
03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
um in in ways that aren't in our best
 
03:08:37.969 --> 03:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
interest as a country but um but there's
 
03:08:40.550 --> 03:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
I I think there may be another approach
 
03:08:42.769 --> 03:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
that we can use that that might be more
 
03:08:44.929 --> 03:08:44.939 align:start position:0%
effective and and wouldn't require
 
03:08:48.170 --> 03:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
legislation at this time
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things about this if
 
03:08:51.950 --> 03:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
you read the language it's very focused
 
03:08:55.550 --> 03:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
on China we have other countries who are
 
03:08:58.010 --> 03:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
who are using technology in ways that
 
03:09:00.410 --> 03:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
aren't in our uh in our best interests
 
03:09:02.750 --> 03:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
either so um you know we look we would
 
03:09:04.490 --> 03:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
look to
 
03:09:06.110 --> 03:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
um anything that we wanted to put in
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
place we would want to be able to Target
 
03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:10.190 align:start position:0%
place we would want to be able to Target
um

03:09:10.190 --> 03:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:13.010 --> 03:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
any other entity who is using technology
 
03:09:15.050 --> 03:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
in a way that that we felt was not in
 
03:09:16.490 --> 03:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
the interest of our state or our
 
03:09:16.500 --> 03:09:17.990 align:start position:0%
the interest of our state or our
citizens

03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
03:09:19.790 --> 03:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
um you know for example uh already in
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
statute there's a Kaspersky software
 
03:09:25.910 --> 03:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
which is a lot we believe is somewhat
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
aligned with the Russian government is
 
03:09:29.929 --> 03:09:29.939 align:start position:0%
is not allowed in state government for
 
03:09:31.370 --> 03:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
example today it's a very specific
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
legislation on that
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
um we also believe that the
 
03:09:40.429 --> 03:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
um that there's an approach that we've
 
03:09:42.410 --> 03:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
done some research on what's going on
 
03:09:44.450 --> 03:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
with in the federal government and other
 
03:09:47.090 --> 03:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
states and the approach rather than kind
 
03:09:49.490 --> 03:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
of saying this type of company we will
 
03:09:51.469 --> 03:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
not allow to contract with or do
 
03:09:53.870 --> 03:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
business with we'd like to maintain a
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
specific list
 
03:09:58.010 --> 03:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
and I'll get into that more in a minute
 
03:10:02.050 --> 03:10:02.060 align:start position:0%
um and and have that list be dynamic
 
03:10:06.170 --> 03:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
so that for example um you know if you
 
03:10:08.269 --> 03:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
if you've um ever bought something on
 
03:10:11.389 --> 03:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
Amazon you you may notice that you buy
 
03:10:13.790 --> 03:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
some thing maybe it's a small electronic
 
03:10:15.530 --> 03:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
device or whatever and you know eight
 
03:10:16.670 --> 03:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
months later if you want another one
 
03:10:17.929 --> 03:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
that company doesn't seem to exist
 
03:10:19.490 --> 03:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
anymore well that's a fairly common
 
03:10:21.170 --> 03:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
thing that the Chinese government's
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
doing so having a dynamic list of who
 
03:10:25.849 --> 03:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
whose which companies are prescribed
 
03:10:29.870 --> 03:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
we're seeing as trending toward a best
 
03:10:32.570 --> 03:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
practice in cyber security
 
03:10:35.450 --> 03:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
um so um and then finally right now we
 
03:10:37.490 --> 03:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
don't need this because the the
 
03:10:39.170 --> 03:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
governor's executive order
 
03:10:39.180 --> 03:10:40.210 align:start position:0%
governor's executive order
um

03:10:40.210 --> 03:10:40.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:43.809 --> 03:10:43.819 align:start position:0%
202209 really does cover this presently
 
03:10:46.130 --> 03:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
and what we talked to the governor's
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
office about when we were working
 
03:10:49.790 --> 03:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
together with them on that executive
 
03:10:53.090 --> 03:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
order was that we put the order out and
 
03:10:54.710 --> 03:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
then we look for unintended consequences
 
03:10:57.170 --> 03:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
things we learn from it
 
03:10:57.180 --> 03:10:57.769 align:start position:0%
things we learn from it
um

03:10:57.769 --> 03:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
things that we might want to add or
 
03:11:03.170 --> 03:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
remove change and then seek legislation
 
03:11:05.809 --> 03:11:05.819 align:start position:0%
or get it in Statute in a future time
 
03:11:07.790 --> 03:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
like perhaps next session or whatever so
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then we would offer ourselves
 
03:11:14.809 --> 03:11:14.819 align:start position:0%
um to help write said legislation so
 
03:11:16.849 --> 03:11:16.859 align:start position:0%
that it so that it follows what we're
 
03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
seeing as best practice in the nation
 
03:11:19.740 --> 03:11:20.269 align:start position:0%
seeing as best practice in the nation
um

03:11:20.269 --> 03:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:22.610 --> 03:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
and in executive order right now we do
 
03:11:24.530 --> 03:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
have that Dynamic list of companies so
 
03:11:26.510 --> 03:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
there is a list there now
 
03:11:28.670 --> 03:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
but if we needed to change that list
 
03:11:30.650 --> 03:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
because you know the Chinese government
 
03:11:32.929 --> 03:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
had pivoted or the Soviets were the
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
Russians were doing something different
 
03:11:36.230 --> 03:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
we could actually pivot that list very
 
03:11:37.969 --> 03:11:37.979 align:start position:0%
quickly with the governor's approval in
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
legislation we could do that too we'd
 
03:11:41.210 --> 03:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
have we need a different mechanism but
 
03:11:43.370 --> 03:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
but I think that's really so I'm in
 
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
favor of this concept 100 the approach I
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
think we we may want to do a different
 
03:11:48.359 --> 03:11:49.550 align:start position:0%
think we we may want to do a different
approach

03:11:49.550 --> 03:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
approach
 
03:11:53.389 --> 03:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
any questions from the Committee Member
 
03:11:59.809 --> 03:11:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:03.230 --> 03:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I looked at the list of
 
03:12:06.410 --> 03:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
components and companies and all kinds
 
03:12:07.550 --> 03:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
of things that the federal government
 
03:12:10.250 --> 03:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
and the FCC have already put on their
 
03:12:12.769 --> 03:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
list of do not touch
 
03:12:15.650 --> 03:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
uh and are you saying that that list
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
isn't comprehensive enough
 
03:12:20.330 --> 03:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh well that that is the that's uh
 
03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's a subset of the list that we put
 
03:12:24.110 --> 03:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
in the governor's executive order so
 
03:12:26.030 --> 03:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's I think we added a couple other
 
03:12:28.010 --> 03:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
things in there as well and it depends
 
03:12:29.210 --> 03:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
on you know the federal government
 
03:12:31.130 --> 03:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
actually has multiple lists
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
too so this is I'd call what what we had
 
03:12:36.650 --> 03:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
in the executive order a superset of
 
03:12:38.690 --> 03:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
what we were aware of at that moment and
 
03:12:40.450 --> 03:12:40.460 align:start position:0%
if we become aware of other things other
 
03:12:42.889 --> 03:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
uh technologies that we feel the state
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be using we would uh amend the
 
03:12:45.359 --> 03:12:48.650 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be using we would uh amend the
list

03:12:48.650 --> 03:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:53.389 --> 03:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:55.309 --> 03:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
03:12:55.319 --> 03:12:56.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
testimony

03:12:56.750 --> 03:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm just looking at the executive
 
03:12:59.750 --> 03:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
order that you referenced
 
03:13:03.170 --> 03:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
uh you're you're directed to remove
 
03:13:05.389 --> 03:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
software and Hardware
 
03:13:08.929 --> 03:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
uh from the state's Networks
 
03:13:10.490 --> 03:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
um could you just give us maybe an
 
03:13:13.730 --> 03:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
update on what you found in your Audits
 
03:13:16.370 --> 03:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
and what you've had to do to transition
 
03:13:17.889 --> 03:13:17.899 align:start position:0%
away from
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
away from uh technology that might give
 
03:13:23.750 --> 03:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
the Communist Party of China information
 
03:13:25.969 --> 03:13:25.979 align:start position:0%
about the state of New Hampshire right
 
03:13:28.190 --> 03:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
well the good news is we've been pretty
 
03:13:31.070 --> 03:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
Vigilant even without executive order or
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
legislation we've been Vigilant and
 
03:13:35.330 --> 03:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
trying not to use this technology so it
 
03:13:36.889 --> 03:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
really didn't the executive order didn't
 
03:13:38.690 --> 03:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
cause us much trouble where we where we
 
03:13:40.190 --> 03:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
had a bit of a challenge is how do we
 
03:13:43.010 --> 03:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
assure that we're not loading tick tock
 
03:13:46.849 --> 03:13:46.859 align:start position:0%
tick tock I almost said Tic Tac onto uh
 
03:13:49.490 --> 03:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
onto State devices like we we know that
 
03:13:51.230 --> 03:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
for example on the our computers we
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
control them very closely but the mobile
 
03:13:54.290 --> 03:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
devices we didn't have as close a
 
03:13:56.330 --> 03:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
control on so we actually acquired some
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
technology from a company we were
 
03:14:00.050 --> 03:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
already doing business with who's not
 
03:14:03.710 --> 03:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
Chinese and um and we're now managing
 
03:14:05.630 --> 03:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
the or we're in the process of
 
03:14:07.429 --> 03:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
implementing that and we'll be managing
 
03:14:09.469 --> 03:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
the state mobile devices as well so that
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing tick tock on those
 
03:14:13.010 --> 03:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
devices the other challenge is there's
 
03:14:16.370 --> 03:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
some legitimate State business that
 
03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
occurs on Tic Tac might Tick Tock it
 
03:14:20.630 --> 03:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
might be investigations or whatever so
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
we had to figure out a way to do that
 
03:14:24.469 --> 03:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
and still in compliance with the
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
executive order so um you know basically
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
not connecting those devices to the
 
03:14:31.870 --> 03:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:34.130 --> 03:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
representative Terry thank you
 
03:14:38.450 --> 03:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
so do I understand that you um have uh a
 
03:14:41.929 --> 03:14:41.939 align:start position:0%
screening process uh with a set of
 
03:14:44.570 --> 03:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
parameters or or criteria in place to be
 
03:14:47.330 --> 03:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
able to vet any
 
03:14:51.370 --> 03:14:51.380 align:start position:0%
um existing and potential uh uh new
 
03:14:55.190 --> 03:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
purchases of software Hardware so that
 
03:14:57.530 --> 03:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
it doesn't become a discovery later on
 
03:15:00.309 --> 03:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
because there wasn't a process in place
 
03:15:03.230 --> 03:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
to to preempt this sort of thing from
 
03:15:04.969 --> 03:15:04.979 align:start position:0%
happening correct
 
03:15:07.969 --> 03:15:07.979 align:start position:0%
um one of the one of the steps the
 
03:15:09.490 --> 03:15:09.500 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
03:15:11.990 --> 03:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
I.T has pretty broad Authority on
 
03:15:14.269 --> 03:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
contracts and all of the contracts come
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
before me
 
03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
um before they move forward to go to a
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and the other
 
03:15:22.790 --> 03:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
entities that would review them inside
 
03:15:25.370 --> 03:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
of my process our chief information
 
03:15:28.429 --> 03:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
security officer and other technology
 
03:15:30.769 --> 03:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
directors review each contract and we
 
03:15:32.750 --> 03:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
would go back to the agency and say you
 
03:15:34.969 --> 03:15:34.979 align:start position:0%
know if we found an issue with whether
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
whether it was the company or the um or
 
03:15:40.610 --> 03:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
the um the terms of the contract they
 
03:15:42.290 --> 03:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
felt might not be safe from a security
 
03:15:44.510 --> 03:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
or privacy perspective so we have we
 
03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
have eyes on it and typically what we
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
advise in and we try to do this with the
 
03:15:51.490 --> 03:15:51.500 align:start position:0%
agencies because we do have I.T presence
 
03:15:54.790 --> 03:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
in almost all the agencies
 
03:15:57.650 --> 03:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
we try to do that process in stream
 
03:16:00.050 --> 03:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
versus it coming to me at the end and
 
03:16:01.849 --> 03:16:01.859 align:start position:0%
then we have a problem with it rather we
 
03:16:03.710 --> 03:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
would try to find oh you know we
 
03:16:06.050 --> 03:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be for example some of the
 
03:16:08.269 --> 03:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
companies on this list on the executive
 
03:16:10.730 --> 03:16:10.740 align:start position:0%
order always come in as low bidders
 
03:16:15.650 --> 03:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
always not an accident and so
 
03:16:17.809 --> 03:16:17.819 align:start position:0%
um and so States actually have some of
 
03:16:19.490 --> 03:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
this technology in place and now they're
 
03:16:21.230 --> 03:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
like holy smokes I have to replace all
 
03:16:23.809 --> 03:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
this really expensive stuff we we don't
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
just you know for technology purchases
 
03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
we don't just go with low bidder we go
 
03:16:30.050 --> 03:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
with what makes sense so we wouldn't put
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
a a Huawei solution in or a solution
 
03:16:35.690 --> 03:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
that contained knowingly contained the
 
03:16:39.650 --> 03:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:44.450 --> 03:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:46.849 --> 03:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
thank you I just have another question
 
03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't I'm not uh I'm not an expert
 
03:16:52.370 --> 03:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
in this by any means so I'm just asking
 
03:16:56.389 --> 03:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
based on news reports that I've heard
 
03:16:59.030 --> 03:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the 5G technology that's been rolled
 
03:17:02.690 --> 03:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
out uh some of that is or can be based
 
03:17:02.700 --> 03:17:03.290 align:start position:0%
out uh some of that is or can be based
on

03:17:03.290 --> 03:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:17:06.050 --> 03:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
Chinese Hardware manufacturers Just in
 
03:17:09.410 --> 03:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
our uh the the cellular networks that we
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
all use is that a fair statement yes and
 
03:17:16.370 --> 03:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
so yeah so that the um and you're
 
03:17:18.349 --> 03:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
bringing up a pretty large issue that
 
03:17:19.790 --> 03:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see more and more in
 
03:17:22.010 --> 03:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
society is what we call a supply chain
 
03:17:24.590 --> 03:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
issue right you're paying attention not
 
03:17:26.030 --> 03:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
just to where the end product is
 
03:17:28.490 --> 03:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
purchased from but where the components
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
come from and whether there's stuff
 
03:17:34.370 --> 03:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
embedded in that and it's I wouldn't say
 
03:17:36.889 --> 03:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
that it's it's limited to 5G technology
 
03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
either I would say the 4G LTE and other
 
03:17:42.349 --> 03:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
Technologies potentially in the
 
03:17:44.150 --> 03:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
commercial sector could potentially have
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
that issue as well and and that's one of
 
03:17:47.450 --> 03:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
the reasons why the Department of
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
Defense really got strict on their um
 
03:17:51.769 --> 03:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
you know their procurements and and
 
03:17:53.870 --> 03:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
where we got a lot of this list from was
 
03:17:56.450 --> 03:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
DOD they did they actually had the
 
03:17:58.130 --> 03:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
resources to do the research which we
 
03:18:00.830 --> 03:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
didn't follow further question and so
 
03:18:03.769 --> 03:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
the cellular networks that we all use as
 
03:18:05.870 --> 03:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
we travel around the state
 
03:18:05.880 --> 03:18:06.830 align:start position:0%
we travel around the state
um

03:18:06.830 --> 03:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:08.090 --> 03:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to this question
 
03:18:10.490 --> 03:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
have you looked into seeing
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh if any of that Hardware is it would
 
03:18:16.190 --> 03:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
violate this list because I think the
 
03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
devices that the state uses would also
 
03:18:21.230 --> 03:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
connect to those networks is that
 
03:18:22.490 --> 03:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
is that something that you've looked
 
03:18:25.490 --> 03:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
into we have not done that it it it
 
03:18:28.969 --> 03:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
actually is um that would be a fairly
 
03:18:31.610 --> 03:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
large undertaking and and um where it
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
goes beyond my uh my charge in in 21r
 
03:18:37.610 --> 03:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
but um the I think it would depend on
 
03:18:39.170 --> 03:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
the vendors and and I'm sure that
 
03:18:41.570 --> 03:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
they're all looking at that now
 
03:18:41.580 --> 03:18:42.349 align:start position:0%
they're all looking at that now
um

03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:44.929 --> 03:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
so I I couldn't get go further than that
 
03:18:46.610 --> 03:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
I haven't spent time on that particular
 
03:18:46.620 --> 03:18:50.030 align:start position:0%
I haven't spent time on that particular
issue

03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not so sure if I'm allowed
 
03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:55.130 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not so sure if I'm allowed
to

03:18:55.130 --> 03:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:18:57.349 --> 03:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
say this
 
03:19:02.450 --> 03:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
I looked at the FCC website and they are
 
03:19:07.610 --> 03:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
definitely squashing it
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
anything that's coming from China to
 
03:19:12.410 --> 03:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
deal with 5G that has any kind of
 
03:19:14.269 --> 03:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
criteria that they're worried about
 
03:19:16.490 --> 03:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
sending data back or whatever they've
 
03:19:19.490 --> 03:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
stopped it and the FCC specifically
 
03:19:22.130 --> 03:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:23.929 --> 03:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
you have to ask him yeah I think the
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
question would be has already there been
 
03:19:32.450 --> 03:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
some right that made its way into is it
 
03:19:34.969 --> 03:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
isn't it true yes
 
03:19:38.269 --> 03:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you all right thank you
 
03:19:38.279 --> 03:19:39.590 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you all right thank you
okay

03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:40.730 align:start position:0%
okay
nice

03:19:40.730 --> 03:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
nice
 
03:19:43.309 --> 03:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
you see the this is right here sponsor
 
03:19:45.530 --> 03:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
arrive yes
 
03:19:55.269 --> 03:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.769 --> 03:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Terry Roy I
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 31 uh the towns of
 
03:20:05.030 --> 03:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
Deerfield Candia Chester and Auburn and
 
03:20:06.769 --> 03:20:06.779 align:start position:0%
um I understand you've heard some
 
03:20:08.269 --> 03:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill already from the
 
03:20:09.710 --> 03:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
state I picked up a little bit at the
 
03:20:12.290 --> 03:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
end of it there and I'm I'm very pleased
 
03:20:14.690 --> 03:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
to see that they seem to be um beginning
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
to take a look at this
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
um having said that I heard executive
 
03:20:21.889 --> 03:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
branch I didn't hear anything about the
 
03:20:23.530 --> 03:20:23.540 align:start position:0%
judicial branch or any of the other
 
03:20:27.230 --> 03:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
parts of government including our own
 
03:20:29.330 --> 03:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
if the committee's decision is to say
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
let them handle it I would ask you to
 
03:20:32.809 --> 03:20:32.819 align:start position:0%
make sure that you look into the fact
 
03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
that this is this is pervasive across
 
03:20:38.769 --> 03:20:38.779 align:start position:0%
all branches of government
 
03:20:38.779 --> 03:20:40.370 align:start position:0%
all branches of government
and

03:20:40.370 --> 03:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:20:42.410 --> 03:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
this puts some teeth in it I didn't hear
 
03:20:43.790 --> 03:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
anything about a penalty if a company
 
03:20:45.469 --> 03:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
comes in and tries to bid to another
 
03:20:47.570 --> 03:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
company into another company through a
 
03:20:48.830 --> 03:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
shell game
 
03:20:52.610 --> 03:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
and if they get caught as far as I heard
 
03:20:54.410 --> 03:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
they're they're banned if they if they
 
03:20:57.469 --> 03:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
get caught but this adds teeth to the a
 
03:20:59.570 --> 03:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
company a U.S company that tries to
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
front for uh the Chinese government and
 
03:21:04.490 --> 03:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
that has been happening in the states as
 
03:21:04.500 --> 03:21:05.630 align:start position:0%
that has been happening in the states as
well

03:21:05.630 --> 03:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:21:07.790 --> 03:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
um it's it's everywhere it's very
 
03:21:10.010 --> 03:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
difficult to track and keep up with in
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
real time
 
03:21:13.730 --> 03:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
um so we're always playing catch-up I
 
03:21:16.070 --> 03:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
feel like this bill would put some teeth
 
03:21:18.290 --> 03:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
in it from the front and make companies
 
03:21:20.210 --> 03:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
think twice about doing business with
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Chinese company and then proffering
 
03:21:23.809 --> 03:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
themselves as a supplier to the state of
 
03:21:26.990 --> 03:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or any of its branches
 
03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:27.769 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or any of its branches
um

03:21:27.769 --> 03:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:30.230 --> 03:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
having said that I'm open to any
 
03:21:31.370 --> 03:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
questions I think you've heard the
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
technical aspects and I don't want to
 
03:21:34.490 --> 03:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
have to repeat what was already
 
03:21:35.929 --> 03:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
testified to
 
03:21:38.269 --> 03:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so what we heard was that the the
 
03:21:40.010 --> 03:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
governor has an order
 
03:21:42.170 --> 03:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
and does affect all elements of
 
03:21:42.180 --> 03:21:43.309 align:start position:0%
and does affect all elements of
government

03:21:43.309 --> 03:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:21:44.929 --> 03:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
in just judicial branch as well
 
03:21:47.929 --> 03:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
everybody I mean theoretically it's it's
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh across all across
 
03:21:55.309 --> 03:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
executive branch executive branch okay
 
03:21:57.410 --> 03:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
um and it's Dynamic and sense that it
 
03:21:59.950 --> 03:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
can be rolling so things can come and go
 
03:22:02.570 --> 03:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
and it's part of reaching
 
03:22:05.750 --> 03:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's what we've heard so far so it
 
03:22:07.309 --> 03:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
does just cover the executive branch or
 
03:22:09.710 --> 03:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
all branches all all of the executive
 
03:22:11.809 --> 03:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
branch okay so that still leaves the
 
03:22:14.210 --> 03:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and the legislature or
 
03:22:17.090 --> 03:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
other branches that are open to um to
 
03:22:19.370 --> 03:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
purchasing this type of stuff so I would
 
03:22:21.469 --> 03:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
only ask that if if
 
03:22:24.230 --> 03:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
there's still questions that you at
 
03:22:26.150 --> 03:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
least retain it and take a look to make
 
03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
sure that there's a comprehensive plan
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
and we just don't throw it away and say
 
03:22:31.969 --> 03:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
well the governor's on this
 
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
um right well we'll do our homework on
 
03:22:35.510 --> 03:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
that but I would I would say at the end
 
03:22:37.370 --> 03:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
of the day everything that's being
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
purchased has to go through executive
 
03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:41.630 align:start position:0%
purchased has to go through executive
Council

03:22:41.630 --> 03:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:41.640 --> 03:22:53.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:22:53.389 --> 03:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:53.399 --> 03:22:54.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:22:54.050 --> 03:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:57.170 --> 03:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah so we will make sure that
 
03:22:59.630 --> 03:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
this that Governor's order is effective
 
03:22:59.640 --> 03:23:01.490 align:start position:0%
this that Governor's order is effective
everywhere

03:23:01.490 --> 03:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
03:23:03.830 --> 03:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
any questions for me
 
03:23:06.410 --> 03:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
we do represent them below we just have
 
03:23:07.790 --> 03:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
a question about
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
um just drafting this bill did you
 
03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
consult with the Department of I.T
 
03:23:15.950 --> 03:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
The Who Department of I.T yeah
 
03:23:19.490 --> 03:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
um no I did not um they um this bill
 
03:23:21.290 --> 03:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
came out before I drafted this before
 
03:23:23.269 --> 03:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
they came out with that executive order
 
03:23:23.279 --> 03:23:25.490 align:start position:0%
they came out with that executive order
okay

03:23:25.490 --> 03:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:23:28.190 --> 03:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and
 
03:23:31.250 --> 03:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you
 
03:23:32.750 --> 03:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
um isn't there something like this on a
 
03:23:35.150 --> 03:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
03:23:37.729 --> 03:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
there there is and there isn't um they
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
it they put something out on a federal
 
03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:40.910 align:start position:0%
it they put something out on a federal
level

03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
um that wasn't broad or and it only
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
handled that they can't mandate what
 
03:23:48.349 --> 03:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
states do so they can't tell States you
 
03:23:50.750 --> 03:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
won't do business with this company so
 
03:23:52.070 --> 03:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
technically it's not illegal to do
 
03:23:54.170 --> 03:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
business with a Chinese company they
 
03:23:56.809 --> 03:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
advise you you probably shouldn't
 
03:23:58.550 --> 03:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
um so they on the federal level they say
 
03:24:00.110 --> 03:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
we're not going to but the states are
 
03:24:01.729 --> 03:24:01.739 align:start position:0%
kind of on their own in a kind of wild
 
03:24:04.429 --> 03:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
west thing so the model legislation came
 
03:24:06.229 --> 03:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
from the association of state
 
03:24:08.269 --> 03:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
governments so they are recommending
 
03:24:10.250 --> 03:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
that the member states actually take
 
03:24:12.290 --> 03:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
action on their own at this point just
 
03:24:14.510 --> 03:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're not being left
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
03:24:18.530 --> 03:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you
 
03:24:20.269 --> 03:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:24:22.250 --> 03:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you thank you
 
03:24:24.969 --> 03:24:24.979 align:start position:0%
get back to your committee
 
03:24:29.630 --> 03:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh chair will call on Lily Tang Williams
 
03:24:45.410 --> 03:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:47.389 --> 03:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:24:49.849 --> 03:24:49.859 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you actually I come here to
 
03:24:52.010 --> 03:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
support other two bills but I heard
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
about this bill I look at the bill very
 
03:24:57.290 --> 03:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
quickly and I will show my support for
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
this bill because I have a special
 
03:25:02.570 --> 03:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
background I was born in communist China
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
I lived there for 24 years under the
 
03:25:09.469 --> 03:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
iron Fest of China's Communist party and
 
03:25:12.590 --> 03:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
I went to law school and my business
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
right now one of the home business I
 
03:25:17.769 --> 03:25:17.779 align:start position:0%
have is actually the
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
expert witness I can go to court to
 
03:25:24.349 --> 03:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
testify based on my personal background
 
03:25:27.889 --> 03:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
experience life in China and on anything
 
03:25:30.349 --> 03:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
related to Chinese business government
 
03:25:34.250 --> 03:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
and the practices so this bill
 
03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
is good because I know that some other
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
people might not know especially
 
03:25:43.790 --> 03:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
business community that the Communist
 
03:25:46.969 --> 03:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
Party of China is very clever very
 
03:25:51.110 --> 03:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
shrewd to package their companies and
 
03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
also their messages to the world to be
 
03:25:57.950 --> 03:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
friendly to China and to think China is
 
03:26:01.130 --> 03:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
somehow free market a little bit
 
03:26:03.290 --> 03:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
framework economy
 
03:26:06.910 --> 03:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
but I would just want to share with you
 
03:26:11.330 --> 03:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
China's economy is totally
 
03:26:13.370 --> 03:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
one-party control
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
some companies are registered as private
 
03:26:16.560 --> 03:26:18.170 align:start position:0%
some companies are registered as private
companies

03:26:18.170 --> 03:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
companies
 
03:26:21.650 --> 03:26:21.660 align:start position:0%
but under the China's national security
 
03:26:24.889 --> 03:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
law that applies to Hong Kong also that
 
03:26:27.650 --> 03:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
means that anything they want from a
 
03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
private company
 
03:26:31.070 --> 03:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
they got to have it
 
03:26:33.950 --> 03:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
and lots of former China's officials
 
03:26:35.870 --> 03:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
inside the party
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
they go to sit on the board and become
 
03:26:42.050 --> 03:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
owners of those so-called China private
 
03:26:44.290 --> 03:26:44.300 align:start position:0%
companies you know what happened to
 
03:26:47.210 --> 03:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
Alibaba if you are truly private company
 
03:26:50.210 --> 03:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
dare to criticize a party they're going
 
03:26:52.429 --> 03:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
to force you out
 
03:26:54.410 --> 03:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
you know leave your company you funded
 
03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
and going hide out overseas
 
03:27:00.170 --> 03:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
and I know lots of self-employed Chinese
 
03:27:02.990 --> 03:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
small business owners
 
03:27:05.090 --> 03:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
I feel sympathetic toward them when
 
03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do business under the
 
03:27:09.050 --> 03:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
one party rule
 
03:27:11.929 --> 03:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
but they have to comply with all their
 
03:27:14.570 --> 03:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
National Security laws whatever data
 
03:27:17.170 --> 03:27:17.180 align:start position:0%
they want whatever technology they want
 
03:27:20.809 --> 03:27:20.819 align:start position:0%
or in the name of National Security you
 
03:27:23.330 --> 03:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
gotta comply or you lose license to
 
03:27:23.340 --> 03:27:24.530 align:start position:0%
gotta comply or you lose license to
exist

03:27:24.530 --> 03:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
exist
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
and I have friends who come to this
 
03:27:28.729 --> 03:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
country as a political Refuge because
 
03:27:32.090 --> 03:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
the local government trying to
 
03:27:34.130 --> 03:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
steal their money destroy their
 
03:27:37.070 --> 03:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
companies and they had to grab whatever
 
03:27:40.250 --> 03:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
they have left and run into this country
 
03:27:40.260 --> 03:27:41.330 align:start position:0%
they have left and run into this country
so

03:27:41.330 --> 03:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:43.990 --> 03:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
and even where I come to New Hampshire
 
03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
in 2019 I have been American citizen
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
since 1995.
 
03:27:50.040 --> 03:27:51.889 align:start position:0%
since 1995.
and

03:27:51.889 --> 03:27:51.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:56.090 --> 03:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
because I speak up here against CCP I
 
03:27:59.450 --> 03:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
was a threatened put on Blacklist cannot
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
go home to visit my family and friends
 
03:28:04.130 --> 03:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
in China since 2019.
 
03:28:06.290 --> 03:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
the recently discovered me is by some
 
03:28:08.750 --> 03:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
social media posts on Facebook talk
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
about how much I love America I come
 
03:28:13.550 --> 03:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
here with nothing I'm living American
 
03:28:16.429 --> 03:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
Dream it's not even political but they
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
come to my social media thread me and my
 
03:28:23.929 --> 03:28:23.939 align:start position:0%
family to say if you go back to China
 
03:28:26.690 --> 03:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
oh you better not your wanted criminals
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
by telling the truth
 
03:28:31.610 --> 03:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
but I feel it's my American Citizen's
 
03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
duty to tell the truth to educate the
 
03:28:37.790 --> 03:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
public for who they are what the true
 
03:28:41.269 --> 03:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
color of China's Communist party and
 
03:28:43.370 --> 03:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
what they portray to the world to the
 
03:28:45.229 --> 03:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
Western countries
 
03:28:47.330 --> 03:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
lots of them are lies
 
03:28:49.429 --> 03:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
and they even hire social media
 
03:28:52.849 --> 03:28:52.859 align:start position:0%
influencers to tell their lies they
 
03:28:54.650 --> 03:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
think American people are naive about
 
03:28:56.990 --> 03:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
China they romance in the Middle Kingdom
 
03:29:00.170 --> 03:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
and just what they did for past 40 years
 
03:29:02.809 --> 03:29:02.819 align:start position:0%
when China started opened up I support
 
03:29:05.030 --> 03:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
the economical open up I support the
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
decentralization of the economy but
 
03:29:11.290 --> 03:29:11.300 align:start position:0%
China today is going backward under the
 
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
dictatorship of Xi Jinping he is a
 
03:29:14.760 --> 03:29:15.889 align:start position:0%
dictatorship of Xi Jinping he is a
maoist

03:29:15.889 --> 03:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
maoist
 
03:29:19.550 --> 03:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
and he wants to tell the world we are
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
going to be number one by 2049 he's a
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
China drawing it's not Chinese people's
 
03:29:28.070 --> 03:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
dream Chinese people are their biggest
 
03:29:33.290 --> 03:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
with victims of their regime ruthless my
 
03:29:35.210 --> 03:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
friends who in the law school with me in
 
03:29:36.769 --> 03:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
Shanghai were locked down their homes
 
03:29:40.729 --> 03:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
for 10 weeks starving could not go out
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
of their apartment doors were welded by
 
03:29:45.650 --> 03:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
the iron bars
 
03:29:48.349 --> 03:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
and that's why we had students going out
 
03:29:50.590 --> 03:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
people going out for the white paper
 
03:29:54.110 --> 03:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
protest silence they protest why they
 
03:29:56.510 --> 03:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
hold a piece of white paper and smaller
 
03:29:59.809 --> 03:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
than this one because they say we have
 
03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
not to say but we cannot see it because
 
03:30:04.790 --> 03:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
we will get locked up so we just stand
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
up there hold piece of paper quietly
 
03:30:11.210 --> 03:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
protest because they thought there's a
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
zero Kobe lockdown is going to make them
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
and not to be dead anyway they might
 
03:30:18.110 --> 03:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
just protest so now they just got rid of
 
03:30:20.330 --> 03:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
that which is good right right but then
 
03:30:22.429 --> 03:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
the collapse of medicine the health care
 
03:30:24.530 --> 03:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
so people are dying and they don't even
 
03:30:25.729 --> 03:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
tell the world
 
03:30:27.889 --> 03:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
how many people are infected how many
 
03:30:29.630 --> 03:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
people died
 
03:30:33.229 --> 03:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
and their numbers are totally lying
 
03:30:37.309 --> 03:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
so I would support our state
 
03:30:40.370 --> 03:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
build like this and we have to be very
 
03:30:43.490 --> 03:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
careful whenever we deal with anybody
 
03:30:46.490 --> 03:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
related to a Chinese government for
 
03:30:49.130 --> 03:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
example Confucius Institute was in state
 
03:30:52.370 --> 03:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire on campus of unh for so
 
03:30:54.830 --> 03:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
many years founded by Chinese government
 
03:30:57.769 --> 03:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
funded by the state Council under the
 
03:31:01.010 --> 03:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
Han ban Chinese language Department
 
03:31:03.889 --> 03:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
they were here send the teachers send
 
03:31:06.530 --> 03:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
the money here to make China look good
 
03:31:08.929 --> 03:31:08.939 align:start position:0%
they did teach language it did teach
 
03:31:11.809 --> 03:31:11.819 align:start position:0%
culture which are all wonderful part but
 
03:31:13.610 --> 03:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
what else they teach or they're not
 
03:31:15.290 --> 03:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
allowed to teach not allowed to answer
 
03:31:17.870 --> 03:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
student questions Honestly by their
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
teachers you don't know
 
03:31:22.130 --> 03:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying they are very
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
very short we cannot be like if I'm in
 
03:31:29.330 --> 03:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now and whenever you deal
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%

um you're representing yourself you say
 
03:32:30.769 --> 03:32:30.779 align:start position:0%

03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
a business now yes and uh I'm a very
 
03:32:35.150 --> 03:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
blessed in this country I come here with
 
03:32:38.269 --> 03:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
nothing 100 in my pocket could not speak
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
English and the first day I met my
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
husband in Austin Texas going to
 
03:32:46.010 --> 03:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
graduate school there and
 
03:32:48.290 --> 03:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
get married raise three wonderful
 
03:32:50.809 --> 03:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
children and work will work until I got
 
03:32:53.570 --> 03:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
layoff year of 2000 I said hey here's my
 
03:32:55.849 --> 03:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to start my own business so
 
03:32:58.010 --> 03:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
because I have low degree in China and
 
03:33:00.889 --> 03:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
the truly bilingual now I hope and so I
 
03:33:03.710 --> 03:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
started my business to do Consulting and
 
03:33:06.650 --> 03:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
to um but that was not profitable for
 
03:33:07.969 --> 03:33:07.979 align:start position:0%
eight years and later we got into
 
03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
residential real estate so now my
 
03:33:12.290 --> 03:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
husband took early retirement we managed
 
03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
our rental properties I'm also
 
03:33:16.490 --> 03:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
professional speaker and and expert
 
03:33:19.250 --> 03:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
witness I can go to work on either a
 
03:33:22.190 --> 03:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting side or defense side and go
 
03:33:25.550 --> 03:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
to court to testify and so I have three
 
03:33:28.370 --> 03:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
home business I have flexibility and for
 
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
the most time I'm really focused on you
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
know like how I can educate people about
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
China because I don't want this country
 
03:33:38.330 --> 03:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
become like China but if the China
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
becomes number one
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
powerful country in the world like Xi
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
Jinping by 2049 I'm really worried about
 
03:33:49.729 --> 03:33:49.739 align:start position:0%
my three children's Futures like I live
 
03:33:51.769 --> 03:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
under their iron fist I don't want
 
03:33:54.469 --> 03:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
anybody ever live under their hair fast
 
03:33:56.510 --> 03:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
so that's my straight home business I
 
03:34:00.349 --> 03:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:03.000 align:start position:0%

03:34:20.700 --> 03:34:33.070 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:34:33.070 --> 03:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:38.330 --> 03:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:42.889 --> 03:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
okay sorry close the hearing anything oh
 
03:34:45.290 --> 03:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I wasn't paying attention
 
03:34:48.950 --> 03:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
03:34:54.889 --> 03:34:54.899 align:start position:0%

foreign

03:34:58.910 --> 03:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:01.490 --> 03:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman hunt members of
 
03:35:03.290 --> 03:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:35:07.510 --> 03:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
I am here to introduce House Bill 225
 
03:35:11.210 --> 03:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
which is my bill about currency
 
03:35:13.790 --> 03:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
and it says privacy rights but it's
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
actually a bit broader than that it
 
03:35:16.610 --> 03:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
speaks generally to the rights of
 
03:35:19.309 --> 03:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
Americans and New Hampshire citizens
 
03:35:19.319 --> 03:35:20.750 align:start position:0%
Americans and New Hampshire citizens
now

03:35:20.750 --> 03:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:35:22.910 --> 03:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
you will
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar if you've been
 
03:35:25.729 --> 03:35:25.739 align:start position:0%
following the news and following current
 
03:35:27.290 --> 03:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
events you'll be familiar with the
 
03:35:29.090 --> 03:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
concept of a central bank digital
 
03:35:29.100 --> 03:35:30.349 align:start position:0%
concept of a central bank digital
currency

03:35:30.349 --> 03:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
currency
 
03:35:33.710 --> 03:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
now what this is is effectively
 
03:35:36.050 --> 03:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
a this is not the dollar not the dollar
 
03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
as we know it is not the same currency
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
it would be a whole new fresh currency
 
03:35:41.809 --> 03:35:41.819 align:start position:0%
that would be rolled out by the federal
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
government by the Federal Reserve
 
03:35:47.090 --> 03:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
that would have no physical presence it
 
03:35:49.729 --> 03:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
would be 100 digital and therefore be
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
programmed so it's essentially it's a
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
computer program
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
now there are ways to do this sort of
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
thing that are perfectly fine and then
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
there are ways to do this sort of thing
 
03:36:03.050 --> 03:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
that are very troubling some of the
 
03:36:04.250 --> 03:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
material I've passed around will
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrate uh how China has utilized
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
this exact same sort of Technology
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately what we've seen and
 
03:36:14.330 --> 03:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
what we've heard from some of the
 
03:36:16.910 --> 03:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
members of the Federal Reserve is that
 
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
they intend to pursue a Direction with
 
03:36:21.650 --> 03:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
their Central Bank digital currency that
 
03:36:24.590 --> 03:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
is more akin to China than for instance
 
03:36:24.600 --> 03:36:26.570 align:start position:0%
is more akin to China than for instance
Bitcoin

03:36:26.570 --> 03:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin
 
03:36:28.969 --> 03:36:28.979 align:start position:0%
um now I didn't specifically bring up
 
03:36:31.250 --> 03:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
and mention uh Central Bank digital
 
03:36:33.170 --> 03:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
currency in this bill for the very
 
03:36:35.809 --> 03:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
simple reason that I don't necessarily
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
have a problem with a central bank
 
03:36:40.490 --> 03:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
digital currency I have a problem with
 
03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
the elements of a currency that would be
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
detrimental to individual rights so
 
03:36:48.530 --> 03:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
let's talk about what some of those
 
03:36:49.969 --> 03:36:49.979 align:start position:0%
problems could be
 
03:36:52.490 --> 03:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh first of all we have privacy rights
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
right we don't necessarily want the
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
government knowing every time we buy a
 
03:36:57.710 --> 03:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
sandwich or go to the store to pick up
 
03:36:59.090 --> 03:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
feminine products or whatever we're
 
03:36:59.100 --> 03:37:00.229 align:start position:0%
feminine products or whatever we're
doing

03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:37:02.210 --> 03:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
the government does not need to know
 
03:37:04.309 --> 03:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
that but with the Central Bank digital
 
03:37:06.650 --> 03:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
currency there could be systems in place
 
03:37:09.349 --> 03:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
allowing such information to be real
 
03:37:11.870 --> 03:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
time available to the government or to
 
03:37:13.130 --> 03:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
their Partners such as the Federal
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
Reserve or the big Banks
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
they can also program this currency to
 
03:37:21.290 --> 03:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
prohibit certain types of transactions
 
03:37:23.450 --> 03:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
or to only be allowable for certain
 
03:37:25.250 --> 03:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
kinds of transactions
 
03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh for instance to go to China again
 
03:37:30.410 --> 03:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
they utilize this kind of technology and
 
03:37:32.090 --> 03:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
they it's they will attach it to a
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
social credit score
 
03:37:35.210 --> 03:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
and if you've said something not real
 
03:37:37.969 --> 03:37:37.979 align:start position:0%
nice about the government of China or if
 
03:37:39.170 --> 03:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
you've done something they don't like or
 
03:37:40.610 --> 03:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
didn't do something they would you like
 
03:37:42.769 --> 03:37:42.779 align:start position:0%
you to do they might just decide that
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
you don't get to buy lunch today or you
 
03:37:46.610 --> 03:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
don't get any money deposit into your
 
03:37:48.410 --> 03:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
account this week or you can't get on
 
03:37:51.769 --> 03:37:51.779 align:start position:0%
the bus to go to work or wherever this
 
03:37:53.330 --> 03:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
is the kind of power that can be
 
03:37:56.170 --> 03:37:56.180 align:start position:0%
achieved through a centralized
 
03:37:59.570 --> 03:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
digitalized program that is a central
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
bank digital currency
 
03:38:02.520 --> 03:38:04.729 align:start position:0%
bank digital currency
um

03:38:04.729 --> 03:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
let's see have I missed anything here uh
 
03:38:09.290 --> 03:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
also uh expiration dates this is another
 
03:38:12.050 --> 03:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
thing that has been done as well as as
 
03:38:13.729 --> 03:38:13.739 align:start position:0%
well as programming certain types of
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
inflation that are not
 
03:38:17.389 --> 03:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
um not in line with good market
 
03:38:17.399 --> 03:38:19.309 align:start position:0%
um not in line with good market
economics

03:38:19.309 --> 03:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
economics
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
um such as deciding all of a sudden
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
they're going to increase the amount of
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
currency in circulation but not increase
 
03:38:31.250 --> 03:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
your share of that currency thereby
 
03:38:33.769 --> 03:38:33.779 align:start position:0%
causing an inflation that devalues the
 
03:38:36.110 --> 03:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
currency you hold these are the kind of
 
03:38:37.969 --> 03:38:37.979 align:start position:0%
things that I believe we should be
 
03:38:40.610 --> 03:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
trying to prohibit now the the timing of
 
03:38:43.610 --> 03:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
this bill is quite important you'll see
 
03:38:45.889 --> 03:38:45.899 align:start position:0%
from one of the handouts that I had go
 
03:38:48.110 --> 03:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
around that the Federal Reserve has
 
03:38:50.349 --> 03:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
already partnered with the New York fed
 
03:38:53.510 --> 03:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
and big Banks to roll out a pilot
 
03:38:56.030 --> 03:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
program of this in New York so this is
 
03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
not something that's theoretical or
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
something that's coming down the road
 
03:39:01.610 --> 03:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
it's already here and they're on the
 
03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
verge of being able to launch this on a
 
03:39:06.950 --> 03:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
nationwide scale my concern is it could
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
even happen this year at the earliest
 
03:39:13.250 --> 03:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
um this would be horribly detrimental to
 
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
the rights of New Hampshire citizens
 
03:39:17.330 --> 03:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
regardless of the intent of Any Given
 
03:39:17.340 --> 03:39:18.889 align:start position:0%
regardless of the intent of Any Given
Administration

03:39:18.889 --> 03:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
03:39:22.250 --> 03:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
the next one could be totalitarian and
 
03:39:23.510 --> 03:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
they could come in and they could decide
 
03:39:25.729 --> 03:39:25.739 align:start position:0%
to use the technology to turn America
 
03:39:28.429 --> 03:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire into an open-air
 
03:39:31.190 --> 03:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
prison much like China is that's not
 
03:39:34.670 --> 03:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
something we can we can tolerate here
 
03:39:36.290 --> 03:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
um on that I'd be happy to take any
 
03:39:36.300 --> 03:39:42.830 align:start position:0%
um on that I'd be happy to take any
questions

03:39:42.830 --> 03:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:48.229 --> 03:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:51.170 --> 03:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you I went on the Federal Reserve
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
website they said that uh one of the
 
03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
Prime issues that they have is to
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
maintain privacy and that executive
 
03:40:01.070 --> 03:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
order says that they will maintain
 
03:40:01.080 --> 03:40:05.630 align:start position:0%
order says that they will maintain
privacy

03:40:05.630 --> 03:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
I would like uh okay okay so that my
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
I've done a lot of looking into this
 
03:40:14.570 --> 03:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
my question is since this is very
 
03:40:18.110 --> 03:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
hypothetical everything you talk about
 
03:40:20.570 --> 03:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
is very hypothetical has not happened
 
03:40:20.580 --> 03:40:21.590 align:start position:0%
is very hypothetical has not happened
yet

03:40:21.590 --> 03:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:40:24.170 --> 03:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
they've been talking and privacy is like
 
03:40:25.729 --> 03:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
number one issue
 
03:40:27.710 --> 03:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
they've been talking about how they
 
03:40:29.210 --> 03:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
might Implement they haven't implemented
 
03:40:32.450 --> 03:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
anything and in fact the Federal Reserve
 
03:40:34.250 --> 03:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
says they what they don't want to move
 
03:40:35.990 --> 03:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
unless they have agreement from Congress
 
03:40:37.969 --> 03:40:37.979 align:start position:0%
Congress already has several bills in
 
03:40:40.130 --> 03:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
place or working through the Congress
 
03:40:42.530 --> 03:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
that would ensure privacy that whatever
 
03:40:44.570 --> 03:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve implements has to have
 
03:40:47.809 --> 03:40:47.819 align:start position:0%
privacy as their top top priority
 
03:40:51.110 --> 03:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
my question is should should somehow
 
03:40:51.120 --> 03:40:52.670 align:start position:0%
my question is should should somehow
Congress

03:40:52.670 --> 03:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
falls on its face and the Federal
 
03:40:57.410 --> 03:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
Reserve turns out to fall on its face
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
and they issue a currency a digital
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
currency that is
 
03:41:06.170 --> 03:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
this state currently gets 5 billion
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
dollars a year that's B with a B from
 
03:41:13.250 --> 03:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
both Medicare and Social Security just
 
03:41:16.190 --> 03:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
those two Services alone this law would
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
say people those five billion dollars
 
03:41:23.330 --> 03:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:26.570 --> 03:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
that the total is about a hundred and
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's about 50 of the population would
 
03:41:31.849 --> 03:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
not get their Social Security checks nor
 
03:41:31.859 --> 03:41:33.889 align:start position:0%
not get their Social Security checks nor
would

03:41:33.889 --> 03:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:41:35.630 --> 03:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
they get their net nor would their
 
03:41:37.370 --> 03:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
Medicare get paid for
 
03:41:40.370 --> 03:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
is that what you envisioning happening
 
03:41:44.210 --> 03:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
with this in the hypothetical case where
 
03:41:47.870 --> 03:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
Congress and the FEDS fall on their face
 
03:41:49.490 --> 03:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
I I think I could pull a couple
 
03:41:51.050 --> 03:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
questions out of that to the answer the
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
first one as far as the hypotheticality
 
03:41:55.490 --> 03:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
of the of the question the privacy
 
03:41:57.590 --> 03:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
issues I believe there is a readily
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
available quote you can look it up
 
03:42:00.769 --> 03:42:00.779 align:start position:0%
online from Jerome Powell from the FED
 
03:42:03.410 --> 03:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
making clear that the the Central Bank
 
03:42:06.170 --> 03:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
digital currency they have worked on is
 
03:42:08.269 --> 03:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
not anonymous
 
03:42:09.950 --> 03:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
so that is that's something that's
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's out there you you can find that
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
um as far as the rest of the question
 
03:42:16.849 --> 03:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
goes we're getting into some details
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
there and I I don't need to go into
 
03:42:20.750 --> 03:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
details all I can say is you cannot put
 
03:42:26.510 --> 03:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:26.520 --> 03:42:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:42:27.840 --> 03:42:30.710 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much if I just look at
 
03:42:36.229 --> 03:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
the situation that we're in now
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
um credit cards
 
03:42:41.450 --> 03:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
um phone all of that could be traced I
 
03:42:43.490 --> 03:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
mean what is so different about this
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
that the government can't go into my
 
03:42:49.250 --> 03:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
credit card account and say he can't buy
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
lunch today or this and that and you
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
that that guy that murdered those kids
 
03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
in in Idaho uh is that what it was uh
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
the college kids yeah Idaho and they
 
03:43:03.650 --> 03:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
traced him with his all the blips of his
 
03:43:03.660 --> 03:43:05.030 align:start position:0%
traced him with his all the blips of his
phone

03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
phone
 
03:43:07.550 --> 03:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
um so I it seems to me that everything
 
03:43:10.670 --> 03:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're talking about now is
 
03:43:14.570 --> 03:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
already available to to a perverse
 
03:43:16.309 --> 03:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
government that wanted to use it I don't
 
03:43:19.130 --> 03:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
see that this really is that much more
 
03:43:22.130 --> 03:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
extreme thank you representative so that
 
03:43:23.570 --> 03:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
brings up a very good question and I
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
think there's some Nuance that needs to
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
be teased out a little bit so first of
 
03:43:29.150 --> 03:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
all this bill only addresses things that
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
are inherent to a currency
 
03:43:33.590 --> 03:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
meaning for instance you have a dollar
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
bill you go into a store you spend a
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
dollar bill
 
03:43:39.469 --> 03:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
that's a private transaction but if you
 
03:43:41.389 --> 03:43:41.399 align:start position:0%
decide to use your credit card well
 
03:43:43.070 --> 03:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's a mechanism that is not inherent
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
to the currency and that kind of
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
information can be traced the government
 
03:43:48.769 --> 03:43:48.779 align:start position:0%
you'll find out if they have a warrant
 
03:43:51.290 --> 03:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
to find out what happened
 
03:43:52.849 --> 03:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
and that's all that's all good and fine
 
03:43:54.830 --> 03:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm talking about with this bill is
 
03:43:56.290 --> 03:43:56.300 align:start position:0%
things that are inherent to the currency
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
so in other words the currency itself
 
03:44:00.290 --> 03:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
would have to have a built-in mechanism
 
03:44:03.290 --> 03:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
to actually provide this information to
 
03:44:04.250 --> 03:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
the government or the government
 
03:44:07.429 --> 03:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
Partners fed or whatever
 
03:44:09.170 --> 03:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
um automatically not through some
 
03:44:11.690 --> 03:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
secondary architecture that exists
 
03:44:14.330 --> 03:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
if that does that answer your question
 
03:44:16.370 --> 03:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
well I'm still wouldn't the government
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh under current circumstances need to
 
03:44:22.969 --> 03:44:22.979 align:start position:0%
need a a warrant to get in to see that
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh under current circumstances yes but
 
03:44:28.610 --> 03:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
with a with a cbdb they would not
 
03:44:30.530 --> 03:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't they still need a warrant
 
03:44:32.750 --> 03:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
to look at that information because a
 
03:44:35.630 --> 03:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
non-anonymous cbdb would have a would
 
03:44:38.090 --> 03:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism in place that makes
 
03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
this information
 
03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
readily available possibly even in a
 
03:44:44.330 --> 03:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
real-time manner
 
03:44:46.309 --> 03:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
I could compare it to all of these other
 
03:44:49.370 --> 03:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
programs we've heard about as of late
 
03:44:51.290 --> 03:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
um where the federal government has been
 
03:44:52.729 --> 03:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
looking into other things that they
 
03:44:53.929 --> 03:44:53.939 align:start position:0%
might maybe they shouldn't be looking
 
03:44:56.690 --> 03:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
into but when you add the technology to
 
03:44:59.389 --> 03:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
these sort of
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
to these sort of things it becomes much
 
03:45:01.439 --> 03:45:02.690 align:start position:0%
to these sort of things it becomes much
easier

03:45:02.690 --> 03:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
easier
 
03:45:05.450 --> 03:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
for them to create mechanisms that
 
03:45:05.460 --> 03:45:06.830 align:start position:0%
for them to create mechanisms that
automatically

03:45:06.830 --> 03:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
03:45:09.650 --> 03:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
allow them to look into private parts of
 
03:45:11.510 --> 03:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
people's lives and that's all this
 
03:45:12.889 --> 03:45:12.899 align:start position:0%
addresses it doesn't address it doesn't
 
03:45:14.090 --> 03:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
say they can't get a warrant for
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
information there's nothing wrong with
 
03:45:15.359 --> 03:45:17.710 align:start position:0%
information there's nothing wrong with
that

03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.090 --> 03:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
all right uh John stepped out of the
 
03:45:22.130 --> 03:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
room for singing uh I don't know who had
 
03:45:23.150 --> 03:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
their hand up first I'll go to
 
03:45:25.010 --> 03:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
03:45:27.170 --> 03:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
see uh you just said that there's no
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
price for freedom but
 
03:45:31.610 --> 03:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
this essentially takes away the freedom
 
03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
of people who may want to participate in
 
03:45:35.690 --> 03:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
something that perhaps is in some way
 
03:45:38.210 --> 03:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
more valuable as they deem so if for
 
03:45:39.650 --> 03:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
example this becomes some sort of
 
03:45:41.570 --> 03:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
standard if they have this new currency
 
03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
that's run by the fed and I find it to
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
be super convenient I'm willing to
 
03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
accept a little bit of loss of privacy
 
03:45:49.790 --> 03:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
you're now saying as a New Hampshire
 
03:45:51.469 --> 03:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
resident I would not be allowed to do
 
03:45:53.570 --> 03:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
that does that not take away some
 
03:45:56.269 --> 03:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
freedom of choice that no you're you're
 
03:45:58.010 --> 03:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
not exactly wrong about that and I've
 
03:45:59.809 --> 03:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
actually I've heard some similar things
 
03:46:02.330 --> 03:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
from what you might consider sort of
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
libertarian anarchists who would make
 
03:46:06.769 --> 03:46:06.779 align:start position:0%
the argument that by restricting a
 
03:46:09.530 --> 03:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
person's individual freedom to use a
 
03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
potentially tyrannical Central Bank
 
03:46:13.250 --> 03:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
digital currency you're infringing on
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
their freedom but we have to actually
 
03:46:17.630 --> 03:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
weigh that as it as a government and
 
03:46:19.610 --> 03:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
having the duty to protect our citizens
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
against the actual potential of this
 
03:46:29.150 --> 03:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
technology to truly create a unfree 1984
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
or type society and
 
03:46:34.370 --> 03:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
yes we do have to balance that little
 
03:46:35.809 --> 03:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
bit of that little bit of give and take
 
03:46:35.819 --> 03:46:38.630 align:start position:0%
bit of that little bit of give and take
there

03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:45.290 --> 03:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
sorry point of clarification you use the
 
03:46:47.929 --> 03:46:47.939 align:start position:0%
phrase cbdb what is that what does that
 
03:46:50.150 --> 03:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
stand I'm sorry cbdc Central Bank
 
03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
digital currency okay and then to go
 
03:46:56.269 --> 03:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
back to representative spire's earlier
 
03:46:56.279 --> 03:46:57.889 align:start position:0%
back to representative spire's earlier
question

03:46:57.889 --> 03:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:46:59.929 --> 03:46:59.939 align:start position:0%
would it and and you're the statement
 
03:47:02.349 --> 03:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
you just made
 
03:47:05.809 --> 03:47:05.819 align:start position:0%
is it possible for someone under your
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill living in New Hampshire to accept
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:14.450 --> 03:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
or they're they're simply opted they
 
03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
have to opt out there's a mechanical
 
03:47:18.769 --> 03:47:18.779 align:start position:0%
issue which I'm not clear on here that's
 
03:47:20.990 --> 03:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so just to
 
03:47:23.570 --> 03:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
clarify just to be very clear and I I
 
03:47:26.510 --> 03:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
maybe I shouldn't use the term cbdc
 
03:47:28.969 --> 03:47:28.979 align:start position:0%
um end this bill side by side because
 
03:47:31.910 --> 03:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
they're not exactly the same thing so a
 
03:47:34.610 --> 03:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
cbdc that does not violate the
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill that are
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
designed to protect the individual
 
03:47:41.030 --> 03:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
liberties of persons
 
03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
um would be fine it would not be
 
03:47:45.530 --> 03:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
disallowed but if they did decide to
 
03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
make the one that was inherently
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
compromising privacy rights inherently
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
programmable to prevent certain
 
03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:54.769 align:start position:0%
programmable to prevent certain
transactions

03:47:54.769 --> 03:47:54.779 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
03:47:58.490 --> 03:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
um then uh they to your specific
 
03:48:00.769 --> 03:48:00.779 align:start position:0%
question whether or not it could be sent
 
03:48:02.809 --> 03:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
to their bank account
 
03:48:05.150 --> 03:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a gray area maybe
 
03:48:07.070 --> 03:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
maybe not but it does Clearly say it
 
03:48:08.929 --> 03:48:08.939 align:start position:0%
wouldn't not you could not use it for
 
03:48:10.130 --> 03:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
any Dez public or private in the state
 
03:48:11.210 --> 03:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
03:48:13.370 --> 03:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
whether or not the federal government
 
03:48:15.650 --> 03:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
putting that into a bank account counts
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
exactly against that that's a little bit
 
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
of a gray area
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
but it's something that I gotta be
 
03:48:22.790 --> 03:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
honest I'm not particularly concerned
 
03:48:24.469 --> 03:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
about because this this bill is about
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
protecting Liberty of the people and
 
03:48:29.090 --> 03:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
they can design a cbdc that doesn't have
 
03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
these problems there's a bunch of
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
current crypto that doesn't have these
 
03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:36.410 align:start position:0%
current crypto that doesn't have these
problems

03:48:36.410 --> 03:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:39.349 --> 03:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh Gibbs please thank
 
03:48:39.359 --> 03:48:40.910 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh Gibbs please thank
you

03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned uh the workings of a
 
03:48:45.769 --> 03:48:45.779 align:start position:0%
central bank digital currency in
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
comparison to the workings of Bitcoin my
 
03:48:51.530 --> 03:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
question is would you trust whoever it
 
03:48:53.330 --> 03:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
is and I don't think we know honestly
 
03:48:57.170 --> 03:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
whoever it is who runs Bitcoin more than
 
03:48:59.450 --> 03:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
you would trust the Federal Reserve Bank
 
03:49:01.490 --> 03:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
and if so why
 
03:49:03.950 --> 03:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
well the way I understand it and I'm not
 
03:49:06.410 --> 03:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
an absolute expert on bitcoin but nobody
 
03:49:08.690 --> 03:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
actually runs Bitcoin it's a it's a it's
 
03:49:11.210 --> 03:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
a program where you kind of store this
 
03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
token on a hard drive somewhere
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
including possibly your own so you could
 
03:49:18.349 --> 03:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
be your own you know sort of Banker in
 
03:49:21.110 --> 03:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
that manner but what I trust them more
 
03:49:24.650 --> 03:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
than this than the Federal Reserve
 
03:49:24.660 --> 03:49:26.210 align:start position:0%
than this than the Federal Reserve
ah

03:49:26.210 --> 03:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
ah
 
03:49:27.889 --> 03:49:27.899 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure there's a whole lot of
 
03:49:30.170 --> 03:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
people that I wouldn't trust more than
 
03:49:31.370 --> 03:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve given the way
 
03:49:33.769 --> 03:49:33.779 align:start position:0%
they've handled currency
 
03:49:35.510 --> 03:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
further inquiry
 
03:49:38.570 --> 03:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
further inquiry thank you
 
03:49:38.580 --> 03:49:39.530 align:start position:0%
further inquiry thank you
um

03:49:39.530 --> 03:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:41.330 --> 03:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
how do we know that there's no
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
individual who runs Bitcoin I understand
 
03:49:45.889 --> 03:49:45.899 align:start position:0%
that there are computers all over the
 
03:49:48.670 --> 03:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
world uh apparently churning out
 
03:49:51.170 --> 03:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
Bitcoins in some way that I don't
 
03:49:53.809 --> 03:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
understand either but someone set up
 
03:49:57.229 --> 03:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
those computers so how do we know there
 
03:49:57.239 --> 03:49:58.070 align:start position:0%
those computers so how do we know there
isn't

03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
03:50:00.889 --> 03:50:00.899 align:start position:0%
someone or some group or some company
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
that runs Bitcoin uh thank you I so
 
03:50:07.550 --> 03:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
again my understanding is there is a
 
03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
fixed number of Bitcoin in the world and
 
03:50:11.450 --> 03:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
that doesn't increase
 
03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's just a program that
 
03:50:13.680 --> 03:50:15.290 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's just a program that
exists

03:50:15.290 --> 03:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
exists
 
03:50:18.170 --> 03:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
um but as far as how can we be sure
 
03:50:20.450 --> 03:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
somebody isn't running that behind the
 
03:50:20.460 --> 03:50:22.429 align:start position:0%
somebody isn't running that behind the
scenes

03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
scenes
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
I I don't exactly know how to answer
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
that question I think we're getting into
 
03:50:29.450 --> 03:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
the weeds discussing uh Bitcoin there's
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of different currencies we could
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
be discussing but let's go back to the
 
03:50:34.849 --> 03:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
03:50:36.650 --> 03:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
 
03:50:39.650 --> 03:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
did you have a question yes I I um my
 
03:50:41.090 --> 03:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
question well I've got about three of
 
03:50:43.729 --> 03:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
them but uh
 
03:50:45.889 --> 03:50:45.899 align:start position:0%
if the Federal Reserve decided to become
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
or uh have a digital currency why
 
03:50:53.570 --> 03:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:55.309 --> 03:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
well that that's more of a policy
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
question than a technical question uh
 
03:51:00.110 --> 03:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
obviously they have in many ways
 
03:51:02.690 --> 03:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
digitized the dollar
 
03:51:05.870 --> 03:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
um that that does exist as a thing to a
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
limited degree anyway but I believe the
 
03:51:10.010 --> 03:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
point of making essential Bank digital
 
03:51:12.769 --> 03:51:12.779 align:start position:0%
currency is actually to have a different
 
03:51:15.229 --> 03:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
currency that would be a policy
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
directive more than a technical thing
 
03:51:19.670 --> 03:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
all right I think so they could make the
 
03:51:23.090 --> 03:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve credit theoretically
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
um say we're going to have a digital
 
03:51:28.190 --> 03:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
currency it is the dollar it does uh it
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
does provide us with uh a digital dollar
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
to speed up settlement because that
 
03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
apparently is a is a Advantage
 
03:51:36.960 --> 03:51:37.610 align:start position:0%
apparently is a is a Advantage
um

03:51:37.610 --> 03:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:39.469 --> 03:51:39.479 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:51:41.210 --> 03:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
the other uh
 
03:51:42.769 --> 03:51:42.779 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming when you say the word
 
03:51:42.779 --> 03:51:44.150 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming when you say the word
autonomous

03:51:44.150 --> 03:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
autonomous
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
you are referring to the cryptocurrency
 
03:51:46.439 --> 03:51:47.809 align:start position:0%
you are referring to the cryptocurrency
ecology

03:51:47.809 --> 03:51:47.819 align:start position:0%
ecology
 
03:51:49.790 --> 03:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you repeat that
 
03:51:51.910 --> 03:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
when you say the word autonomous
 
03:51:54.650 --> 03:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
autonomous then I'm it sounds to me as
 
03:51:55.729 --> 03:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
though you're referring to the
 
03:51:57.769 --> 03:51:57.779 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency what I call the Ecology
 
03:51:59.870 --> 03:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
of the cryptocurrency it's a
 
03:52:03.769 --> 03:52:03.779 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer uh very uh secure type of
 
03:52:03.779 --> 03:52:04.610 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer uh very uh secure type of
uh

03:52:04.610 --> 03:52:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:08.210 --> 03:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
uh uh it's I'm sorry can you point me
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what reference you're making as
 
03:52:12.590 --> 03:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
far as autonomous is that in the bill
 
03:52:15.769 --> 03:52:15.779 align:start position:0%
what do we I'm trying to get it well I
 
03:52:18.050 --> 03:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
haven't read all the all your bill okay
 
03:52:20.690 --> 03:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
but you have made some things and I have
 
03:52:22.490 --> 03:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
questions about them number one you
 
03:52:25.010 --> 03:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
answered because the dollar could in
 
03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
in theory I believe it could be in
 
03:52:28.190 --> 03:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
theory yes
 
03:52:31.370 --> 03:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
um the uh when you use the word
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
autonomous I'm I'm not quite sure
 
03:52:38.570 --> 03:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:41.630 --> 03:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
I use the word several times in your I
 
03:52:43.190 --> 03:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
don't remember you saying the word but
 
03:52:45.170 --> 03:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
maybe you did I I'm sorry I I don't
 
03:52:46.849 --> 03:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
actually recall if I used it or what
 
03:52:49.010 --> 03:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
context I use it in well my
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
understanding would be that that is the
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrent one of the
 
03:52:55.190 --> 03:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies characteristics oh I
 
03:52:57.889 --> 03:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
believe I I think I know so I I may have
 
03:53:00.229 --> 03:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
suggested that the that the currency
 
03:53:02.269 --> 03:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
itself was okay
 
03:53:06.290 --> 03:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
um not was was decentralized it was not
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
um not like oh being as far as Bitcoin
 
03:53:11.090 --> 03:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
anyway not being overseen by some person
 
03:53:13.010 --> 03:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
or entity but rather
 
03:53:14.929 --> 03:53:14.939 align:start position:0%
unless you actually give it to a person
 
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
energy to oversee it is my understanding
 
03:53:20.530 --> 03:53:20.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean well crypto is
 
03:53:25.010 --> 03:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
decentralized uh finance and I get that
 
03:53:25.020 --> 03:53:25.610 align:start position:0%
decentralized uh finance and I get that
um

03:53:25.610 --> 03:53:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:27.290 --> 03:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
my third question
 
03:53:30.170 --> 03:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
is that the constitution gives a
 
03:53:33.650 --> 03:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
monopoly over the currency to Congress
 
03:53:36.170 --> 03:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
03:53:38.630 --> 03:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
my concern would one of my one of my
 
03:53:43.010 --> 03:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
concerns would be if a secondary another
 
03:53:48.530 --> 03:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.290 --> 03:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
in concert with the dollar I mean all of
 
03:53:53.750 --> 03:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
these things could happen
 
03:53:56.150 --> 03:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
um my my concern at that point would be
 
03:53:59.150 --> 03:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
who's going to control the money supply
 
03:54:01.729 --> 03:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
of the dollar and I I asked that
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
question because whoever does controls
 
03:54:08.030 --> 03:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.550 --> 03:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
I believe your question is who controls
 
03:54:14.330 --> 03:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
the the dollar itself who controls the
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
money supply you're asking or you're I
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
think one of your goals is to have
 
03:54:18.720 --> 03:54:20.570 align:start position:0%
think one of your goals is to have
cryptocurrency

03:54:20.570 --> 03:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
be part of the money supply
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
I I have no such goal in here my only
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
goal is to prevent the rollout of a
 
03:54:30.110 --> 03:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
certain type of digital currency that
 
03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
would be horribly detrimental to the
 
03:54:34.969 --> 03:54:34.979 align:start position:0%
individual liberties of people should
 
03:54:36.769 --> 03:54:36.779 align:start position:0%
they decide to flip that switch and and
 
03:54:38.809 --> 03:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
not take it in a nice Direction what
 
03:54:42.050 --> 03:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not sure we'll talk offline
 
03:54:47.090 --> 03:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the uh representative
 
03:54:47.100 --> 03:54:49.670 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the uh representative
spear

03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
spear
 
03:54:52.990 --> 03:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
I answer to both thank you
 
03:54:55.070 --> 03:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
I want to get back to my original
 
03:54:55.080 --> 03:54:56.570 align:start position:0%
I want to get back to my original
statement

03:54:56.570 --> 03:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
statement
 
03:55:01.250 --> 03:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
there are bills in Congress right now
 
03:55:03.950 --> 03:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
from a whole pot load of states
 
03:55:05.689 --> 03:55:05.699 align:start position:0%
that are telling the federal that are
 
03:55:08.510 --> 03:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
limiting the federal reserve's ability
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
to use account based
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
currency as opposed to token-based
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
currency and some hybrid thereof
 
03:55:19.849 --> 03:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
token based being totally Anonymous but
 
03:55:21.410 --> 03:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
very dangerous
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
account based being very unanonymous and
 
03:55:27.889 --> 03:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
not what people want those laws are
 
03:55:27.899 --> 03:55:28.610 align:start position:0%
not what people want those laws are
there

03:55:28.610 --> 03:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:55:30.889 --> 03:55:30.899 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this be or they're in the
 
03:55:33.410 --> 03:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
process this is a Federal Reserve
 
03:55:33.420 --> 03:55:34.910 align:start position:0%
process this is a Federal Reserve
situation

03:55:34.910 --> 03:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:55:37.490 --> 03:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
it hasn't happened yet don't know if
 
03:55:39.889 --> 03:55:39.899 align:start position:0%
it's another question representative is
 
03:55:41.150 --> 03:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
there a question in there okay yeah
 
03:55:44.150 --> 03:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
there is there is a question why my
 
03:55:46.250 --> 03:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:55:49.490 --> 03:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
why is this even being brought to the
 
03:55:51.650 --> 03:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
state level when it's in fact a federal
 
03:55:55.250 --> 03:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
level issue and should be handled at the
 
03:55:57.530 --> 03:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
federal level and they are working on it
 
03:55:59.689 --> 03:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
at the federal level why are you
 
03:56:01.309 --> 03:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
bringing it to the state uh thank you
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
for that question I am bringing it to
 
03:56:06.410 --> 03:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
the state because the the state is not
 
03:56:08.210 --> 03:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
in all things subservient to the federal
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
government we have the authority to
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
create a conflict with the federal
 
03:56:13.250 --> 03:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
government where there is constitutional
 
03:56:15.530 --> 03:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
issues involved they have coinage
 
03:56:17.630 --> 03:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
authority that's absolutely true but the
 
03:56:19.250 --> 03:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
federal government does not have the
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
authority to violate citizens Liberties
 
03:56:25.550 --> 03:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
through coinage and my intention and my
 
03:56:27.710 --> 03:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
hope is that by bringing such a bill
 
03:56:30.170 --> 03:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
having it passed it will put our state
 
03:56:32.929 --> 03:56:32.939 align:start position:0%
into a position to have the courts take
 
03:56:34.849 --> 03:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
a look at this issue and hopefully
 
03:56:36.769 --> 03:56:36.779 align:start position:0%
decide that such a currency that would
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
violate the rights of citizens is an
 
03:56:41.689 --> 03:56:41.699 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional matter
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
see you avoided avoided the
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency question all right thank
 
03:56:47.269 --> 03:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
you representative Gibbs question
 
03:56:49.370 --> 03:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
03:56:49.380 --> 03:56:50.150 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
um

03:56:50.150 --> 03:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:53.150 --> 03:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
I used the term Bitcoin
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
um a few minutes ago as an example
 
03:56:56.809 --> 03:56:56.819 align:start position:0%
representative Roy because you had
 
03:56:58.849 --> 03:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
referenced Bitcoin but it was really
 
03:57:02.450 --> 03:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
intended to be a broader question which
 
03:57:07.130 --> 03:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
is how do we know that we can or should
 
03:57:10.729 --> 03:57:10.739 align:start position:0%
have any trust in the people who set up
 
03:57:14.590 --> 03:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
the computer programs that are producing
 
03:57:17.870 --> 03:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency of any kind so that's an
 
03:57:19.790 --> 03:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
unrelated question to what we're talking
 
03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
about I know it might not seem like it
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
but it really is and uh that's a rabbit
 
03:57:24.650 --> 03:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
hole that would take an hour
 
03:57:26.090 --> 03:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
conversation so
 
03:57:28.849 --> 03:57:28.859 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind if I could just real
 
03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
briefly I would I would I would state
 
03:57:32.269 --> 03:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
that that is something of an
 
03:57:34.189 --> 03:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
epistemological question trying to seek
 
03:57:36.590 --> 03:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
out how do we ultimately find knowledge
 
03:57:38.689 --> 03:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
about something and it's the same answer
 
03:57:40.130 --> 03:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
to that as it would be to anything else
 
03:57:41.870 --> 03:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
you would have to investigate it go down
 
03:57:43.790 --> 03:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
those rabbit holes and then do you
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
really know the answer at the end I mean
 
03:57:55.550 --> 03:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:57.710 --> 03:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
all right well that's a good statement
 
03:57:59.389 --> 03:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and I'll just have
 
03:58:01.969 --> 03:58:01.979 align:start position:0%
my own personal would you believe uh the
 
03:58:04.010 --> 03:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
governor signed an executive order first
 
03:58:06.530 --> 03:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
one last year cryptocurrency commission
 
03:58:08.750 --> 03:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
we had almost a Year's worth of meetings
 
03:58:11.330 --> 03:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
we issued a report and in that report is
 
03:58:12.590 --> 03:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of definitions that are worth
 
03:58:15.050 --> 03:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
reading over one of those definitions is
 
03:58:16.729 --> 03:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
Central Bank digital currency with some
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks and then I made a personal
 
03:58:22.309 --> 03:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
statement in the appendix about the
 
03:58:25.250 --> 03:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
Central Bank digital currencies uh it
 
03:58:26.689 --> 03:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
might be interesting to read would you
 
03:58:28.189 --> 03:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
believe and a few of the commission
 
03:58:29.809 --> 03:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
members signed off on that statement so
 
03:58:31.969 --> 03:58:31.979 align:start position:0%
that might be something to help with
 
03:58:33.889 --> 03:58:33.899 align:start position:0%
background before we get into the
 
03:58:35.689 --> 03:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'll send a link to the
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee all right any other questions
 
03:58:38.640 --> 03:58:40.130 align:start position:0%
committee all right any other questions
okay

03:58:40.130 --> 03:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:42.349 --> 03:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your testimony
 
03:58:50.570 --> 03:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:52.490 --> 03:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
and next up we'll have representative
 
03:59:04.150 --> 03:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.610 --> 03:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
we're still on 225. yes we are still in
 
03:59:10.729 --> 03:59:10.739 align:start position:0%
houseville 225. representative whole
 
03:59:12.590 --> 03:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
um representing the towns of Dunbarton
 
03:59:15.469 --> 03:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
hooks at Allentown and epsom now known
 
03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
as Merrimack 27.
 
03:59:20.510 --> 03:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
testifying in favor of House Bill 225
 
03:59:22.250 --> 03:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
um for a little bit of History I want to
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
start back at the Constitutional
 
03:59:28.250 --> 03:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment that was adopted in 2018 the
 
03:59:29.929 --> 03:59:29.939 align:start position:0%
question was and I quote are you in
 
03:59:31.610 --> 03:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
favor of amending part first of the
 
03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
Constitution by inserting after article
 
03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
2A new article to read as follows
 
03:59:38.510 --> 03:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
article 2B right to privacy an
 
03:59:40.010 --> 03:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
individual's right to live free from
 
03:59:41.570 --> 03:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
government intrusion in private and
 
03:59:42.889 --> 03:59:42.899 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
03:59:45.950 --> 03:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent end quote
 
03:59:48.590 --> 03:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
that was adopted by 81 percent of the
 
03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
people who voted in 2018.
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's not a partisan issue that is an
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
overwhelming response in fact I've
 
03:59:56.750 --> 03:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
looked at the Constitutional Amendments
 
03:59:58.429 --> 03:59:58.439 align:start position:0%
over the last several decades and this
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
is one of the ones with the highest
 
04:00:02.809 --> 04:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
I say that because we all grew up in a
 
04:00:07.080 --> 04:00:08.269 align:start position:0%
I say that because we all grew up in a
society

04:00:08.269 --> 04:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
society
 
04:00:10.729 --> 04:00:10.739 align:start position:0%
where our transactions were Anonymous
 
04:00:15.050 --> 04:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
for those who had dollar bills when we
 
04:00:16.729 --> 04:00:16.739 align:start position:0%
went to the grocery store and bought
 
04:00:19.790 --> 04:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
eggs or milk okay and we handed over a
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
five dollar bill that was an anonymous
 
04:00:21.600 --> 04:00:23.330 align:start position:0%
five dollar bill that was an anonymous
transaction

04:00:23.330 --> 04:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
that is how we came to as a society over
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
the over decades right even more so when
 
04:00:31.910 --> 04:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
they were stamped coins without serial
 
04:00:33.769 --> 04:00:33.779 align:start position:0%
numbers on them
 
04:00:35.630 --> 04:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
when the Federal Reserve Reserve started
 
04:00:37.010 --> 04:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
putting serial numbers it became a
 
04:00:39.290 --> 04:00:39.300 align:start position:0%
little bit more traceable when you go to
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
the bank today and you ask for a stack
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
of 20s or if those who can afford for
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
larger denomination bills ask for them
 
04:00:48.410 --> 04:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
they come out of a magic money machine
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
they say that a little bit
 
04:00:50.990 --> 04:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
tongue-in-cheek but there is a machine
 
04:00:53.389 --> 04:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
that counts the money but it also in
 
04:00:56.450 --> 04:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
likely also records the serial numbers
 
04:00:57.769 --> 04:00:57.779 align:start position:0%
of every one of those bills that's
 
04:01:00.530 --> 04:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
handed over to you it is possible to do
 
04:01:02.510 --> 04:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
that it is not hard with optical
 
04:01:04.670 --> 04:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
character recognition in real time to
 
04:01:06.590 --> 04:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
scan an entire stack of bills and know
 
04:01:08.030 --> 04:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what serial numbers are being
 
04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
handed out that's not difficult with our
 
04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
modern technology
 
04:01:16.610 --> 04:01:16.620 align:start position:0%
this bill is forward-looking it is
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
trying to preserve what we've lived with
 
04:01:21.290 --> 04:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
and grown with and the society we've
 
04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
built that has worked so well for the
 
04:01:26.750 --> 04:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
decades in the past in in an era where
 
04:01:29.090 --> 04:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
all the transactions are online in real
 
04:01:31.490 --> 04:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
time every day
 
04:01:34.130 --> 04:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
customers have the choice today do they
 
04:01:36.170 --> 04:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
want to go buy something with their Visa
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
card which is a recorded transaction by
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
a private agency okay that is accessible
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
potentially to the banks as well as the
 
04:01:43.560 --> 04:01:44.450 align:start position:0%
potentially to the banks as well as the
government

04:01:44.450 --> 04:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:01:47.330 --> 04:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
or do they want to pay with cash
 
04:01:49.490 --> 04:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
and if they really are you flagging me
 
04:01:51.590 --> 04:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
down okay or or if they really want it
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
to be private it's coins not even dollar
 
04:01:56.450 --> 04:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
bills but that is that record there is
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
no record of that transaction
 
04:02:01.370 --> 04:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
the goal of this bill and if the
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
language needs tweaks I would gladly
 
04:02:05.450 --> 04:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
work on it is to make sure we preserve
 
04:02:07.790 --> 04:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
that status quo going forward
 
04:02:07.800 --> 04:02:09.349 align:start position:0%
that status quo going forward
because

04:02:09.349 --> 04:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:02:10.969 --> 04:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
it really isn't government's business
 
04:02:13.610 --> 04:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
whether you bought a dozen eggs or you
 
04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
you splurged at the eight dollars for
 
04:02:19.849 --> 04:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
the 18 eggs
 
04:02:22.729 --> 04:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
um my point is we should at least make
 
04:02:25.490 --> 04:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
sure we have the protections for our the
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
privacy of our citizens given that the
 
04:02:29.870 --> 04:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
citizens overwhelmingly just a few years
 
04:02:32.570 --> 04:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
ago supported a constitutional amendment
 
04:02:34.429 --> 04:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
regarding privacy
 
04:02:36.769 --> 04:02:36.779 align:start position:0%
secondly there was a comment made about
 
04:02:40.070 --> 04:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
the U.S Constitution about
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
coining money and I want to make sure
 
04:02:44.150 --> 04:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
that we're we're clear part first
 
04:02:45.889 --> 04:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
article sorry
 
04:02:48.710 --> 04:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
section one article eight
 
04:02:50.769 --> 04:02:50.779 align:start position:0%
specifies that the federal government
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
and I quote
 
04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
um where is it
 
04:02:56.929 --> 04:02:56.939 align:start position:0%
um two coin money regulate the value
 
04:02:59.330 --> 04:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
thereof and and a foreign coin and fix
 
04:03:00.710 --> 04:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
the standard and weights and measures
 
04:03:00.720 --> 04:03:02.210 align:start position:0%
the standard and weights and measures
unquote

04:03:02.210 --> 04:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give exclusive Authority it
 
04:03:07.490 --> 04:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
just says it can and there is a
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
fundamental difference it doesn't
 
04:03:12.110 --> 04:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
prohibit other groups from doing it in
 
04:03:14.090 --> 04:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
this section with that I'll close my
 
04:03:14.100 --> 04:03:15.769 align:start position:0%
this section with that I'll close my
testimony

04:03:15.769 --> 04:03:15.779 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
and if there's any questions I'll take
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
them or I'll go back to my questions
 
04:03:20.279 --> 04:03:23.150 align:start position:0%
them or I'll go back to my questions
Witness

04:03:23.150 --> 04:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you thank
 
04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
you representative hole
 
04:03:29.450 --> 04:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
and next we'll call Representative
 
04:03:32.150 --> 04:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
sellers uh supports the bill and asks
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.830 --> 04:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
04:03:44.150 --> 04:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak for a couple
 
04:03:46.010 --> 04:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
actually about a minute I said that song
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I really need
 
04:03:50.450 --> 04:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh just give an idea and just Bitcoin in
 
04:03:51.710 --> 04:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
general just in case you're not aware
 
04:03:54.050 --> 04:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
when you when you actually own Bitcoin
 
04:03:56.210 --> 04:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
you're your own bank and I use Bitcoin
 
04:03:57.950 --> 04:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
Loosely meaning all types of crypto
 
04:04:00.349 --> 04:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
coins you are the bank
 
04:04:03.410 --> 04:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
you lose it it's gone it's just an idea
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
so looking at this bill it says it says
 
04:04:08.150 --> 04:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
no currency and then it's trying to
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
describe the currency all right at that
 
04:04:12.530 --> 04:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
point and what they're trying to do is
 
04:04:15.050 --> 04:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
making sure we keep our privacy that's
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
all this bill is really trying to do to
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
keep our privacy I just looked on the 20
 
04:04:22.490 --> 04:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
bill I have in my pocket and it says for
 
04:04:26.090 --> 04:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
a it's a no for tender for a public or
 
04:04:29.809 --> 04:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
private transactions so we can use the
 
04:04:32.689 --> 04:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
cash dollar bill right now for a private
 
04:04:35.929 --> 04:04:35.939 align:start position:0%
transaction all right if my neighbor kid
 
04:04:37.729 --> 04:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
breaks my yard I can give them twenty
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
dollars it's a private transaction well
 
04:04:42.170 --> 04:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
if a cryptocurrency comes up or some
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
type of other currency are tangible what
 
04:04:46.010 --> 04:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
it might be I want to be able to use
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
that to pay my kid my next-door neighbor
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
kit to break my yard it could be still a
 
04:04:53.330 --> 04:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
private transaction we don't want to
 
04:04:54.889 --> 04:04:54.899 align:start position:0%
lose that and I think that's what we're
 
04:04:56.689 --> 04:04:56.699 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is is they're trying
 
04:04:58.630 --> 04:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
to protect the citizens of New Hampshire
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that's
 
04:05:02.269 --> 04:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
protected that's all we're doing and
 
04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
this is not Republican a Democrat this
 
04:05:07.250 --> 04:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
is everyone I think everybody from time
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
to time has some things they do they
 
04:05:11.450 --> 04:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
want to keep private all right so that's
 
04:05:12.650 --> 04:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is keep things
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
private thank you
 
04:05:18.050 --> 04:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for that succinct testimony
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right seeing done
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:26.269 --> 04:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:28.010 --> 04:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
is there a question I just wanted to
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative application so I think
 
04:05:31.790 --> 04:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
that you stated it you're not against
 
04:05:34.250 --> 04:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
the technology but you want to make sure
 
04:05:37.630 --> 04:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
the Privacy aspect is
 
04:05:41.689 --> 04:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
supported and adhered to in New
 
04:05:41.699 --> 04:05:43.330 align:start position:0%
supported and adhered to in New
Hampshire

04:05:43.330 --> 04:05:43.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:05:45.950 --> 04:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to say I'm against the
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
technology too but it's there's no
 
04:05:50.990 --> 04:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
stopping it it's it's it's coming a some
 
04:05:53.330 --> 04:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
type of cashless Society is coming so
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
therefore I just want if we can let's
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
keep it private as long as we can in New
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then follow up real quick
 
04:06:03.170 --> 04:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
so you're seeing that this is eventually
 
04:06:05.290 --> 04:06:05.300 align:start position:0%
a cash replacement
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
proposal eventually at the federal level
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
04:06:11.570 --> 04:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
from all I know and what's coming down
 
04:06:14.330 --> 04:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:15.950 --> 04:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and Representative Vincent
 
04:06:18.889 --> 04:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman I
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
stepped out for a minute I apologize too
 
04:06:22.490 --> 04:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
many meetings and too many people to
 
04:06:23.870 --> 04:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
make happy you'll keep happy yeah
 
04:06:26.570 --> 04:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
however and if you if you cover this I
 
04:06:29.389 --> 04:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
apologize to the committee but um a
 
04:06:32.330 --> 04:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
quick quick question here is
 
04:06:35.450 --> 04:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
is it dangerous to play this game uh
 
04:06:37.849 --> 04:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
with what we currently have
 
04:06:40.370 --> 04:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
meaning uh we already have a currency in
 
04:06:42.670 --> 04:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
place if we introduce another currency
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
uh are we playing with fire so to speak
 
04:06:47.870 --> 04:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
quick answer if you can
 
04:06:47.880 --> 04:06:49.450 align:start position:0%
quick answer if you can
foreign

04:06:49.450 --> 04:06:49.460 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
currency is coming if it's government or
 
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
whoever controls it I'm not sure who it
 
04:06:54.960 --> 04:06:56.450 align:start position:0%
whoever controls it I'm not sure who it
is

04:06:56.450 --> 04:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:06:58.969 --> 04:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
it's it's coming it's just the the whole
 
04:07:01.969 --> 04:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
point of think of this bill is we still
 
04:07:04.130 --> 04:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
want to be able to have to try to have
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
private transactions that's the whole
 
04:07:08.630 --> 04:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
key here is there's some way if they
 
04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
want to go digital or crypto or any
 
04:07:13.250 --> 04:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
other type of currency they want to do
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
is whatever it is in the future we don't
 
04:07:17.150 --> 04:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
want to each one of us have an account
 
04:07:19.849 --> 04:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure each one of us are
 
04:07:21.469 --> 04:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
individuals and keep our information
 
04:07:23.929 --> 04:07:23.939 align:start position:0%
private if we want to
 
04:07:25.729 --> 04:07:25.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:28.610 --> 04:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
all right okay question from uh you have
 
04:07:31.370 --> 04:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
a would you believe representative
 
04:07:35.090 --> 04:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
um would you believe
 
04:07:38.929 --> 04:07:38.939 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:07:40.969 --> 04:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
um today in the news
 
04:07:44.150 --> 04:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
there is a item that about four and a
 
04:07:46.670 --> 04:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
half billion dollars in crypto
 
04:07:48.590 --> 04:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
have been lost
 
04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
or stolen
 
04:07:52.370 --> 04:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
so and this is I know it doesn't sound
 
04:07:54.410 --> 04:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
like it but that's an unrelated topic
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's tangential but it's not I
 
04:07:58.490 --> 04:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
hear you're talking about something else
 
04:08:02.389 --> 04:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
we end up with dollars okay so and as a
 
04:08:04.969 --> 04:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
result and this is a very secretive
 
04:08:07.969 --> 04:08:07.979 align:start position:0%
system when you want to launder money
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
or you want to hide your tax cheat you
 
04:08:14.269 --> 04:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
want to hide money you want an anonymity
 
04:08:17.990 --> 04:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason why
 
04:08:21.710 --> 04:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
there is a pushback when you say
 
04:08:24.830 --> 04:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
freedom and you attach it to
 
04:08:28.689 --> 04:08:28.699 align:start position:0%
a lot of stuff but freedom from
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
freedom from being cut
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
by doing something illegal is something
 
04:08:37.370 --> 04:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
apparently I when I hear that it's
 
04:08:39.889 --> 04:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
almost like this is this is the danger
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
is like you I think you're you're
 
04:08:46.070 --> 04:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
wandering into territory that is uh
 
04:08:46.080 --> 04:08:46.849 align:start position:0%
wandering into territory that is uh
um

04:08:46.849 --> 04:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
right now all uh theoretical
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
and so we're constantly reminded that it
 
04:08:59.689 --> 04:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
is it is would you believe it is almost
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
or it's been proven it's almost
 
04:09:01.800 --> 04:09:03.769 align:start position:0%
or it's been proven it's almost
impossible

04:09:03.769 --> 04:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
to hide
 
04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
forever whatever you're doing
 
04:09:11.090 --> 04:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
and um uh so I have I have a lot of
 
04:09:11.100 --> 04:09:12.469 align:start position:0%
and um uh so I have I have a lot of
skepticism

04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
skepticism
 
04:09:15.290 --> 04:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
would you believe in would you be
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
replacing a dollar so yes I I believe
 
04:09:20.450 --> 04:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
you can't hide everything that is
 
04:09:22.670 --> 04:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
impossible but we're always going to
 
04:09:25.250 --> 04:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
have that element out there that is
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
trying to do something wrong and trying
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
to get you know to hide their money for
 
04:09:31.849 --> 04:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
one reason or another but we also we
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of citizens that just want to
 
04:09:36.769 --> 04:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
have their privacy so and that's what
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do in New Hampshire yeah
 
04:09:40.189 --> 04:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
we I don't want to see money laundering
 
04:09:42.050 --> 04:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's not necessary
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
but you have that element out there and
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
until they get caught you know we have
 
04:09:46.920 --> 04:09:47.870 align:start position:0%
until they get caught you know we have
them

04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:09:50.450 --> 04:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you very much for
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony we have two cards left
 
04:09:54.889 --> 04:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
for this thank you thank you
 
04:09:54.899 --> 04:09:56.090 align:start position:0%
for this thank you thank you
um

04:09:56.090 --> 04:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:00.050 --> 04:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
I'll call uh Joel Joel Venezuela and ask
 
04:10:01.550 --> 04:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
for 10 minutes maybe a little shorter
 
04:10:12.429 --> 04:10:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:14.689 --> 04:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
just turn on your mic there hit that
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
button there you go hey good afternoon
 
04:10:18.290 --> 04:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for the
 
04:10:20.809 --> 04:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide testimony today
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that this bill raises an
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
important issue and I'm in general
 
04:10:29.210 --> 04:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
support of of the uh the push to
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
preserve privacy however I do think that
 
04:10:33.370 --> 04:10:33.380 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill might
 
04:10:36.010 --> 04:10:36.020 align:start position:0%
unintentionally cause some legal
 
04:10:40.010 --> 04:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
complications for other forms of of
 
04:10:42.410 --> 04:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
digital assets such as cryptocurrencies
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
and um in particular
 
04:10:48.170 --> 04:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
um right here no currency whether
 
04:10:49.610 --> 04:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
tangible digital or otherwise which
 
04:10:51.889 --> 04:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
inherently compromises privacy by
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
provision of transaction or usage
 
04:10:55.969 --> 04:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
details to any government agency or
 
04:10:55.979 --> 04:10:57.050 align:start position:0%
details to any government agency or
partner

04:10:57.050 --> 04:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
partner
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
now most decentralized digital assets
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
run on public ledgers public blockchains
 
04:11:07.070 --> 04:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
and they tend to be pseudonymous meaning
 
04:11:08.689 --> 04:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily they aren't
 
04:11:10.910 --> 04:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
always tied to a physical identity
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
except uh
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
they still are all completely public and
 
04:11:19.130 --> 04:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
so for example if you make a payment and
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
that's tied to your public key or public
 
04:11:24.650 --> 04:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
address then that could be considered
 
04:11:28.689 --> 04:11:28.699 align:start position:0%
now that is provisioning
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
data to a government entity and
 
04:11:33.710 --> 04:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
compromising privacy and this could be
 
04:11:37.150 --> 04:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
used to apply to just about every
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
digital currency or digital asset out
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
there including Bitcoin and ethereum of
 
04:11:45.170 --> 04:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
course and it could of course end up
 
04:11:48.650 --> 04:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
providing a chilling effect to
 
04:11:51.170 --> 04:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
businesses seeking to do business in the
 
04:11:53.150 --> 04:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and decreasing
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Advantage it's so
 
04:11:58.670 --> 04:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
while I do support the general thrust of
 
04:12:02.269 --> 04:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
the bill to preserve individual privacy
 
04:12:05.570 --> 04:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
in finances I do think that there at
 
04:12:07.370 --> 04:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
least needs to be some rewording in
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
exactly the way this is written to not
 
04:12:10.439 --> 04:12:11.689 align:start position:0%
exactly the way this is written to not
necessarily

04:12:11.689 --> 04:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
04:12:14.330 --> 04:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
Encompass something that would ban an
 
04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
entire you know as of now perfectly
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
legal sector from doing business in New
 
04:12:19.560 --> 04:12:20.809 align:start position:0%
legal sector from doing business in New
Hampshire

04:12:20.809 --> 04:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any of
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
specific questions about this
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
could we get a name I don't have a
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
question and and a town and organization
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
is there yeah I'm Joelle Valenzuela I'm
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
a crypto and uh blockchain consultant
 
04:12:46.990 --> 04:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:49.490 --> 04:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
what's the word pseudonymous mean what's
 
04:12:52.070 --> 04:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
yes apologies for that it's
 
04:12:56.090 --> 04:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
it's um similar to so Anonymous means no
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
one knows who you are pseudonymous means
 
04:13:00.650 --> 04:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
everyone knows who you are through
 
04:13:00.660 --> 04:13:01.910 align:start position:0%
everyone knows who you are through
pseudonym

04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
pseudonym
 
04:13:04.610 --> 04:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
so for example it just it would be you
 
04:13:06.170 --> 04:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
know wait like for example if you have a
 
04:13:08.030 --> 04:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
social media handle sometimes people
 
04:13:09.410 --> 04:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
don't have those under their full name
 
04:13:11.570 --> 04:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
but they're very well known under that
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
handle and that's what pseudonymous is
 
04:13:17.290 --> 04:13:17.300 align:start position:0%
and so for example uh most popular
 
04:13:19.750 --> 04:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies are completely public
 
04:13:23.330 --> 04:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
and very easy to you know definitely
 
04:13:25.969 --> 04:13:25.979 align:start position:0%
much more easy than the US dollar to
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
examine every single transaction out
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
there except that the ID
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
um identity behind everyone who uses
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
them is not always known of course this
 
04:13:37.610 --> 04:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
is becoming increasingly more known as
 
04:13:39.889 --> 04:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
there's they're more Associated to for
 
04:13:42.170 --> 04:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
example certain financial institutions
 
04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'm fine just another pseudonymous uh so
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
would I be correct in saying that an
 
04:13:49.920 --> 04:13:51.830 align:start position:0%
would I be correct in saying that an
illegal

04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
drug cartel
 
04:13:55.929 --> 04:13:55.939 align:start position:0%
could use a system
 
04:13:59.570 --> 04:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
in have a pseudonymous name
 
04:14:04.130 --> 04:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
and that would uh make it easier to get
 
04:14:07.010 --> 04:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
dollars for it or Euros or anything like
 
04:14:09.650 --> 04:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
that would pseudonymous be an attraction
 
04:14:12.950 --> 04:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
to that kind of activity I personally
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
don't think so because uh at the state
 
04:14:18.769 --> 04:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
of the way the technology is today uh
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
blockchain analytics companies have had
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
quite a good track record of working
 
04:14:26.210 --> 04:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement and associating
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
individual transactions and individual
 
04:14:31.010 --> 04:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
addresses especially across the more
 
04:14:32.929 --> 04:14:32.939 align:start position:0%
popular networks of Bitcoin and ethereum
 
04:14:35.809 --> 04:14:35.819 align:start position:0%
to individual identities especially at
 
04:14:39.469 --> 04:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
entry and exit points into you know US
 
04:14:41.929 --> 04:14:41.939 align:start position:0%
dollars for example so I don't really
 
04:14:46.330 --> 04:14:46.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:52.130 --> 04:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
Joel just one more time for the record
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
you're representing yourself yes in
 
04:14:58.370 --> 04:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
another company yes my company desk
 
04:15:01.370 --> 04:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
Center LLC okay can you spell that
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
please d s c e n t r okay thank you any
 
04:15:09.530 --> 04:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
um I have one if that's okay yes could
 
04:15:14.570 --> 04:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
you explain the difference between
 
04:15:16.670 --> 04:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
a dollar bill that is a piece of paper
 
04:15:18.650 --> 04:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
that I put here and maybe the wind blows
 
04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
it and it moves uh and maybe it doesn't
 
04:15:23.630 --> 04:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
and electronic currency that's
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
programmable could you explain the
 
04:15:27.050 --> 04:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
difference between those two things and
 
04:15:29.330 --> 04:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
how it relates to the bill
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
might take a while to go through all the
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
particulars because there's a large Gulf
 
04:15:35.689 --> 04:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
behind that but essentially the money
 
04:15:38.210 --> 04:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
most of us use today could be considered
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
a central bank digital currency in that
 
04:15:42.410 --> 04:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's issued by a central bank it is a
 
04:15:44.929 --> 04:15:44.939 align:start position:0%
currency and it is digitally represented
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
a few few of us use the majority or all
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
of our transactions in paper cash and so
 
04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
already there are digital ledgers
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
between Banks and other financial
 
04:15:58.729 --> 04:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
institutions that do transmit the dollar
 
04:16:01.790 --> 04:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
value between different accounts and so
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh when you go go to a one of the
 
04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
challenges with the whole cbdc issue is
 
04:16:12.050 --> 04:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
that it Still Remains extremely vague as
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
to what exactly specifics will kind of
 
04:16:17.630 --> 04:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
constitute that and so as far as
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
programmable money
 
04:16:22.370 --> 04:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
um there are certain uh blockchains
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
which can be used to sort of set to
 
04:16:29.330 --> 04:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
preset certain conditions for usage and
 
04:16:31.610 --> 04:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
as opposed to for example when you a
 
04:16:33.530 --> 04:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
manual way whereas you call your bank
 
04:16:35.570 --> 04:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
and your bank says you can't send to
 
04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
this account we put a freeze on your
 
04:16:38.210 --> 04:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
account because of this or whatever that
 
04:16:40.250 --> 04:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
would be like a manual way and it is
 
04:16:41.929 --> 04:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
possible to kind of automate some of
 
04:16:45.610 --> 04:16:45.620 align:start position:0%
these things for example there's a a
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
token called usdc which is a US dollar
 
04:16:53.450 --> 04:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
backed stablecoin which is on several
 
04:16:55.849 --> 04:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
networks it's basically a representation
 
04:16:58.130 --> 04:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
of US dollar that's backed one to one by
 
04:17:00.769 --> 04:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
actual dollars in the bank somewhere and
 
04:17:04.010 --> 04:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
in that are programmed some limitations
 
04:17:07.130 --> 04:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
of where can be sent for example
 
04:17:08.809 --> 04:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
um sanctioned addresses by the US
 
04:17:10.849 --> 04:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
government are are there's a list of
 
04:17:12.290 --> 04:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
these sanctioned addresses and
 
04:17:13.849 --> 04:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
programmatically it just can't be sent
 
04:17:17.570 --> 04:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
there so rather than a bank which then
 
04:17:19.729 --> 04:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
would have to sort of manually figure
 
04:17:22.370 --> 04:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
out where you can and can't send
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
something like this it's something like
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
this can just be kind of inherently
 
04:17:28.729 --> 04:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
programmed into the the token
 
04:17:30.349 --> 04:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and uh
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative post do you have a
 
04:17:31.560 --> 04:17:33.050 align:start position:0%
representative post do you have a
question

04:17:33.050 --> 04:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much
 
04:17:36.710 --> 04:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for being here today
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
it's very interesting but as you're
 
04:17:41.150 --> 04:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
saying all of this in answer to
 
04:17:43.729 --> 04:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon all I'm thinking of
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
is we already had that it's the credit
 
04:17:49.010 --> 04:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
card I I sign up for a credit card they
 
04:17:51.769 --> 04:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
give me twenty thousand dollars to play
 
04:17:54.889 --> 04:17:54.899 align:start position:0%
with right I pay my bills with it then
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
that when when after I pay my bills and
 
04:18:00.050 --> 04:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
I have to pay the credit card I log on
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
to my bank and pay it there put in my my
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
bank number and they take it never never
 
04:18:09.650 --> 04:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
touch a dollar at all so would you say
 
04:18:11.929 --> 04:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
that this is similar although it would
 
04:18:15.229 --> 04:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
be a bank rather than a credit card
 
04:18:18.290 --> 04:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
yes in this case it would be I suppose
 
04:18:22.250 --> 04:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
similar mostly in my opinion again this
 
04:18:24.410 --> 04:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is still rapidly
 
04:18:27.050 --> 04:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
developing not only technology but also
 
04:18:29.210 --> 04:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
policy across a wide variety of world
 
04:18:33.229 --> 04:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
governments the cbdc concept
 
04:18:36.530 --> 04:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
seems to focus more on trying to
 
04:18:39.309 --> 04:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
consolidate and simplify payment rails
 
04:18:42.229 --> 04:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
rather than to do something entirely
 
04:18:45.410 --> 04:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
different now obviously that could be
 
04:18:47.389 --> 04:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
completely untrue of a different country
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
cbdc or the Federal Reserve comes out
 
04:18:51.170 --> 04:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
with something different next week that
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
ends up being different but mostly yeah
 
04:18:55.490 --> 04:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
I would say this is on the whole nothing
 
04:18:57.769 --> 04:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
new to a lot of the systems we have
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
today it would just be a an update and a
 
04:19:03.889 --> 04:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
consolidation of the payment technology
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
behind it
 
04:19:08.210 --> 04:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so with a credit card
 
04:19:14.150 --> 04:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
um they track everything they do they
 
04:19:16.010 --> 04:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I can look on my Facebook account
 
04:19:19.309 --> 04:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
and it'll tell me just what I looked at
 
04:19:22.670 --> 04:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
um on Amazon right yes how how would we
 
04:19:27.050 --> 04:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
Preserve with this type of currency that
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
we aren't tracked on every little thing
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
so can I just jump in so your credit
 
04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
card is a private company the cdbc would
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
be run by the government so you'd
 
04:19:37.849 --> 04:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
basically be handing over all of your
 
04:19:39.769 --> 04:19:39.779 align:start position:0%
transactional data every cup of coffee
 
04:19:42.290 --> 04:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
you buy you'd be handing over that data
 
04:19:43.969 --> 04:19:43.979 align:start position:0%
to the government and they would promise
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
to not spy on you or Snoop on you so
 
04:19:48.349 --> 04:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
your credit card company
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't well I may not
 
04:19:52.490 --> 04:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
um but a credit card company is a
 
04:19:54.050 --> 04:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
private institution and we have we
 
04:19:55.490 --> 04:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
currently have a private banking system
 
04:19:59.150 --> 04:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
so if that helps explain it is that yes
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
all right let's we're going to move on
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
all right uh is that okay unless you
 
04:20:03.469 --> 04:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
have something else to say no with just
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
my primary concern with this is just
 
04:20:08.809 --> 04:20:08.819 align:start position:0%
that the language of the bill has a lot
 
04:20:10.969 --> 04:20:10.979 align:start position:0%
of potential unintended consequences and
 
04:20:10.979 --> 04:20:11.689 align:start position:0%
of potential unintended consequences and
I'm

04:20:11.689 --> 04:20:11.699 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:20:14.090 --> 04:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to suggest a few okay
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm not a legislature
 
04:20:17.689 --> 04:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
legislator but I'm happy to suggest a
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
few small edits that could possibly turn
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
it into a a direction where the original
 
04:20:25.189 --> 04:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
intent is preserved and then can be
 
04:20:27.110 --> 04:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
voted obviously yes or no at that stage
 
04:20:28.969 --> 04:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't have these unintended
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
consequences so just for the record
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
you're opposed to the bill but you may
 
04:20:34.370 --> 04:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
have suggestions for our subcommittee
 
04:20:36.650 --> 04:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
which will happen in the next week or so
 
04:20:38.330 --> 04:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct any other questions
 
04:20:42.050 --> 04:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative spear
 
04:20:45.050 --> 04:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you I had mentioned before about
 
04:20:47.689 --> 04:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
how in the wording that's current
 
04:20:50.570 --> 04:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
they're currently there and should the
 
04:20:52.429 --> 04:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve
 
04:20:55.729 --> 04:20:55.739 align:start position:0%
Implement a uh digital currency that is
 
04:20:57.710 --> 04:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
not private which they said they don't
 
04:20:59.570 --> 04:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
want to do but if they did
 
04:20:59.580 --> 04:21:03.110 align:start position:0%
want to do but if they did
hypothetically

04:21:03.110 --> 04:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:06.410 --> 04:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
isn't do you see a problem with the
 
04:21:09.110 --> 04:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
wording as it exists that people getting
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
their Medicare and their Social Security
 
04:21:11.279 --> 04:21:15.110 align:start position:0%
their Medicare and their Social Security
payments

04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
um potentially I guess we'd have to see
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
which form this kind of system ends up
 
04:21:23.150 --> 04:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
taking but in general I
 
04:21:26.229 --> 04:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor I personally do not favor
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh language which would tend to
 
04:21:31.849 --> 04:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
I which could have the possibility of
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
banning or accidentally limiting or
 
04:21:36.349 --> 04:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
Banning a wide variety of things I'd
 
04:21:39.530 --> 04:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
rather I personally rather focus on
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
Banning Banning if that makes sense is
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
in not forcing people to use a certain
 
04:21:46.610 --> 04:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
thing or not but once a lot of times
 
04:21:47.929 --> 04:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
when you become a little bit too
 
04:21:49.729 --> 04:21:49.739 align:start position:0%
sweeping with this kind of language you
 
04:21:50.809 --> 04:21:50.819 align:start position:0%
could have a lot of unintended
 
04:21:55.969 --> 04:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
all right representative Terry uh you
 
04:22:00.650 --> 04:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
have spoken you have spoken uh of
 
04:22:02.570 --> 04:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences what you believe
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
to be unintended consequences uh will
 
04:22:08.330 --> 04:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
you be submitting uh formally submitting
 
04:22:11.929 --> 04:22:11.939 align:start position:0%
your suggested tweaks changes to the
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
language to improve the bill to the
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
subject to the committee yes I can if
 
04:22:18.110 --> 04:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
that is useful to the committee could we
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
ask him to do so yes yes uh please do
 
04:22:22.490 --> 04:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
that the committee uh email address is
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
on the state's website thank you thank
 
04:22:25.729 --> 04:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
you thank you all right thank you Mr
 
04:22:29.450 --> 04:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
Venezuela thank you and the last stop we
 
04:22:30.830 --> 04:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
have this is the last card for this bill
 
04:22:37.550 --> 04:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.610 --> 04:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
and Lily if you could uh you asked for
 
04:22:41.929 --> 04:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
five to eight minutes if you could be
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.189 --> 04:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
well thank you for having me back and
 
04:22:52.969 --> 04:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
this is a bill actually intend to come
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
here initially
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
um the China right now actually is
 
04:23:01.550 --> 04:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
taking the word a leading rule in
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
developing digital and currency that is
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
a totally centralized and pushed down to
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
their citizens you know why they start
 
04:23:14.170 --> 04:23:14.180 align:start position:0%
to do this because exactly
 
04:23:17.809 --> 04:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies they
 
04:23:21.410 --> 04:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
saw them decentralized and Chinese
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
people were trying to invest in those
 
04:23:27.530 --> 04:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
crypto this so that was a big threat to
 
04:23:29.809 --> 04:23:29.819 align:start position:0%
their regime and the economy and the
 
04:23:34.189 --> 04:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
political system so they banned Bitcoin
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
and other cryptocurrencies and they're
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
trying to develop their own digital un
 
04:23:43.130 --> 04:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
since 2014 and of course I totally
 
04:23:44.809 --> 04:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
understand why they're doing that
 
04:23:47.950 --> 04:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
because that's unelected you know almost
 
04:23:51.290 --> 04:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
indigen English like a legitimate
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
government people deny elect them and
 
04:23:55.370 --> 04:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
they want to control the money they
 
04:23:58.490 --> 04:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
don't want to citizens to transfer their
 
04:24:00.910 --> 04:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
money to overseas to any other Market
 
04:24:04.250 --> 04:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
they do to be threat to them
 
04:24:08.090 --> 04:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
but what I want to warn people is that
 
04:24:11.330 --> 04:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
but they are their tactics their
 
04:24:15.469 --> 04:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
behaviors and their beliefs are now are
 
04:24:19.130 --> 04:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
on equal word economical form website so
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
the other countries are saying oh that's
 
04:24:23.929 --> 04:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
convenient that's efficient we should
 
04:24:27.110 --> 04:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
learn from China we want to do our maybe
 
04:24:28.969 --> 04:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
Global Central Bank in different
 
04:24:31.610 --> 04:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
countries their digital currencies but
 
04:24:34.370 --> 04:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
what they don't tell you is how Chinese
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
citizens are subject to completely
 
04:24:41.150 --> 04:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
losing their civil liberties and privacy
 
04:24:44.150 --> 04:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
I grew up in China I never had any in
 
04:24:46.849 --> 04:24:46.859 align:start position:0%
privacy I mean it was alien concept to
 
04:24:49.610 --> 04:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
me civil liberties and concept like that
 
04:24:52.250 --> 04:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
but now with this digital currency they
 
04:24:54.110 --> 04:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
are already pushing down to 10 percent
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
of population which is over 130 meaning
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
Chinese now are using digital Yen and
 
04:25:03.650 --> 04:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
it's on their cell phone everything's
 
04:25:05.990 --> 04:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
Transit is not on their cell phone based
 
04:25:09.290 --> 04:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
on a QR code so they track every
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
transition you have there's a funny joke
 
04:25:15.769 --> 04:25:15.779 align:start position:0%
a CCP official you know use that digital
 
04:25:17.870 --> 04:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
currency on cell phone to pay for
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
prostitution next they got arrested
 
04:25:22.849 --> 04:25:22.859 align:start position:0%
immediately like how stupid is that like
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
did you know they are tracking you every
 
04:25:28.490 --> 04:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
move so so this is a potentially very
 
04:25:32.150 --> 04:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous to our civil liberties in this
 
04:25:35.210 --> 04:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
country if we allow central government
 
04:25:37.969 --> 04:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve to push it down on us
 
04:25:40.729 --> 04:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
you know we can discuss the language to
 
04:25:42.769 --> 04:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
improve the bill and all for that but I
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
just want to earn that it is a very
 
04:25:49.010 --> 04:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
dangerous Potential Threat to our
 
04:25:52.849 --> 04:25:52.859 align:start position:0%
privacy our rights that specified in the
 
04:25:56.229 --> 04:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
U.S Constitution and in New Hampshire
 
04:25:59.590 --> 04:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I still very very
 
04:26:02.750 --> 04:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
mind-boggling why the world is learning
 
04:26:06.649 --> 04:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
so much from my native country a China
 
04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
communist party their behaviors
 
04:26:11.750 --> 04:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
techniques tactics
 
04:26:14.689 --> 04:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
and and the styles of controlling their
 
04:26:16.250 --> 04:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
citizens we're all trying to get away
 
04:26:19.010 --> 04:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
coming here to run away from that but
 
04:26:22.189 --> 04:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
here I am testifying telling our stories
 
04:26:25.490 --> 04:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
to say we don't want to learn from them
 
04:26:28.269 --> 04:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
at all they have a completely different
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
ideologies Concepts they do not value
 
04:26:35.450 --> 04:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
human lives and human privacy so I'm
 
04:26:39.290 --> 04:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
here to support the bill by myself a
 
04:26:42.530 --> 04:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
American citizen and by choice and I
 
04:26:44.510 --> 04:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
hope that the bill can be improved that
 
04:26:48.110 --> 04:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
way that you know we can get this voted
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
down thank you very much I'll be happy
 
04:26:53.389 --> 04:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
to take your questions
 
04:26:56.689 --> 04:26:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:58.429 --> 04:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
okay I guess we're good thank you very
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
04:27:04.130 --> 04:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any other questions or
 
04:27:06.649 --> 04:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
any other pink sheets uh would someone
 
04:27:10.130 --> 04:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.809 --> 04:27:11.819 align:start position:0%
with someone yeah grab the blue sheet
 
04:27:14.450 --> 04:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
this is uh 225
 
04:27:14.460 --> 04:27:16.189 align:start position:0%
this is uh 225
225

04:27:16.189 --> 04:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
225
 
04:27:17.809 --> 04:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
right and with that we'll close the
 
04:27:34.010 --> 04:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.020 --> 04:27:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
just

04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:45.229 --> 04:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
okay on the blue sheet we've had uh six
 
04:27:46.670 --> 04:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
people signed in on the blue sheet for
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
two two five
 
04:27:55.790 --> 04:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
so we'll open the hearing on House Bill
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
227 and we'll call
 
04:28:03.170 --> 04:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
we'll call Rep
 
04:28:26.050 --> 04:28:26.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.450 --> 04:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee and I'm
 
04:28:31.610 --> 04:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
representative JD Bernardi I represent
 
04:28:35.030 --> 04:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 36 which is Hampton Falls
 
04:28:37.370 --> 04:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
Kensington Southampton Newton and
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
Plaistow Southeast New Hampshire I'm
 
04:28:44.290 --> 04:28:44.300 align:start position:0%
here to rise in support of House Bill
 
04:28:48.590 --> 04:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
227 Fair access to financial services
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
the thrust of this bill is the financial
 
04:28:53.570 --> 04:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
institutions and I'll just use Banks the
 
04:28:55.450 --> 04:28:55.460 align:start position:0%
shorthand from now on
 
04:28:58.610 --> 04:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
not deny a financial service unless a
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
person fails to meet traditional
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
quantitative impartial risk-based
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
standards established in advance so this
 
04:29:11.689 --> 04:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
is your traditional financing criteria
 
04:29:14.570 --> 04:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
what does this mean it means that you
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
cannot then add criteria like ESG d-i-j
 
04:29:22.450 --> 04:29:22.460 align:start position:0%
or any other non-traditional
 
04:29:25.729 --> 04:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
non-financial criteria as the basis of
 
04:29:28.610 --> 04:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
making operational decisions in your
 
04:29:28.620 --> 04:29:30.530 align:start position:0%
making operational decisions in your
bank

04:29:30.530 --> 04:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
bank
 
04:29:32.330 --> 04:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
why should we care
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
because currently banking industry is
 
04:29:38.450 --> 04:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
adopting these kinds of criteria which
 
04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent with traditional
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
Financial criteria
 
04:29:46.250 --> 04:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
the largest organization doing this is
 
04:29:47.410 --> 04:29:47.420 align:start position:0%
the U.N
 
04:29:50.269 --> 04:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
Affiliated organization
 
04:29:51.889 --> 04:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
it's part of the Glasgow Financial
 
04:29:54.170 --> 04:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
Alliance for Net Zero
 
04:29:55.910 --> 04:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's called The Net Zero banking
 
04:29:58.729 --> 04:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
Alliance I have
 
04:30:02.229 --> 04:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
um passed around a uh a sheet here
 
04:30:02.239 --> 04:30:03.849 align:start position:0%
um passed around a uh a sheet here
indicating

04:30:03.849 --> 04:30:03.859 align:start position:0%
indicating
 
04:30:07.610 --> 04:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
their membership in the United States
 
04:30:07.620 --> 04:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
their membership in the United States
um

04:30:08.389 --> 04:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
this is directly from their website
 
04:30:12.110 --> 04:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
that's why it's printed the way it is I
 
04:30:14.689 --> 04:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
could have made it look fancier but this
 
04:30:17.889 --> 04:30:17.899 align:start position:0%
is their website so it's their data
 
04:30:20.929 --> 04:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
125 Banks internationally in 41
 
04:30:23.809 --> 04:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
countries representing 73 trillion
 
04:30:27.410 --> 04:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
dollars in assets or 41 of global
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
banking assets
 
04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
I've listed the U.S companies and you
 
04:30:34.189 --> 04:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
see first Amalgamated Bank which most
 
04:30:36.050 --> 04:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
probably don't know that's the bank of
 
04:30:39.130 --> 04:30:39.140 align:start position:0%
all the trade unions AFL-CIO
 
04:30:41.389 --> 04:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
Teamsters whatever
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
um then you see most of the major banks
 
04:30:46.910 --> 04:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the U.S in fact the top six
 
04:30:49.250 --> 04:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
Banks Bank of America is number two in
 
04:30:50.450 --> 04:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
the U.S
 
04:30:53.630 --> 04:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
Citibank number six JP Morgan Chase
 
04:30:56.210 --> 04:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
number one Morgan Stanley number four
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
Goldman Sachs number five Wells Fargo
 
04:31:02.330 --> 04:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
number three so the top six banks in the
 
04:31:05.570 --> 04:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
United States have all signed on to
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
moving these criteria forward
 
04:31:12.349 --> 04:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
well why do we care that they're
 
04:31:15.649 --> 04:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
implementing ESG criteria
 
04:31:19.010 --> 04:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
the results of these criteria are
 
04:31:21.229 --> 04:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
essentially stopping or restricting
 
04:31:25.790 --> 04:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
things like financing of coal oil and
 
04:31:25.800 --> 04:31:26.570 align:start position:0%
things like financing of coal oil and
gas

04:31:26.570 --> 04:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
gas
 
04:31:29.570 --> 04:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
Citibank has dropped 100 percent of its
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
financing of coal
 
04:31:35.050 --> 04:31:35.060 align:start position:0%
ninety percent of the exploration
 
04:31:39.410 --> 04:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
production shipping pipelines activity
 
04:31:42.769 --> 04:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
in the United States has been stopped
 
04:31:45.769 --> 04:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
for oil and gas
 
04:31:48.170 --> 04:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
by these Banks
 
04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
what does this mean locally
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
your fuel oil your natural gas your LP
 
04:31:57.469 --> 04:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
gas prices are all going to go up
 
04:32:01.370 --> 04:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
because of shortened supplies and this
 
04:32:03.889 --> 04:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
happened long before
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
the whole Ukraine situation started this
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
happened two years ago the initiation
 
04:32:12.889 --> 04:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:15.290 --> 04:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
these criteria require restricting
 
04:32:18.490 --> 04:32:18.500 align:start position:0%
financing of farming activities
 
04:32:20.450 --> 04:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
internationally as well as the United
 
04:32:20.460 --> 04:32:21.950 align:start position:0%
internationally as well as the United
States

04:32:21.950 --> 04:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
States
 
04:32:23.889 --> 04:32:23.899 align:start position:0%
so in the United States
 
04:32:26.570 --> 04:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
follow the news you see Bill Gates is
 
04:32:29.210 --> 04:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
buying up massive stretches of farmland
 
04:32:31.849 --> 04:32:31.859 align:start position:0%
and taking them out of production
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
you've seen major riots in Netherlands
 
04:32:40.149 --> 04:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
Sri Lanka and Ghana and even Canada over
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
the control and loss of Farmland
 
04:32:44.040 --> 04:32:45.469 align:start position:0%
the control and loss of Farmland
production

04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
production
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
you've seen restriction in financing of
 
04:32:49.370 --> 04:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
firearms companies and ammunition
 
04:32:49.380 --> 04:32:52.189 align:start position:0%
firearms companies and ammunition
manufacturers

04:32:52.189 --> 04:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
I'd like to give you a quote on how this
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
is all supposed to work by Brian
 
04:32:59.809 --> 04:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
Moynihan who's the CEO of Bank of
 
04:33:01.849 --> 04:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
America that number two company on the
 
04:33:01.859 --> 04:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
America that number two company on the
list

04:33:03.110 --> 04:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
list
 
04:33:06.170 --> 04:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
take our 200 000 people
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
3 trillion balance sheet
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
60 billion of expenses you start aiming
 
04:33:15.529 --> 04:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
that gun and you take that across all
 
04:33:18.769 --> 04:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
these companies and it's huge it's
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
actually the operating companies that
 
04:33:23.090 --> 04:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
will make the change happen and the
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
activities they force Downstream are
 
04:33:28.070 --> 04:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
just unbelievable
 
04:33:31.730 --> 04:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
now all six companies on this list have
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
similar kinds of quotes by their CEOs or
 
04:33:38.090 --> 04:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
various Representatives
 
04:33:40.670 --> 04:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
so not only are these companies adopting
 
04:33:43.730 --> 04:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
ESG criteria for their own business as
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Moynihan is saying but also allowing
 
04:33:49.730 --> 04:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
but also pushing them onto their
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
suppliers and their customers
 
04:33:56.209 --> 04:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
so that they classify this as class one
 
04:33:58.970 --> 04:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
class two and class three groups as they
 
04:34:01.010 --> 04:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
push starting with themselves was number
 
04:34:03.769 --> 04:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
one their suppliers is number two their
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
customer base is number three
 
04:34:08.689 --> 04:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
they're also bringing these policies
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
into the trade associations they're
 
04:34:13.849 --> 04:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
affiliated with Business Roundtable Bank
 
04:34:16.510 --> 04:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
policy Institute Financial Services form
 
04:34:19.490 --> 04:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce
 
04:34:21.769 --> 04:34:21.779 align:start position:0%
so you may ask how does this relate to
 
04:34:23.631 --> 04:34:23.641 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire Banks or New Hampshire
 
04:34:25.369 --> 04:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
Credit Unions
 
04:34:28.131 --> 04:34:28.141 align:start position:0%
well all these major banks have access
 
04:34:30.170 --> 04:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
to the Federal Reserve whenever they
 
04:34:33.289 --> 04:34:33.299 align:start position:0%
need it because of their massive size
 
04:34:35.150 --> 04:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire Banks New Hampshire
 
04:34:36.769 --> 04:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
Credit Unions
 
04:34:40.131 --> 04:34:40.141 align:start position:0%
they have access to these major Banks
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
that's their corresponding Bank
 
04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
and as Mr Moynihan said we are going to
 
04:34:50.510 --> 04:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
push these policies down into our supply
 
04:34:54.170 --> 04:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
chain and into our customers so
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
if you looked at this sheet you saw a
 
04:34:56.760 --> 04:34:58.551 align:start position:0%
if you looked at this sheet you saw a
little

04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
annotation on the far right hand side
 
04:35:04.250 --> 04:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
about having a link
 
04:35:04.260 --> 04:35:05.750 align:start position:0%
about having a link
so

04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:08.689 --> 04:35:08.699 align:start position:0%
The Net Zero banking Alliance had this
 
04:35:10.429 --> 04:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
policy of of how they're going to push
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
these policies down and all these banks
 
04:35:15.650 --> 04:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
are supposed to come up with their
 
04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
published targets of how they're going
 
04:35:20.631 --> 04:35:20.641 align:start position:0%
to implement this tasking and you see
 
04:35:22.250 --> 04:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
their target dates for when they're
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
doing it so you see some of them
 
04:35:26.570 --> 04:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
happened already last October many of
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
them happen this spring you're going to
 
04:35:31.070 --> 04:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
see the first announcements by these
 
04:35:33.769 --> 04:35:33.779 align:start position:0%
major Banks of how they're going to cram
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
these requirements down on their
 
04:35:43.849 --> 04:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.369 --> 04:35:46.379 align:start position:0%
so if you like your gas stove
 
04:35:49.670 --> 04:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
you like your gas dryer you like a gas
 
04:35:51.650 --> 04:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
or diesel car truck
 
04:35:54.109 --> 04:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
you like your firearms
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to have trouble in the
 
04:35:58.551 --> 04:35:58.561 align:start position:0%
future financing these or getting access
 
04:36:02.209 --> 04:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
to a bank that will work with you
 
04:36:05.209 --> 04:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
this bill is just very very simple it
 
04:36:07.970 --> 04:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
says we want to stick to the way we've
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
always done business there's traditional
 
04:36:12.949 --> 04:36:12.959 align:start position:0%
rules of how you conduct business how
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
you assess a creditor how you assess
 
04:36:19.010 --> 04:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
someone worthy to be a a client of your
 
04:36:20.929 --> 04:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
bank yeah we're not we're going to work
 
04:36:22.250 --> 04:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
with people that are in illegal
 
04:36:23.570 --> 04:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
businesses we're not going to work with
 
04:36:26.029 --> 04:36:26.039 align:start position:0%
people in illegal businesses we're going
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
to give loans for anyone who has the
 
04:36:31.730 --> 04:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
assets and the and the credit worthiness
 
04:36:34.310 --> 04:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
to pay them back all these are
 
04:36:36.650 --> 04:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
traditional rules of financing and we're
 
04:36:41.029 --> 04:36:41.039 align:start position:0%
not employing any other criteria d-e-i-j
 
04:36:43.970 --> 04:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
ESG or whatever kind of additional
 
04:36:46.609 --> 04:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
criteria they want to implement stick
 
04:36:48.890 --> 04:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
with the tried and true that we've lived
 
04:36:51.769 --> 04:36:51.779 align:start position:0%
with since the beginning of this country
 
04:36:54.109 --> 04:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
if banks are allowed to collectively
 
04:36:56.810 --> 04:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
decide to stop financing any group of
 
04:36:58.670 --> 04:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
people or businesses they don't like
 
04:37:01.689 --> 04:37:01.699 align:start position:0%
based on some ideological considerations
 
04:37:05.869 --> 04:37:05.879 align:start position:0%
not true Financial concerns
 
04:37:09.949 --> 04:37:09.959 align:start position:0%
then the elitist Bankers not you
 
04:37:13.551 --> 04:37:13.561 align:start position:0%
are just are are deciding not you the
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
elected representative of the peoples
 
04:37:18.170 --> 04:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
will will be deciding what's going on
 
04:37:20.810 --> 04:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
and will and they will have total
 
04:37:24.349 --> 04:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
control of our society they control all
 
04:37:25.849 --> 04:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
the money and the flow of the money
 
04:37:28.010 --> 04:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
they're controlling our society they
 
04:37:30.769 --> 04:37:30.779 align:start position:0%
don't need to pass legislation to do it
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
so I view it as the responsibility this
 
04:37:35.689 --> 04:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
legislature to be responsible to the
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
people's needs for setting public policy
 
04:37:41.570 --> 04:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
nine other states are currently acting
 
04:37:43.789 --> 04:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
on similar legislation North Dakota
 
04:37:46.131 --> 04:37:46.141 align:start position:0%
South Dakota Wyoming Montana Georgia
 
04:37:49.551 --> 04:37:49.561 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma Texas Utah and Arizona
 
04:37:51.709 --> 04:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
I would also point out
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
that if you don't believe these ESG
 
04:37:57.051 --> 04:37:57.061 align:start position:0%
criteria are being implemented then you
 
04:37:58.369 --> 04:37:58.379 align:start position:0%
have a problem with our New Hampshire
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
attorney general because he is along
 
04:38:03.289 --> 04:38:03.299 align:start position:0%
with 24 other attorney generals have
 
04:38:05.689 --> 04:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
just sued the Department of Labor over
 
04:38:10.250 --> 04:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
implementing ESG criteria in uh in our
 
04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
traditional pension fund operations
 
04:38:16.910 --> 04:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
so I strongly urge your decision to keep
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
us with traditional financing criteria
 
04:38:20.689 --> 04:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
and be happy to answer any of your
 
04:38:20.699 --> 04:38:22.369 align:start position:0%
and be happy to answer any of your
questions

04:38:22.369 --> 04:38:22.379 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:38:24.170 --> 04:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so a lot of people have
 
04:38:25.849 --> 04:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
their hand up I have a list in my head
 
04:38:27.890 --> 04:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to go representative Herbert
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent representative
 
04:38:31.670 --> 04:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
batusic representative Gibbs and then
 
04:38:33.289 --> 04:38:33.299 align:start position:0%
representative McAleer so we'll go in
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
that order
 
04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry and
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
you'll be at the end sorry I uh
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
just two questions
 
04:38:45.529 --> 04:38:45.539 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little puzzled by Net Zero
 
04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
banking why do they call themselves Net
 
04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
Zero banking I I've associate that with
 
04:38:53.449 --> 04:38:53.459 align:start position:0%
zero interest Easy Money banking but Net
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
Zero must mean something else yes that
 
04:38:59.810 --> 04:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
that Net Zero means we have no carbon by
 
04:39:03.051 --> 04:39:03.061 align:start position:0%
the year 2050 in any of our our fuel
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
usage oh okay well all right that makes
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
sense to me but uh the other question is
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
these are all private corporations now I
 
04:39:13.849 --> 04:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
understand they're powerful because of
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
their money and and their relationships
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
to governments probably
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
but I uh the thing that popped up uh to
 
04:39:25.609 --> 04:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
me was I think something like this
 
04:39:28.849 --> 04:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
occurred to break apartheid in South
 
04:39:32.750 --> 04:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
Africa in other words suddenly uh there
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
was very little money coming into South
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
Africa for the The Mining and all that
 
04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff because it was uh slave
 
04:39:42.590 --> 04:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
labor and it was racist
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
so and it worked
 
04:39:47.090 --> 04:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
even though they threw the most famous
 
04:39:50.630 --> 04:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
black leader in jail for 20 some years
 
04:39:53.810 --> 04:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
but so I understand the uh the
 
04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
relationship ESG it's all about clean
 
04:39:58.970 --> 04:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
air and
 
04:40:02.330 --> 04:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
stuff like that uh and and I I
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
understand if you're in the coal
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
business or you're Chevron or or
 
04:40:09.770 --> 04:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
otherwise that it would might put
 
04:40:11.570 --> 04:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
pressure on you because the shares are
 
04:40:14.330 --> 04:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
not getting bought and sold as as you
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
would like
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh but it's still I would be I would
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
rather have that circumstance done than
 
04:40:22.970 --> 04:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
have the government
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
start to dictate what the private sector
 
04:40:28.010 --> 04:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
can invest in that's what would you
 
04:40:31.610 --> 04:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
believe would you believe but I thanks
 
04:40:35.390 --> 04:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
for answering my Net Zero okay with
 
04:40:37.250 --> 04:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
respect to South Africa that was an
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
international essentially boycott that
 
04:40:42.890 --> 04:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
the various companies and some
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
governments uh got involved in
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
um that's not this circumstance this
 
04:40:51.530 --> 04:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
circumstance is you're having
 
04:40:53.930 --> 04:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
essentially the major
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
financial institutions and if you go to
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
that website there are it's the it's the
 
04:41:05.570 --> 04:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh Global uh uh uh Financial uh Alliance
 
04:41:09.650 --> 04:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
for Net Zero there are all six types of
 
04:41:12.650 --> 04:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
financial institutions so it's it's the
 
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh not just Banks but any of the other
 
04:41:18.650 --> 04:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
institutions the people that are
 
04:41:20.690 --> 04:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
managing our our Pension funds and
 
04:41:23.208 --> 04:41:23.218 align:start position:0%
whatnot all the groups associated with
 
04:41:27.890 --> 04:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
that BlackRock uh Vanguard State Street
 
04:41:30.650 --> 04:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
um all of them are signing on to this
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
program and saying this is how you have
 
04:41:34.670 --> 04:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
to work that's how you have to live
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
that's not appropriate all we're saying
 
04:41:40.430 --> 04:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
is if you want to do that fine as as
 
04:41:43.490 --> 04:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
your little bank but announce it ahead
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
of time and if you're not going to do
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
that then you have to follow traditional
 
04:41:48.840 --> 04:41:50.868 align:start position:0%
that then you have to follow traditional
criteria

04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
04:41:52.730 --> 04:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
all right Representatives Vincent thank
 
04:41:54.170 --> 04:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman thanks a lot
 
04:41:55.490 --> 04:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just want to
 
04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
let you know as I delivered this
 
04:41:58.610 --> 04:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
question to you it's not coming from a
 
04:42:00.050 --> 04:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
Democrat it's not coming from a
 
04:42:01.850 --> 04:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
republican right now it's a neutral
 
04:42:04.128 --> 04:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
party so I'm not picking sides either
 
04:42:06.830 --> 04:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
way so what you're trying to say well no
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about in the question about
 
04:42:10.250 --> 04:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
ready to deliver so what you're trying
 
04:42:12.350 --> 04:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
to say is these Financial uh
 
04:42:14.270 --> 04:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
institutions are trying to take over
 
04:42:17.208 --> 04:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
because maybe some Representatives
 
04:42:20.930 --> 04:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
somewhere Congress here might not like
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh they might not like the way that gun
 
04:42:27.110 --> 04:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
control is or dirty uh type of energy
 
04:42:28.850 --> 04:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
they don't you're trying to say that
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
they're actually trying to take over
 
04:42:33.288 --> 04:42:33.298 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do
 
04:42:34.610 --> 04:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
is that what you're trying to say
 
04:42:35.930 --> 04:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
because that's what it sounds like
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying yeah one of the roles of
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
ESG if you have the financial
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
institutions making all the rules that
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
everybody has to follow for all your
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
money is controlled ultimately by those
 
04:42:51.590 --> 04:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
folks your options are cut off your
 
04:42:54.470 --> 04:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
options are foreclosed yeah then they
 
04:42:57.050 --> 04:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
have made the rules and you are
 
04:42:57.060 --> 04:42:58.788 align:start position:0%
have made the rules and you are
irrelevant

04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
irrelevant
 
04:43:00.170 --> 04:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:01.628 --> 04:43:01.638 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
04:43:04.730 --> 04:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
 
04:43:07.490 --> 04:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
Bernardi isn't it true
 
04:43:11.208 --> 04:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
that MasterCard right now is tracking
 
04:43:13.970 --> 04:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
the gun dealers transactions
 
04:43:16.730 --> 04:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
therefore making a registry of gun
 
04:43:16.740 --> 04:43:18.410 align:start position:0%
therefore making a registry of gun
owners

04:43:18.410 --> 04:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
owners
 
04:43:21.770 --> 04:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
I believe they were whether they still
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
are or not because it has it has been
 
04:43:26.810 --> 04:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
challenged and it has been made public
 
04:43:29.570 --> 04:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
that this is going on and there's was a
 
04:43:31.970 --> 04:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
great concern over it so I don't know if
 
04:43:34.368 --> 04:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
they're still doing it but yes
 
04:43:37.010 --> 04:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
there have been a MasterCard was
 
04:43:39.288 --> 04:43:39.298 align:start position:0%
involved in that definitely
 
04:43:41.090 --> 04:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
all right thank you I think I said
 
04:43:43.610 --> 04:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs next
 
04:43:45.288 --> 04:43:45.298 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:45.298 --> 04:43:46.010 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:43:46.010 --> 04:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:48.170 --> 04:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
04:43:50.570 --> 04:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
if a bank in considering whether or not
 
04:43:53.170 --> 04:43:53.180 align:start position:0%
to make a loan were to take into account
 
04:43:57.410 --> 04:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
a company's record either in harming the
 
04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
environment or in avoiding harming the
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
environment that we the people all have
 
04:44:05.448 --> 04:44:05.458 align:start position:0%
to live in why would that be a bad thing
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:11.150 --> 04:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
I think that decision that's a policy
 
04:44:14.570 --> 04:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
decision that you folks should make
 
04:44:17.390 --> 04:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a policy decision the bank
 
04:44:21.410 --> 04:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
should make so if I'm if I'm uh run a
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
fuel oil company and I need to get a new
 
04:44:25.368 --> 04:44:25.378 align:start position:0%
truck and I go to the bank and say I
 
04:44:28.010 --> 04:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
want financing for my new fuel oil truck
 
04:44:29.868 --> 04:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
I don't think that bank should have the
 
04:44:31.970 --> 04:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
right to say I'm not going to give that
 
04:44:34.970 --> 04:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
loan to you I think now if you as
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
legislators say that's going to be the
 
04:44:38.750 --> 04:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
policy in New Hampshire we're going to
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
get rid of fuel oil then fine but it's
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
not it should not be the bank's decision
 
04:44:47.628 --> 04:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
to do that okay one quick one further
 
04:44:49.490 --> 04:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you
 
04:44:49.500 --> 04:44:50.628 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you
um

04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:53.330 --> 04:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that we as a
 
04:44:55.970 --> 04:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
legislature should tell private
 
04:44:58.010 --> 04:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
businesses the standards that they
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
should use in the operation of their
 
04:44:59.760 --> 04:45:00.948 align:start position:0%
should use in the operation of their
businesses

04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:45:04.730 --> 04:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
so that is you have that role within the
 
04:45:08.090 --> 04:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
limits of the Constitution
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
representative meckler
 
04:45:11.390 --> 04:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much
 
04:45:14.448 --> 04:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
um I I have an investment background and
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying that these are
 
04:45:17.868 --> 04:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
these old traditional ways of investment
 
04:45:20.030 --> 04:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
we need to stick to that ways that
 
04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
people that people invest have changed
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
all the time they're always modified I'm
 
04:45:26.810 --> 04:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
sure you're familiar with BlackRock I'm
 
04:45:29.330 --> 04:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
sure who's the CEO it's either Fink or
 
04:45:30.770 --> 04:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
zinc or whatever
 
04:45:34.128 --> 04:45:34.138 align:start position:0%
he makes a very very good case that this
 
04:45:36.830 --> 04:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
is what they're doing investing in
 
04:45:40.670 --> 04:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
companies that that have uh good ESG
 
04:45:42.830 --> 04:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
scores they're doing that for financial
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
reasons they feel that that is a better
 
04:45:48.288 --> 04:45:48.298 align:start position:0%
investment so for example let's suppose
 
04:45:51.170 --> 04:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
we've got two companies that do business
 
04:45:53.930 --> 04:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
along the Merrimack river and and one of
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
them is uh is polluting the Merrimack
 
04:45:59.150 --> 04:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
river and and both of them go to the
 
04:46:00.530 --> 04:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
bank and the bank says well wait a
 
04:46:02.570 --> 04:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
minute these guys that are polluting the
 
04:46:04.128 --> 04:46:04.138 align:start position:0%
river they're going to be in trouble
 
04:46:06.288 --> 04:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
that is not a good investment therefore
 
04:46:08.448 --> 04:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
we're not going to invest with them
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to invest with that other
 
04:46:12.410 --> 04:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
company I believe that you're presenting
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
this as this is some sort of a boogeyman
 
04:46:18.050 --> 04:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
going on here when it's not these people
 
04:46:20.930 --> 04:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
these companies are investing for
 
04:46:23.930 --> 04:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
financial reasons only and they just
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
feel that using this criteria excuse me
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.530 --> 04:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
excuse me that's a question that is a
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
question okay is is that not true that
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
they're investing for financial reasons
 
04:46:41.810 --> 04:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
so if you're using ESG scores in your
 
04:46:44.750 --> 04:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
adding those to your assessment of a A
 
04:46:48.350 --> 04:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
party's credit worthiness uh that that's
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
what uh Larry think of BlackRock wants
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:46:52.680 --> 04:46:53.628 align:start position:0%
to do
um

04:46:53.628 --> 04:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
and that's what he says he does uh
 
04:46:59.390 --> 04:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
I I will tell you that the evidence
 
04:47:02.448 --> 04:47:02.458 align:start position:0%
shows that those Investments are nine
 
04:47:04.250 --> 04:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
percent less
 
04:47:06.890 --> 04:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
worthy in their in their rate of return
 
04:47:09.708 --> 04:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
than people that use traditional
 
04:47:12.730 --> 04:47:12.740 align:start position:0%
investment strategy nine percent
 
04:47:15.708 --> 04:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
therefore it's appropriate to stick to
 
04:47:18.530 --> 04:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
traditional criteria now with respect to
 
04:47:21.650 --> 04:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
your comment about a polluter versus a
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
non-polluter okay now A Bank evaluating
 
04:47:27.230 --> 04:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
that criteria is going to say
 
04:47:29.690 --> 04:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
what is your credit worthiness and your
 
04:47:32.110 --> 04:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
ability to pay and if you are being
 
04:47:35.330 --> 04:47:35.340 align:start position:0%
violative of laws and a polluter you are
 
04:47:37.788 --> 04:47:37.798 align:start position:0%
likely to have lawsuits brought against
 
04:47:41.448 --> 04:47:41.458 align:start position:0%
you by environmental agencies and your
 
04:47:43.850 --> 04:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
credit worthiness is going to be less so
 
04:47:46.670 --> 04:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
yes indeed a bank can look at that kind
 
04:47:48.470 --> 04:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
of criteria but that's not what this is
 
04:47:50.510 --> 04:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
talking about what you said is exactly
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
my point yeah let's let's just calm down
 
04:47:54.590 --> 04:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
the room a little bit because I think
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're getting worked up uh you have
 
04:47:59.030 --> 04:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
another question representative
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh no I'll I'll leave it there thank you
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay my bill right now is dealing
 
04:48:17.690 --> 04:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
with just the banking industry I have a
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
parallel bill it deals with the
 
04:48:21.890 --> 04:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
investing Community it's not heard in
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
this committee I'm going to keep things
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
moving here uh we had uh
 
04:48:28.730 --> 04:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
who was next I can't remember
 
04:48:28.740 --> 04:48:31.970 align:start position:0%
who was next I can't remember
anyway

04:48:31.970 --> 04:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.970 --> 04:48:33.980 align:start position:0%
would you like to go representative
 
04:48:36.770 --> 04:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you my question is this do you
 
04:48:39.110 --> 04:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
feel that a private company
 
04:48:40.850 --> 04:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
um has the right to develop their own
 
04:48:42.830 --> 04:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
mission statement and their own set of
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
values which most most large
 
04:48:48.890 --> 04:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:51.170 --> 04:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
all companies have their own mission
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
statements and whatnot exactly follow up
 
04:48:56.690 --> 04:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
please follow so if that's true and
 
04:48:59.090 --> 04:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
let's say I open let's say I open a bank
 
04:49:00.890 --> 04:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
here or we open a bank here in New
 
04:49:02.570 --> 04:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and part of our value
 
04:49:04.368 --> 04:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
statement is that we are going to
 
04:49:06.288 --> 04:49:06.298 align:start position:0%
predict the environment here in New
 
04:49:06.298 --> 04:49:07.490 align:start position:0%
predict the environment here in New
Hampshire

04:49:07.490 --> 04:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:49:10.270 --> 04:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
why can't we have policies in terms of
 
04:49:14.690 --> 04:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
our our lending that reflect our our
 
04:49:17.390 --> 04:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
company values to protect that why is
 
04:49:19.010 --> 04:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
that a problem
 
04:49:21.650 --> 04:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a problem but the
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
question is how do you define protecting
 
04:49:25.730 --> 04:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
the environment and I don't and and
 
04:49:28.128 --> 04:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
there's where the the issue lies and
 
04:49:30.770 --> 04:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
that that becomes a public policy issue
 
04:49:33.890 --> 04:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
in many in in many of these cases and
 
04:49:36.368 --> 04:49:36.378 align:start position:0%
once you get to the point where
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
all the institutions I have that point
 
04:49:42.288 --> 04:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
of view and there are no other options
 
04:49:44.030 --> 04:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
available because
 
04:49:46.610 --> 04:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
as I pointed out the top six banks in
 
04:49:49.730 --> 04:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
the United States and right now 41
 
04:49:52.430 --> 04:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
percent of all the institutional capital
 
04:49:54.650 --> 04:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
in the world that's in the banking
 
04:49:57.050 --> 04:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
industry says you were going to do this
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
you are foreclosing the options for
 
04:50:03.170 --> 04:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
other opportunities
 
04:50:05.090 --> 04:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh we'll go
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative facton
 
04:50:08.990 --> 04:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative decton would you do you
 
04:50:13.368 --> 04:50:13.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.610 --> 04:50:16.620 align:start position:0%
the the problem with this that this is
 
04:50:19.490 --> 04:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
probably trying to prevent and is this
 
04:50:22.430 --> 04:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
is actually discrimination because when
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
you are lending to someone based on a
 
04:50:24.718 --> 04:50:26.470 align:start position:0%
you are lending to someone based on a
Criterion

04:50:26.470 --> 04:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
Criterion
 
04:50:29.208 --> 04:50:29.218 align:start position:0%
this is the question is am I corrected
 
04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding you are correct that
 
04:50:32.930 --> 04:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
this is a just really a discrimination
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
issue so 45 years ago I could have a
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
bank and I could say you have a really
 
04:50:40.730 --> 04:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
good job but you're a woman and so get
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
your father to sign
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
I can't do that now it's illegal what
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
you're saying right now is you're you
 
04:50:50.208 --> 04:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
have a really good job but you know a
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
really good business but I won't loan
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
you because you make ammunition you make
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
ammunition or you you deliver oil to
 
04:50:56.400 --> 04:50:57.410 align:start position:0%
ammunition or you you deliver oil to
homes

04:50:57.410 --> 04:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
homes
 
04:50:59.690 --> 04:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
so if I am I correct in that correct
 
04:51:02.270 --> 04:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you I'm going
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
to go to representative Terry because I
 
04:51:05.810 --> 04:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
think I missed your hand before and uh
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
you have a question for the witness yeah
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh there has been some discussion with
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
respect to uh dictating uh to to Banks
 
04:51:16.550 --> 04:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
what they can do and what they can't do
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
do we not already to the best of your
 
04:51:23.330 --> 04:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
knowledge already uh uh specify through
 
04:51:26.510 --> 04:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh legislation through law uh certain
 
04:51:28.128 --> 04:51:28.138 align:start position:0%
things that banks are prohibited in
 
04:51:31.390 --> 04:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
doing for example redlining
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
yes that has happened and yet that gets
 
04:51:37.730 --> 04:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
violated and it's been violated on
 
04:51:41.628 --> 04:51:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:43.850 --> 04:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:51:45.948 --> 04:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to say we have five other
 
04:51:47.690 --> 04:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
cards here so there's opportunity for
 
04:51:49.490 --> 04:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
questions in the future
 
04:51:51.770 --> 04:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
um I I think representative Sullivan you
 
04:51:52.850 --> 04:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
had your hand up do you still have a
 
04:51:52.860 --> 04:51:55.670 align:start position:0%
had your hand up do you still have a
question

04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
I'm an economist I really believe in the
 
04:52:02.330 --> 04:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
free market and so I'm trying to
 
04:52:04.490 --> 04:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
understand how this is very counter to
 
04:52:07.610 --> 04:52:07.620 align:start position:0%
the free market it seems to me if these
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
are truly bad Investments as you said or
 
04:52:11.288 --> 04:52:11.298 align:start position:0%
bad loans you said the returns are lower
 
04:52:13.970 --> 04:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
why why does the government need to be
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
involved here I mean is what's stopping
 
04:52:17.690 --> 04:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
another bank from coming in and be like
 
04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
we will focus on these issues that are
 
04:52:20.810 --> 04:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
being ignored there'll be a great
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity for it it seems like it
 
04:52:23.990 --> 04:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this is something the
 
04:52:27.170 --> 04:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
flea market can handle and it's the ESG
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
strategy is bad then another bank should
 
04:52:32.510 --> 04:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
be able to fill in that spot but I'm I'm
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
I generally get uncomfortable when the
 
04:52:35.868 --> 04:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
government tries to throw mandates down
 
04:52:38.090 --> 04:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
on people whether it's
 
04:52:40.610 --> 04:52:40.620 align:start position:0%
good intentioned or not sometimes uh it
 
04:52:42.050 --> 04:52:42.060 align:start position:0%
leads to some
 
04:52:44.930 --> 04:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
concerning outcomes
 
04:52:48.590 --> 04:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
I I understand and appreciate your uh
 
04:52:51.708 --> 04:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
your consideration I'm also free market
 
04:52:56.570 --> 04:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
oriented the the concern is that this
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
movement is so large and so overwhelming
 
04:53:01.970 --> 04:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
that those other institutions are going
 
04:53:07.128 --> 04:53:07.138 align:start position:0%
to be crowded out unless we say You must
 
04:53:11.090 --> 04:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
stick with traditional criteria
 
04:53:11.100 --> 04:53:12.590 align:start position:0%
stick with traditional criteria
follow

04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:53:15.650 --> 04:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate that and I that's a
 
04:53:19.730 --> 04:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
perspective I I I'm curious if uh you
 
04:53:21.650 --> 04:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
have faith that despite the size we've
 
04:53:24.350 --> 04:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
seen is there is it basically is there
 
04:53:25.550 --> 04:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
an argument here that there's like this
 
04:53:27.410 --> 04:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
is almost like a collusion and so
 
04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
therefore the government's warranted
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm thinking I'm thinking like
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
Microsoft when the government sued
 
04:53:34.910 --> 04:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
Microsoft was that legitimate or did we
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
just let you know Apple come along and
 
04:53:38.330 --> 04:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
disrupt the market the way they did well
 
04:53:40.610 --> 04:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
the collusion argument is relevant there
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
are many attorney generals which are
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
currently bringing suit against ESG
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
movement for collusion okay thank you
 
04:53:50.650 --> 04:53:50.660 align:start position:0%
ongoing effort representative spear
 
04:53:54.110 --> 04:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
we've been talking you've been talking
 
04:53:59.090 --> 04:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
about Investments at with coal companies
 
04:54:00.890 --> 04:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
and gas companies and all that sort of
 
04:54:03.650 --> 04:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
thing the law talks about individual
 
04:54:03.660 --> 04:54:05.990 align:start position:0%
thing the law talks about individual
people

04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:54:08.208 --> 04:54:08.218 align:start position:0%
what are we dealing with here are we
 
04:54:10.128 --> 04:54:10.138 align:start position:0%
dealing with trying to stop Banks from
 
04:54:12.770 --> 04:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
investing in specific non-coal companies
 
04:54:14.690 --> 04:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
are we talking about some private
 
04:54:17.208 --> 04:54:17.218 align:start position:0%
citizen going into a bank and getting a
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
home mortgage
 
04:54:22.490 --> 04:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
well this bank is focused on banking
 
04:54:25.250 --> 04:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
activities in New Hampshire and so it
 
04:54:27.410 --> 04:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that well it's a New
 
04:54:30.288 --> 04:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA so it's without talking
 
04:54:34.910 --> 04:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.850 --> 04:54:37.860 align:start position:0%

Texas wants to come to New Hampshire for
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
a loan I I suppose they could I don't
 
04:54:46.430 --> 04:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
think they would uh but uh the the point
 
04:54:49.250 --> 04:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
is more directly relevant to what you're
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
talking about if you if you are looking
 
04:54:53.570 --> 04:54:53.580 align:start position:0%

04:55:20.458 --> 04:55:21.470 align:start position:0%
representative McLeary again further
question

04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
um are you familiar with that case in
 
04:55:27.170 --> 04:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
Texas where a county refused to do
 
04:55:31.128 --> 04:55:31.138 align:start position:0%
businesses with uh banks that were using
 
04:55:31.138 --> 04:55:35.330 align:start position:0%
businesses with uh banks that were using
ESG

04:55:35.330 --> 04:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:38.448 --> 04:55:38.458 align:start position:0%
no right sorry well just to clarify what
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
what happened is they ended up having to
 
04:55:43.250 --> 04:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
pay billions of dollars more because
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
they refused to do a business with some
 
04:55:47.330 --> 04:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
of these banks that were employing an
 
04:55:51.590 --> 04:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
ESG method of financing thank you
 
04:55:53.150 --> 04:55:53.160 align:start position:0%

04:55:56.448 --> 04:55:56.458 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking all those
 
04:55:58.990 --> 04:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
um I think we we really
 
04:56:04.208 --> 04:56:04.218 align:start position:0%

uh I have um
 
04:56:10.010 --> 04:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
the the Attorney General's office uh
 
04:56:12.288 --> 04:56:12.298 align:start position:0%
Mary Stewart and they have a neutral
 
04:56:14.448 --> 04:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
position on the bill
 
04:56:20.690 --> 04:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Mary Stewart from the Attorney
 
04:56:24.350 --> 04:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
General's office consumer protection
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
Division and we are new we do have a
 
04:56:28.730 --> 04:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
neutral position regarding this bill I
 
04:56:31.070 --> 04:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
only have a comment on one provision
 
04:56:34.810 --> 04:56:34.820 align:start position:0%
which is uh number two Roman numeral
 
04:56:38.208 --> 04:56:38.218 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two which states that any
 
04:56:40.128 --> 04:56:40.138 align:start position:0%
financial institution who violates
 
04:56:43.128 --> 04:56:43.138 align:start position:0%
paragraph one shall be guilty of an
 
04:56:45.770 --> 04:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
unfair and deceptive business practice
 
04:56:50.090 --> 04:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
under RSA 358 A2 which is our consumer
 
04:56:53.628 --> 04:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
protection statute and I think as most
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
of you are familiar that
 
04:56:55.680 --> 04:56:56.410 align:start position:0%
of you are familiar that
um

04:56:56.410 --> 04:56:56.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
this statue deals exclusively with the
 
04:57:03.230 --> 04:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
acts of financial institutions and
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
financial institutions are exempt under
 
04:57:08.510 --> 04:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire consumer protection
 
04:57:10.448 --> 04:57:10.458 align:start position:0%
act so to the extent this bill
 
04:57:12.770 --> 04:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
anticipates the Attorney General would
 
04:57:15.948 --> 04:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
enforce we do not have any authority to
 
04:57:16.970 --> 04:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
as it's written and that's all I have
 
04:57:23.930 --> 04:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
okay questions
 
04:57:25.250 --> 04:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative spear do you have a
 
04:57:27.110 --> 04:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
question I just didn't hear the last
 
04:57:29.690 --> 04:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
sentence that you said so to the extent
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
that this bill anticipates the Attorney
 
04:57:35.570 --> 04:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
General would enforce the statute we do
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question I am a sponsor but
 
04:57:43.190 --> 04:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
I this is a clarifying question is there
 
04:57:45.250 --> 04:57:45.260 align:start position:0%
talking through my mouth
 
04:57:48.890 --> 04:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
is there a similar provision in the
 
04:57:51.410 --> 04:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
statutes that govern your Authority that
 
04:57:56.448 --> 04:57:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:58.250 --> 04:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
um unfair or deceptive business
 
04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
practices there are similar provision in
 
04:58:02.330 --> 04:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
the statues like this so the bank
 
04:58:05.750 --> 04:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner regulates and the acts of
 
04:58:08.208 --> 04:58:08.218 align:start position:0%
financial institutions and they have
 
04:58:10.610 --> 04:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
their own statute and I believe they are
 
04:58:13.970 --> 04:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
also going to be testifying today
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:21.490 --> 04:58:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
and next we'll call Christy Merrill of
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh the bankers Association
 
04:58:41.050 --> 04:58:41.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:44.090 --> 04:58:44.100 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chair
 
04:58:45.170 --> 04:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
um and honorable members of the House
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee my name is Christy
 
04:58:48.410 --> 04:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
Merrill I'm president of the New
 
04:58:50.448 --> 04:58:50.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bankers Association and with
 
04:58:52.610 --> 04:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
me today is Ryan Hale vice president of
 
04:58:54.650 --> 04:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bankers Association
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
um we represent 38 member banks and they
 
04:58:59.330 --> 04:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
employ roughly 6 000 employees in the
 
04:59:01.070 --> 04:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
state and we're here today in strong
 
04:59:04.010 --> 04:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 227.
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
the intent of House Bill 227 appears to
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
prohibit Banks from engaging in
 
04:59:10.970 --> 04:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practices when providing
 
04:59:12.770 --> 04:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
Financial Services
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
we agree with the sponsor the bank
 
04:59:16.670 --> 04:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
should not discriminate and we're
 
04:59:18.230 --> 04:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
extremely concerned however that the
 
04:59:20.090 --> 04:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
legislation of this nature will invite
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuits ultimately resulting
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
in increased lending costs which will be
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
felt by consumers at a time when
 
04:59:28.730 --> 04:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
interest rates are rising
 
04:59:31.070 --> 04:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
the bill uses vague and undefined terms
 
04:59:33.530 --> 04:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
such as ordinary business practices and
 
04:59:35.930 --> 04:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
objective Financial standards which will
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
subject Banks to increase scrutiny
 
04:59:40.550 --> 04:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
anytime they turn someone away this then
 
04:59:42.890 --> 04:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
places the burden on the bank to prove
 
04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
that the decision was made for ordinary
 
04:59:47.208 --> 04:59:47.218 align:start position:0%
business purposes
 
04:59:49.550 --> 04:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
out of fear of litigation Banks could be
 
04:59:51.410 --> 04:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
put in a position of approving loans
 
04:59:53.930 --> 04:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
that they otherwise wouldn't resulting
 
04:59:56.448 --> 04:59:56.458 align:start position:0%
in riskier loans poor credit quality
 
04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
increased litigation and even more
 
05:00:01.128 --> 05:00:01.138 align:start position:0%
regulatory burdens ultimately it will
 
05:00:04.850 --> 05:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
encross increase the cost of Lending
 
05:00:07.368 --> 05:00:07.378 align:start position:0%
additionally banks have in-house
 
05:00:09.230 --> 05:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
expertise for certain sectors of the
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
economy in order to make safe and sound
 
05:00:14.690 --> 05:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
and under in order to safely and soundly
 
05:00:17.208 --> 05:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
underwrite loans under this proposal
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
Banks would again be forced to make
 
05:00:21.890 --> 05:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
riskier loans due to a lack of expertise
 
05:00:23.390 --> 05:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
out of fear of being accused of
 
05:00:25.610 --> 05:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
discrimination not only will the subject
 
05:00:27.230 --> 05:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
the bank to litigation but it would put
 
05:00:29.448 --> 05:00:29.458 align:start position:0%
the bank in a difficult situation with
 
05:00:31.010 --> 05:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
their Regulators since they are
 
05:00:32.868 --> 05:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
regularly examined on safety and
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
soundness and I just want to emphasize
 
05:00:37.850 --> 05:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
that point here on expertise so for
 
05:00:40.128 --> 05:00:40.138 align:start position:0%
example we have a new member bank that
 
05:00:42.110 --> 05:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
they specialize in agricultural loans
 
05:00:46.190 --> 05:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
and so for example if a company in the
 
05:00:48.170 --> 05:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry went before them
 
05:00:50.090 --> 05:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
and said we'd like to work with you and
 
05:00:51.410 --> 05:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
they said you know we really don't have
 
05:00:53.390 --> 05:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
the expertise you know we focus on
 
05:00:55.490 --> 05:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
agriculture under this legislation they
 
05:00:57.890 --> 05:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
would be forced to work with that other
 
05:00:59.868 --> 05:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
type of client even though they don't
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do so and they
 
05:01:03.650 --> 05:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
choose not to do so
 
05:01:06.110 --> 05:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
um basically this legislation turns the
 
05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
idea of fair lending on its head
 
05:01:11.150 --> 05:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
the general rule has always been that a
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
bank or other private company is free to
 
05:01:15.410 --> 05:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
do business with the customers it
 
05:01:17.690 --> 05:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
chooses as long as that choice doesn't
 
05:01:20.510 --> 05:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly disadvantage a
 
05:01:23.930 --> 05:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
protected class such as race gender Etc
 
05:01:26.090 --> 05:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
this law says there is no longer a
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
choice only if a person meets objective
 
05:01:30.530 --> 05:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
Financial standards established in
 
05:01:32.868 --> 05:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
advance which is not defined can a
 
05:01:35.390 --> 05:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
person's request be denied
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
if ever if every instance a banking
 
05:01:39.470 --> 05:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
customer is told no for particular
 
05:01:41.628 --> 05:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
Financial Service and it's going to be
 
05:01:43.070 --> 05:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
subject to scrutiny under New Hampshire
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
law it will create a tremendous burden
 
05:01:47.510 --> 05:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
on financial institutions which could
 
05:01:49.730 --> 05:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
impact decisions to do business in the
 
05:01:52.250 --> 05:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
state is this really the culture that
 
05:01:54.170 --> 05:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
policy makers want to cultivate for the
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
granite state so in looking at this
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
legislation we did share this with our
 
05:02:00.530 --> 05:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
members and wanted to get some real
 
05:02:02.150 --> 05:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
examples for you as to why this
 
05:02:03.948 --> 05:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
legislation wouldn't work and so I have
 
05:02:05.810 --> 05:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
just a few that I want to share with you
 
05:02:08.410 --> 05:02:08.420 align:start position:0%
the first is regarding employee safety
 
05:02:12.350 --> 05:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
so right now today if um if if a
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
customer comes in and they're making
 
05:02:16.128 --> 05:02:16.138 align:start position:0%
threatening remarks to staff the bank
 
05:02:17.930 --> 05:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
has the right to choose to not to do
 
05:02:20.030 --> 05:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
business with that customer in order to
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
protect their employees in order to have
 
05:02:23.330 --> 05:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
a certain culture that they want to
 
05:02:25.910 --> 05:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
maintain and that could be true if
 
05:02:28.970 --> 05:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
someone was if they were a racist if
 
05:02:30.110 --> 05:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
they were all sorts of these negative
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
things under this proposal you know they
 
05:02:34.970 --> 05:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
might think twice about choosing not to
 
05:02:37.490 --> 05:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
do business with them out of fear of
 
05:02:39.650 --> 05:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
discriminatory accusations
 
05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
another example that was shared with us
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
is it's not clear if it takes into
 
05:02:46.910 --> 05:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
consideration persons who have
 
05:02:48.288 --> 05:02:48.298 align:start position:0%
mishandled their Accounts at previous
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
institutions so today what happens is
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
most banks report charge-offs what's
 
05:02:55.368 --> 05:02:55.378 align:start position:0%
known as charge-offs for accounts that
 
05:02:57.530 --> 05:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
have been closed with deficit balances
 
05:03:00.770 --> 05:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
the new bank is then informed of unpaid
 
05:03:03.050 --> 05:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
deficit balances but this language
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
requires the banks would still have to
 
05:03:07.788 --> 05:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
allow that person to open the account
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
so that's an issue that I'd want to
 
05:03:11.448 --> 05:03:11.458 align:start position:0%
raise with you all and then another
 
05:03:13.250 --> 05:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
point I just want to make is just you
 
05:03:14.510 --> 05:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
know we all know that there are
 
05:03:16.670 --> 05:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
disgruntled customers and if a customer
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
is unhappy with a bank and they go out
 
05:03:19.910 --> 05:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
in the community and they're
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
bad-mouthing the institution under this
 
05:03:23.448 --> 05:03:23.458 align:start position:0%
law they would still be forced to
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
continue to provide them services
 
05:03:28.368 --> 05:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
in addition to those examples you know
 
05:03:30.288 --> 05:03:30.298 align:start position:0%
we we believe this bill is unnecessary
 
05:03:32.810 --> 05:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
because banks are already subjected to
 
05:03:35.448 --> 05:03:35.458 align:start position:0%
extensive regulation above and beyond
 
05:03:37.010 --> 05:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
the laws which protect against
 
05:03:39.288 --> 05:03:39.298 align:start position:0%
discrimination so this is a long list
 
05:03:41.090 --> 05:03:41.100 align:start position:0%
but I think it's relative to the
 
05:03:42.770 --> 05:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
discussion today so I just want to list
 
05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
these these are all federal
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations that touch on
 
05:03:50.150 --> 05:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination that Banks adhere to and
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
that that includes the community
 
05:03:53.868 --> 05:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
reinvestment act the Fair Credit
 
05:03:56.690 --> 05:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
Reporting Act Equal Credit Opportunity
 
05:03:59.690 --> 05:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
Act the Fair Housing Act Equal Pay Act
 
05:04:02.270 --> 05:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights Act Americans with
 
05:04:04.730 --> 05:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
Disabilities Act and age discrimination
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
and Employment Act
 
05:04:09.350 --> 05:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
additionally it appears that house bill
 
05:04:12.110 --> 05:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
227 runs a foul of both the state and
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
the Federal Constitution
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
specifically in singling out Banks the
 
05:04:18.350 --> 05:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
bill infringes on A bank's
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to free speech
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
stripping away its ability to make its
 
05:04:25.150 --> 05:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
own Independent Business decisions
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
likewise the bill deprives Banks of
 
05:04:29.930 --> 05:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
equal protections of the laws single out
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
banks in a manner that is specific to
 
05:04:34.010 --> 05:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
only banks to our knowledge no other
 
05:04:36.288 --> 05:04:36.298 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire is subjected
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
to such intrusive government controls
 
05:04:41.208 --> 05:04:41.218 align:start position:0%
simply put if enacted this bill would
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
deprive Banks of fundamental
 
05:04:45.530 --> 05:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional freedoms in a manner that
 
05:04:47.990 --> 05:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
is unprecedented in our state
 
05:04:50.208 --> 05:04:50.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economy is rightly the
 
05:04:52.010 --> 05:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
Envy of most and banks are proud to be
 
05:04:54.050 --> 05:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
part of that success and they take great
 
05:04:56.330 --> 05:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
care in reviewing loan applications and
 
05:04:58.910 --> 05:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
deposit accounts every year Our member
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
banks support our communities by lending
 
05:05:02.570 --> 05:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars to New
 
05:05:04.850 --> 05:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses and Families
 
05:05:06.770 --> 05:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
however household 227 will be
 
05:05:07.730 --> 05:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
devastating to our New Hampshire
 
05:05:10.190 --> 05:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
advantage and tie up Granite State Banks
 
05:05:12.650 --> 05:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
and endless red tape and litigation
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
and this is a fundamental change in our
 
05:05:16.368 --> 05:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
approach for our Live Free or Die state
 
05:05:18.288 --> 05:05:18.298 align:start position:0%
which has historically sought to keep
 
05:05:20.390 --> 05:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
businesses and individuals free from
 
05:05:22.250 --> 05:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
unnecessary regulation
 
05:05:24.350 --> 05:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
while we have seen Banks continue to
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
move here from other states so this
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
legislation could have a chilling effect
 
05:05:28.610 --> 05:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
on that growth
 
05:05:30.230 --> 05:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Banks oppose
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination as should all businesses
 
05:05:34.250 --> 05:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
and countless state and federal laws
 
05:05:35.868 --> 05:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
already govern our conduct to ensure
 
05:05:38.270 --> 05:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
fairness and transparency this
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
legislation is unnecessary and unworted
 
05:05:42.170 --> 05:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
proposal that would pose serious and
 
05:05:43.970 --> 05:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
negative consequences for all banks and
 
05:05:45.770 --> 05:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
we would um recommend inexpediate to
 
05:05:48.590 --> 05:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you
 
05:05:52.368 --> 05:05:52.378 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Ryan Mr Hill do you
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
have anything to add
 
05:05:54.000 --> 05:05:54.890 align:start position:0%
have anything to add
um

05:05:54.890 --> 05:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:57.830 --> 05:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
and could you submit a pink card yes I
 
05:05:59.448 --> 05:05:59.458 align:start position:0%
absolutely will thank you
 
05:06:01.610 --> 05:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
um yeah and we heard some comments about
 
05:06:03.410 --> 05:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
the free market
 
05:06:06.350 --> 05:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh the use of ESG and if you look
 
05:06:09.770 --> 05:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
if you Google on um Vanguard last
 
05:06:09.780 --> 05:06:11.810 align:start position:0%
if you Google on um Vanguard last
December

05:06:11.810 --> 05:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
December
 
05:06:13.788 --> 05:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
um broke away from the Net Zero uh
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
because of the backlash they saw
 
05:06:18.050 --> 05:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
um on this front so
 
05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I can share with the committee an
 
05:06:19.920 --> 05:06:20.868 align:start position:0%
um I can share with the committee an
article

05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
article
 
05:06:23.090 --> 05:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
um that was posted in December about
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
that so good
 
05:06:28.010 --> 05:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
thank you and questions
 
05:06:30.230 --> 05:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
oh and you have written testimony if you
 
05:06:31.310 --> 05:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
just give it to the course we do have
 
05:06:32.930 --> 05:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
written test that would be great I'm
 
05:06:34.250 --> 05:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
just going to pick randomly okay uh
 
05:06:36.470 --> 05:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan thank you you
 
05:06:38.690 --> 05:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
just sort of touched on it uh obviously
 
05:06:39.948 --> 05:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
the question that you heard me ask about
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
the free market was
 
05:06:44.030 --> 05:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
the pre-market should take care of it
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
sounds like you maybe have an example of
 
05:06:47.150 --> 05:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
it I'd like you to maybe expand on that
 
05:06:47.160 --> 05:06:48.410 align:start position:0%
it I'd like you to maybe expand on that
because

05:06:48.410 --> 05:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:06:50.208 --> 05:06:50.218 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor's argument is that
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's a potential for a lot of
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
collusion going on which could really
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
stifle business that's the Crux of his
 
05:06:57.650 --> 05:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
argument was I took it so uh maybe you
 
05:06:59.448 --> 05:06:59.458 align:start position:0%
could expand on that is that something
 
05:07:00.890 --> 05:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
you're seeing or are you seeing other
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
examples like this Vanguard one which
 
05:07:04.250 --> 05:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
sounds interesting where the free market
 
05:07:06.350 --> 05:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
seems to be doing its job
 
05:07:09.050 --> 05:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you I don't have um I
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
just I think in response to the question
 
05:07:10.680 --> 05:07:11.930 align:start position:0%
just I think in response to the question
about

05:07:11.930 --> 05:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:07:13.970 --> 05:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
um if there's collusion going on
 
05:07:16.670 --> 05:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
um you know we have a lot of confidence
 
05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
in the free market and
 
05:07:19.798 --> 05:07:20.448 align:start position:0%
in the free market and
um

05:07:20.448 --> 05:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:23.208 --> 05:07:23.218 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it is the case that
 
05:07:25.490 --> 05:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel the fossil fuel industry is
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
not getting lending
 
05:07:29.570 --> 05:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
um I do think that certain businesses
 
05:07:31.970 --> 05:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
have their own set of mission and values
 
05:07:34.430 --> 05:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
that may not align with that but I think
 
05:07:36.530 --> 05:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
in our capitalist Society if one
 
05:07:39.170 --> 05:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
institution says you know we don't want
 
05:07:41.690 --> 05:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
to work with a fossil fuel company my
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
guess is there is another bank right
 
05:07:44.330 --> 05:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
around the corner they'll be more than
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
happy to take their money so I know that
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
for some folks ESG is not popular but I
 
05:07:56.270 --> 05:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
would simply say that customers always
 
05:07:58.070 --> 05:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
have the right to vote with their feet
 
05:08:01.550 --> 05:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
and so if a customer does not approve of
 
05:08:03.368 --> 05:08:03.378 align:start position:0%
their financial institutions Mission
 
05:08:06.288 --> 05:08:06.298 align:start position:0%
values their investment strategies they
 
05:08:07.670 --> 05:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
always have the ability to take their
 
05:08:10.250 --> 05:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
funds and go someplace else and so we're
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
happy about you know the the environment
 
05:08:13.368 --> 05:08:13.378 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have a competitive
 
05:08:16.250 --> 05:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
Marketplace for the banking industry and
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
we do think that this bill May harm that
 
05:08:20.208 --> 05:08:20.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Terry yes thank
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
you uh so we heard testimony uh and you
 
05:08:27.230 --> 05:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
were present to hear this I believe
 
05:08:30.050 --> 05:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh that the six major banks in the
 
05:08:32.448 --> 05:08:32.458 align:start position:0%
United States have signed on to the U.N
 
05:08:34.730 --> 05:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
environment program Finance initiative
 
05:08:37.550 --> 05:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
which I understood to effectively mean
 
05:08:40.070 --> 05:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
that they are adopting
 
05:08:43.970 --> 05:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
um ESG policies and and goals
 
05:08:46.368 --> 05:08:46.378 align:start position:0%
uh can you tell us
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
because you represent your member banks
 
05:08:51.708 --> 05:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire if any um have
 
05:08:53.150 --> 05:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
been approached
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
of to sign on to the initiative have any
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
signed on
 
05:09:01.490 --> 05:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
and do any and the third part of the
 
05:09:04.490 --> 05:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
question is do any of your member banks
 
05:09:07.490 --> 05:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh have they adopted any sort of ESG
 
05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
policies in Lending
 
05:09:13.670 --> 05:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
um so I did I did not get a copy of that
 
05:09:16.430 --> 05:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
I did hear that testimony
 
05:09:18.410 --> 05:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm not an expert on this
 
05:09:21.230 --> 05:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
Net Zero Global initiative of the six
 
05:09:22.910 --> 05:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
Banks just going for my memory I think I
 
05:09:25.310 --> 05:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
wrote them down but um Bank of America
 
05:09:26.810 --> 05:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
they are a member of New Hampshire
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
Bankers JPMorgan Chase they have a
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
presence in New Hampshire they're a
 
05:09:33.410 --> 05:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
member Wells Fargo we help them on some
 
05:09:34.970 --> 05:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
legislative work they are not a member
 
05:09:36.530 --> 05:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
but they do have a mortgage presence not
 
05:09:39.948 --> 05:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
no banks here in the state with a branch
 
05:09:42.410 --> 05:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
um I can't tell speak to whether or not
 
05:09:44.090 --> 05:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
they have been approached what they've
 
05:09:46.250 --> 05:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
signed on I can I can only see the
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
information that has been presented I
 
05:09:50.810 --> 05:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
can tell you they are members whether or
 
05:09:54.170 --> 05:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
not they are using ESG you know some of
 
05:09:57.170 --> 05:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
our members are B Corps some of our
 
05:10:00.288 --> 05:10:00.298 align:start position:0%
members do Embrace ESG some of the
 
05:10:02.930 --> 05:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
Regulators encourage the banks to be
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
supportive of ESG what I can tell you is
 
05:10:08.270 --> 05:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
based on previous legislation last year
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
when there was talk about social credit
 
05:10:13.250 --> 05:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
scores and ESG scoring we asked our
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
members are you using ESG and social
 
05:10:18.050 --> 05:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
credit scores for Lending in your Banks
 
05:10:20.510 --> 05:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
and they told us no and we didn't know
 
05:10:22.730 --> 05:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
what that was frankly until the bill was
 
05:10:25.310 --> 05:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
introduced last year so that's the best
 
05:10:28.850 --> 05:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:32.448 --> 05:10:32.458 align:start position:0%
so um the six banks have all established
 
05:10:34.610 --> 05:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
targets which have either passed or are
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
coming due in the near future you do
 
05:10:39.190 --> 05:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
have member banks here in New Hampshire
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
which whose parent corporations are
 
05:10:45.230 --> 05:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
the Bank of America at the very least
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember the other
 
05:10:51.050 --> 05:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh Morgan Stanley JP Morgan City so you
 
05:10:54.530 --> 05:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
do have members but at this time you are
 
05:10:59.330 --> 05:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
not aware of any of the uh member banks
 
05:11:02.330 --> 05:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire members of these one or
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
more of these six largest banks in the
 
05:11:07.788 --> 05:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
United States who are who have adopted
 
05:11:11.090 --> 05:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
and are applying ESG policies and scores
 
05:11:13.730 --> 05:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
with respect to lending here in New
 
05:11:13.740 --> 05:11:14.708 align:start position:0%
with respect to lending here in New
Hampshire

05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
ESG scoring um definitely not we are not
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
aware of that ESG policies as I said
 
05:11:23.510 --> 05:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
some have adopted ESG policies we are
 
05:11:25.490 --> 05:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
not aware of any of our members using
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
ESG policies in their lending practices
 
05:11:29.628 --> 05:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:32.510 --> 05:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gibbs I think is next
 
05:11:36.050 --> 05:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I just wanted to ask if uh
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
you could send your written testimony to
 
05:11:44.288 --> 05:11:44.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:46.810 --> 05:11:46.820 align:start position:0%
yeah we can do that thank you
 
05:11:49.070 --> 05:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
05:11:52.128 --> 05:11:52.138 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um so when representative
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh Bernardi was doing his testimony he
 
05:11:57.110 --> 05:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
said that some of the smaller banks in
 
05:12:00.110 --> 05:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
our state need to access
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
these Banks and my understanding of how
 
05:12:03.708 --> 05:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
it works is that all banks have access
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
to the Federal Reserve but is that not
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
the case am I wrong with that like does
 
05:12:08.868 --> 05:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
a small Bank maybe have to partner with
 
05:12:10.430 --> 05:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
Bank of America to get Capital so
 
05:12:12.050 --> 05:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
therefore would be potentially exposed
 
05:12:15.110 --> 05:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
to various ESG programs so my
 
05:12:16.550 --> 05:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is the same as yours all
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
banks have access to the Federal Reserve
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
through a master account which they can
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
apply for regarding small Banks and
 
05:12:26.270 --> 05:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
relying on the big Banks the only thing
 
05:12:29.208 --> 05:12:29.218 align:start position:0%
that I uh that I'm aware of that a small
 
05:12:32.750 --> 05:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
Bank may do is they may partner out with
 
05:12:34.850 --> 05:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
another institution on a loan if they
 
05:12:36.410 --> 05:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
need if they don't have enough Capital
 
05:12:38.330 --> 05:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
to to work with a particular customer
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
they may participate alone with another
 
05:12:43.368 --> 05:12:43.378 align:start position:0%
institution but not aware of anything in
 
05:12:45.288 --> 05:12:45.298 align:start position:0%
a few words so potentially there's a
 
05:12:45.298 --> 05:12:46.910 align:start position:0%
a few words so potentially there's a
theoretical

05:12:46.910 --> 05:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
theoretical
 
05:12:49.430 --> 05:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
ability for Bank of America to enforce
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
it on a smaller Bank through that
 
05:12:53.150 --> 05:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
channel that's like but it seems very
 
05:12:55.490 --> 05:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
unlikely okay thank you
 
05:12:57.230 --> 05:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent thank you Mr
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't the BET don't the banks have the
 
05:13:03.650 --> 05:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
right to deny without any explanation to
 
05:13:03.660 --> 05:13:06.708 align:start position:0%
right to deny without any explanation to
anybody

05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:08.930 --> 05:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm not sure by your use of
 
05:13:10.368 --> 05:13:10.378 align:start position:0%
the word right I don't know if they have
 
05:13:11.330 --> 05:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
a right
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
um they don't
 
05:13:15.410 --> 05:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
do not by law obligated to say hey we're
 
05:13:18.110 --> 05:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
denying you for this reason or are they
 
05:13:20.510 --> 05:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
I mean Banks they have customers just
 
05:13:22.310 --> 05:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
like Bank just like any other company
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
has customers and they can choose not to
 
05:13:25.610 --> 05:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
work with them for some of the reasons I
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
said right so if there's a a customer
 
05:13:29.990 --> 05:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
that is insulting and puts their
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
employee safety at risk they can say no
 
05:13:34.610 --> 05:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
um you know if someone if a bank chooses
 
05:13:36.650 --> 05:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
chooses not to give someone a loan my
 
05:13:37.850 --> 05:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that customer can
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
say hey why didn't I get the loan they
 
05:13:42.770 --> 05:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
can ask that that question but um I'm
 
05:13:43.910 --> 05:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
not sure if that answers your question
 
05:13:45.708 --> 05:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:13:48.050 --> 05:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
a little set
 
05:13:51.590 --> 05:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
05:13:58.330 --> 05:13:58.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:03.730 --> 05:14:03.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you Commissioners normally
 
05:14:14.208 --> 05:14:14.218 align:start position:0%

don't criticize money
 
05:14:22.208 --> 05:14:22.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:24.770 --> 05:14:24.780 align:start position:0%

um so we are neutral have no position
 
05:14:36.890 --> 05:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
with regard to the underlying policy
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
considerations that have been discussed
 
05:14:41.690 --> 05:14:41.700 align:start position:0%
in terms of political issues
 
05:14:43.070 --> 05:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
um however
 
05:14:44.930 --> 05:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
um we would take the position that this
 
05:14:47.868 --> 05:14:47.878 align:start position:0%
bill is practically speaking probably
 
05:14:50.690 --> 05:14:50.700 align:start position:0%
likely unenforceable as drafted due to
 
05:14:52.910 --> 05:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
the numerous technical defects with it
 
05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
or technical issues so or alternatively
 
05:14:59.570 --> 05:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't really practically speaking
 
05:15:01.250 --> 05:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that have been
 
05:15:03.890 --> 05:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
brought out before the committee
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
um so first I would say that all of the
 
05:15:10.368 --> 05:15:10.378 align:start position:0%
banks that were listed specifically in
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
testimony prior to now are not under the
 
05:15:13.788 --> 05:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the New Hampshire
 
05:15:16.368 --> 05:15:16.378 align:start position:0%
banking Department we regulate state
 
05:15:18.410 --> 05:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
chart Banks state chart Credit Unions
 
05:15:21.288 --> 05:15:21.298 align:start position:0%
state chart trust companies for example
 
05:15:24.530 --> 05:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
we don't regulate nationally charred
 
05:15:26.448 --> 05:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
Banks they wouldn't
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
have to comply with this law this law
 
05:15:31.730 --> 05:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
falls under RSA 383-a which is under our
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so
 
05:15:36.110 --> 05:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's issue number one the second issue
 
05:15:38.390 --> 05:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
is we don't have we have not received
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
any evidence that any of the
 
05:15:42.000 --> 05:15:42.708 align:start position:0%
any evidence that any of the
um

05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:46.368 --> 05:15:46.378 align:start position:0%
issues described to date
 
05:15:48.830 --> 05:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
or that seem to be addressed by the
 
05:15:50.510 --> 05:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
Plain language of the statute are
 
05:15:51.948 --> 05:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
occurring we have not received any
 
05:15:54.350 --> 05:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
complaints from consumers saying that
 
05:15:56.150 --> 05:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
they were being denied
 
05:15:58.910 --> 05:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
access to banking services for any of
 
05:16:01.070 --> 05:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
the reasons that have been described
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
before the committee to date
 
05:16:04.080 --> 05:16:04.610 align:start position:0%
before the committee to date
um

05:16:04.610 --> 05:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:08.750 --> 05:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
further the language of this bill is
 
05:16:11.030 --> 05:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
you it uses a lot of unclear terminology
 
05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
to be candid so it talks about
 
05:16:18.830 --> 05:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
seemingly credit denials so there are
 
05:16:20.330 --> 05:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
there's a whole
 
05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
um slew of federal laws that govern
 
05:16:27.230 --> 05:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh when somebody has to be that when
 
05:16:29.510 --> 05:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's denied credit they have to be
 
05:16:31.310 --> 05:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
notified and there's disclosure rules
 
05:16:33.708 --> 05:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
about that so this would seem to in
 
05:16:35.690 --> 05:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
places directly conflict with those
 
05:16:37.730 --> 05:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
federal laws and rules
 
05:16:40.430 --> 05:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I and in cases where state laws
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
conflict with federal laws the federal
 
05:16:46.250 --> 05:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
rules uh carried the day so
 
05:16:48.110 --> 05:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
um those are just some of the technical
 
05:16:48.120 --> 05:16:49.430 align:start position:0%
um those are just some of the technical
issues

05:16:49.430 --> 05:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:16:52.368 --> 05:16:52.378 align:start position:0%
um to the extent we we don't have any
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
evidence that
 
05:16:57.110 --> 05:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
State chartered banks are running
 
05:16:59.810 --> 05:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
the ESG scores I think that have been
 
05:16:59.820 --> 05:17:01.250 align:start position:0%
the ESG scores I think that have been
discussed

05:17:01.250 --> 05:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
um I think we did some research into
 
05:17:05.150 --> 05:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
that last year and our research tended
 
05:17:08.570 --> 05:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
to indicate that if somebody was pulling
 
05:17:12.288 --> 05:17:12.298 align:start position:0%
an ESG score from some entity that
 
05:17:15.530 --> 05:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
creates ESG scores that that would have
 
05:17:18.288 --> 05:17:18.298 align:start position:0%
to be disclosed to the consumer so if a
 
05:17:19.970 --> 05:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
consumer was being subject or credit
 
05:17:22.490 --> 05:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
decisions were being made based on that
 
05:17:25.310 --> 05:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
score the consumer would know about it
 
05:17:28.010 --> 05:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
and we would have likely heard about it
 
05:17:28.020 --> 05:17:29.810 align:start position:0%
and we would have likely heard about it
um

05:17:29.810 --> 05:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:33.530 --> 05:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
so that's that um further just from a
 
05:17:35.390 --> 05:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
practical standpoint
 
05:17:35.400 --> 05:17:36.230 align:start position:0%
practical standpoint
um

05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:38.570 --> 05:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
we would likely see an increase in
 
05:17:40.910 --> 05:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints I would imagine as a
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
result of this law
 
05:17:44.750 --> 05:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
and they would be very difficult and
 
05:17:47.690 --> 05:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
time consuming for us to investigate and
 
05:17:49.730 --> 05:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
would also increase correspondingly
 
05:17:51.470 --> 05:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
increase the burden on the entity that's
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
complained about because our complaint
 
05:17:54.410 --> 05:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
process is when we get a complaint we
 
05:17:56.570 --> 05:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
have to run it to ground so we would be
 
05:17:59.448 --> 05:17:59.458 align:start position:0%
requiring The Entity complained about to
 
05:18:01.128 --> 05:18:01.138 align:start position:0%
respond to us
 
05:18:03.708 --> 05:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
um we didn't get a fiscal note worksheet
 
05:18:05.330 --> 05:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
request for this one I don't believe
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's a there's no physical note
 
05:18:08.990 --> 05:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
associated with this
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
um but it would likely have some
 
05:18:13.310 --> 05:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
physical impact on the banking
 
05:18:13.320 --> 05:18:14.750 align:start position:0%
physical impact on the banking
Department

05:18:14.750 --> 05:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
Department
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the entities that we
 
05:18:17.040 --> 05:18:18.650 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the entities that we
regulate

05:18:18.650 --> 05:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
05:18:18.660 --> 05:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
regulate
um

05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:22.010 --> 05:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
finally at the end the violation
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
language about the consumer protection
 
05:18:26.868 --> 05:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
act so we do have our own unfair and
 
05:18:28.368 --> 05:18:28.378 align:start position:0%
deceptive acts and practices that are
 
05:18:30.770 --> 05:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
governed by the banking department and
 
05:18:32.628 --> 05:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
um I would recommend that if this was
 
05:18:33.770 --> 05:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
something you wanted the banking
 
05:18:36.410 --> 05:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
Department to enforce that it
 
05:18:38.990 --> 05:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
referenced those laws basically
 
05:18:39.000 --> 05:18:39.948 align:start position:0%
referenced those laws basically
um

05:18:39.948 --> 05:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:43.250 --> 05:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
and didn't miss anything okay
 
05:18:44.990 --> 05:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
um so we're happy to answer any
 
05:18:45.000 --> 05:18:45.948 align:start position:0%
um so we're happy to answer any
questions

05:18:45.948 --> 05:18:45.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:18:50.030 --> 05:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:18:53.470 --> 05:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh chair will call him representative
 
05:18:55.680 --> 05:18:57.170 align:start position:0%
uh chair will call him representative
sellers

05:18:57.170 --> 05:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
sellers
 
05:19:06.170 --> 05:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:09.288 --> 05:19:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:11.868 --> 05:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair committee again and I
 
05:19:13.850 --> 05:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
apologize last time I never introduced
 
05:19:15.948 --> 05:19:15.958 align:start position:0%
myself representative sellers Grafton 18
 
05:19:18.890 --> 05:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
I represent 10 southern towns in Grafton
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
approximately 17
 
05:19:23.868 --> 05:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
000 residents I got the flutorial
 
05:19:23.878 --> 05:19:25.670 align:start position:0%
000 residents I got the flutorial
anyways

05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
05:19:25.680 --> 05:19:26.810 align:start position:0%
anyways
um

05:19:26.810 --> 05:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:29.288 --> 05:19:29.298 align:start position:0%
one thing I like about this law it's
 
05:19:32.208 --> 05:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
proactive instead of being reactive
 
05:19:35.570 --> 05:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
and no law is going to be perfect coming
 
05:19:38.030 --> 05:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
out the door so you may have to tweak it
 
05:19:40.430 --> 05:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
if it's next year the year after but we
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
get something on the books I it will
 
05:19:45.770 --> 05:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
protect the citizens of New Hampshire
 
05:19:47.510 --> 05:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
and one thing that we all do we all do
 
05:19:47.520 --> 05:19:48.708 align:start position:0%
and one thing that we all do we all do
banking

05:19:48.708 --> 05:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
banking
 
05:19:51.288 --> 05:19:51.298 align:start position:0%
we all do it and we need it and let's go
 
05:19:53.390 --> 05:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
back that goes back to the previous uh
 
05:19:56.930 --> 05:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
build 225 where we're trying to keep
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
privacy and that's where crypto comes in
 
05:20:01.970 --> 05:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
as well because you can do when you go
 
05:20:03.708 --> 05:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
to back to crypto you can do direct
 
05:20:05.690 --> 05:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
transactions you don't you skip the
 
05:20:08.270 --> 05:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
banks all together so therefore
 
05:20:09.708 --> 05:20:09.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:20:12.288 --> 05:20:12.298 align:start position:0%
the banks do have the power just like
 
05:20:13.788 --> 05:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
the company I used to work for over a
 
05:20:16.128 --> 05:20:16.138 align:start position:0%
year ago they came down after 20 years
 
05:20:18.470 --> 05:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
working there they said show me your
 
05:20:21.410 --> 05:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
papers that you've been vaccinated or
 
05:20:23.330 --> 05:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
you're terminated
 
05:20:26.390 --> 05:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
all right a four billion dollar company
 
05:20:28.250 --> 05:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
said this to me after 20 years of
 
05:20:30.770 --> 05:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
working for them all right now it was my
 
05:20:32.930 --> 05:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
right to either show the papers or not
 
05:20:36.830 --> 05:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
my point is big businesses have big
 
05:20:40.070 --> 05:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
power over one simple individual like
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
any one of us here so I believe this
 
05:20:45.470 --> 05:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill is actually being proactive will it
 
05:20:47.690 --> 05:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
need an amendment or tweaked
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
yes maybe so but at least start getting
 
05:20:53.510 --> 05:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
it in front of getting in front instead
 
05:20:55.730 --> 05:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
of behind because the last thing we want
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
to do is not be able to go to the bank
 
05:21:00.410 --> 05:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
and buy our next house at that point
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
there's no way I have 500 000 sitting in
 
05:21:05.690 --> 05:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
my sitting uh sitting at my house right
 
05:21:07.610 --> 05:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
now to say okay I'll buy that house and
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
cash here we go I have to go through the
 
05:21:11.750 --> 05:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
bank and what happens if that bank also
 
05:21:13.970 --> 05:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
goes and says well you know what that
 
05:21:15.708 --> 05:21:15.718 align:start position:0%
next house has a
 
05:21:19.128 --> 05:21:19.138 align:start position:0%
um oil furnace and we don't want to
 
05:21:20.990 --> 05:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
really finance that or maybe we're going
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
to charge you an extra 0.1 percent
 
05:21:24.890 --> 05:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
interest and you know who's going to
 
05:21:26.510 --> 05:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
really know if they charge me a little
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
bit more interest or not from financing
 
05:21:30.770 --> 05:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
that house there's a lot of unknowns we
 
05:21:32.810 --> 05:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
know we don't know so what my point is
 
05:21:34.730 --> 05:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
on this whole thing is I believe this
 
05:21:37.368 --> 05:21:37.378 align:start position:0%
bill is actually proactive so
 
05:21:39.948 --> 05:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
thank you great fair enough
 
05:21:43.250 --> 05:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan yeah I'm just
 
05:21:45.410 --> 05:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
gonna close the same question I asked Mr
 
05:21:46.910 --> 05:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
Bernardi which is
 
05:21:48.770 --> 05:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
if you if you believe in the free market
 
05:21:52.250 --> 05:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
which I do why is this bill needed
 
05:21:54.948 --> 05:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
so again that you know there's no way I
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't like to put mandates on anybody
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
and you're right we're putting mandates
 
05:21:59.930 --> 05:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
on a business which is an entity it's
 
05:22:02.570 --> 05:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
not a citizen it's an entity but Banks
 
05:22:05.208 --> 05:22:05.218 align:start position:0%
and also entities put mandates on us all
 
05:22:07.430 --> 05:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
the time so I don't see anything wrong
 
05:22:08.448 --> 05:22:08.458 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
follow up for the question me and Claire
 
05:22:10.798 --> 05:22:11.930 align:start position:0%
follow up for the question me and Claire
so

05:22:11.930 --> 05:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:14.090 --> 05:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
I think I read and it might be the bank
 
05:22:16.128 --> 05:22:16.138 align:start position:0%
that the not the banking commission but
 
05:22:18.050 --> 05:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
the lobbyist for the bank people uh just
 
05:22:20.090 --> 05:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
talked about which is there is a bank I
 
05:22:21.550 --> 05:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
think that is just targeting
 
05:22:25.128 --> 05:22:25.138 align:start position:0%
agricultural industry now so like are
 
05:22:27.530 --> 05:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
you saying that the free market does not
 
05:22:29.270 --> 05:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
would not work in this case and so
 
05:22:30.948 --> 05:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
therefore we can't have maybe a bank
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
that specializes in homes that only have
 
05:22:35.208 --> 05:22:35.218 align:start position:0%
oil furnaces if they think that's a
 
05:22:37.070 --> 05:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
great business decision or in this
 
05:22:38.930 --> 05:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
example agriculture I mean it seems to
 
05:22:40.850 --> 05:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
me the free market can find their little
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
niches in Banks and and I I'm struggling
 
05:22:47.810 --> 05:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
to understand why this is needed so I go
 
05:22:49.788 --> 05:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
back to the point of
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
will the bill will this bill need some
 
05:22:54.410 --> 05:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
tweaking maybe so all right this might
 
05:22:56.810 --> 05:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
not be perfect but it's a start
 
05:23:00.230 --> 05:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:02.570 --> 05:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay we're all set thank you very much
 
05:23:03.708 --> 05:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
05:23:06.470 --> 05:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh I have Glenn Perlo from the New
 
05:23:14.270 --> 05:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:16.970 --> 05:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh
 
05:23:18.590 --> 05:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
people have preceded me have said
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
everything that I would want to say so
 
05:23:22.610 --> 05:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be fairly brief um I did
 
05:23:24.770 --> 05:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
send in some written testimony uh last
 
05:23:27.230 --> 05:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
evening I do have copies here if anyone
 
05:23:29.208 --> 05:23:29.218 align:start position:0%
would like to review them
 
05:23:29.218 --> 05:23:30.110 align:start position:0%
would like to review them
um

05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:32.570 --> 05:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's important uh I didn't have a chance
 
05:23:35.330 --> 05:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago to introduce myself so
 
05:23:37.010 --> 05:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know who the trust
 
05:23:40.190 --> 05:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
council is uh the chair knows very well
 
05:23:42.288 --> 05:23:42.298 align:start position:0%
because he's been involved in sort of
 
05:23:43.910 --> 05:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
this Venture of modernizing New
 
05:23:45.948 --> 05:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's trust industry and growing
 
05:23:45.958 --> 05:23:46.788 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's trust industry and growing
it

05:23:46.788 --> 05:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:23:49.128 --> 05:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
um over now two decades
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
um so I'm president of trust Council and
 
05:23:52.970 --> 05:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
I also serve as general counsel and
 
05:23:54.650 --> 05:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
chief administrative officer of Jordan
 
05:23:57.288 --> 05:23:57.298 align:start position:0%
Park Trust Company
 
05:23:57.298 --> 05:23:58.128 align:start position:0%
Park Trust Company
um

05:23:58.128 --> 05:23:58.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:00.650 --> 05:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
you should know if you don't that
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
non-depository trust companies are State
 
05:24:08.150 --> 05:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
Banks and while I love State Banks and
 
05:24:09.770 --> 05:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
have lots of experience with them and
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
support everything that they have told
 
05:24:14.448 --> 05:24:14.458 align:start position:0%
you because it all applies to the trust
 
05:24:17.030 --> 05:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
companies as well I have to say that by
 
05:24:19.610 --> 05:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
law we are not allowed to take deposits
 
05:24:22.250 --> 05:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
and accept in very limited circumstances
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
make loans so the kind of overarching uh
 
05:24:29.090 --> 05:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
political issues or ideological issues
 
05:24:31.128 --> 05:24:31.138 align:start position:0%
going on are
 
05:24:34.010 --> 05:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
um uh uh we're kind of not really in
 
05:24:37.010 --> 05:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
that fight however uh bad bills can
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
often sweep in many unintended
 
05:24:41.930 --> 05:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
consequences here
 
05:24:43.610 --> 05:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
pardon the pun but literally our
 
05:24:46.010 --> 05:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
business is built on trust many of us
 
05:24:49.550 --> 05:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
have small selected groups of clients we
 
05:24:51.708 --> 05:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
are in many ways more akin to choosing a
 
05:24:55.368 --> 05:24:55.378 align:start position:0%
lawyer or a doctor or a dentist and so I
 
05:24:56.890 --> 05:24:56.900 align:start position:0%
need to make that distinction because
 
05:24:59.750 --> 05:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
the very way that we develop
 
05:25:01.730 --> 05:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
relationships with our clients and
 
05:25:03.948 --> 05:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
develop a mutual desire to work together
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
with clients would seem to violate the
 
05:25:10.330 --> 05:25:10.340 align:start position:0%
ambiguous language in this bill
 
05:25:14.330 --> 05:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
regarding non-financial decision making
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I would want to
 
05:25:20.270 --> 05:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
emphasize is reputational risk is a real
 
05:25:21.890 --> 05:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
thing the bank commissioner could tell
 
05:25:24.770 --> 05:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
you and her team that when we are
 
05:25:26.090 --> 05:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
determining whether we'll work with
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
somebody it's incredibly important
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
important for us to uh to mind that and
 
05:25:33.770 --> 05:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
be careful with whom we do business
 
05:25:37.128 --> 05:25:37.138 align:start position:0%
because our other clients
 
05:25:39.288 --> 05:25:39.298 align:start position:0%
um can be affected reputationally and
 
05:25:41.390 --> 05:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately we can be affected
 
05:25:43.250 --> 05:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
reputationally and that's a huge thing
 
05:25:45.470 --> 05:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
in the financial services sector because
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
you all and citizens want to trust us
 
05:25:53.208 --> 05:25:53.218 align:start position:0%
and so uh I have detailed our concerns
 
05:25:56.570 --> 05:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
with constitutional infirmities here the
 
05:25:58.550 --> 05:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
only thing I'll interject in that regard
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
is it seems ironic if there is concern
 
05:26:02.280 --> 05:26:03.850 align:start position:0%
is it seems ironic if there is concern
about

05:26:03.850 --> 05:26:03.860 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:26:06.110 --> 05:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
larger forces
 
05:26:09.050 --> 05:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh creating lack of opportunity or
 
05:26:12.288 --> 05:26:12.298 align:start position:0%
cramming uh their view down that the
 
05:26:14.448 --> 05:26:14.458 align:start position:0%
solution would be the government telling
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
private businesses how to do their
 
05:26:19.788 --> 05:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
business outside of the sensible laws
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
that apply to us equally as depository
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.270 --> 05:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
05:26:32.510 --> 05:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh one card left uh Lily Tang
 
05:26:32.520 --> 05:26:33.948 align:start position:0%

05:26:55.010 --> 05:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
I do feel the pain of the industry
 
05:26:57.170 --> 05:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
banking industry is very heavily
 
05:27:01.448 --> 05:27:01.458 align:start position:0%
regulated already but we all support
 
05:27:01.458 --> 05:27:03.170 align:start position:0%
regulated already but we all support
anti-discrimination

05:27:03.170 --> 05:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination
 
05:27:05.230 --> 05:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
you cannot
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
discriminate anybody will go to your
 
05:27:10.250 --> 05:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
bank either business owners or private
 
05:27:12.288 --> 05:27:12.298 align:start position:0%
individual to say I want to get a bank
 
05:27:15.170 --> 05:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
loan but I'm denied because I'm not in
 
05:27:18.350 --> 05:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
the right industry because my political
 
05:27:20.930 --> 05:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
beliefs because I did not buy into
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
United Nation or whatever climate change
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
agenda I mean the wrong industry oil gas
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
and fossil fuel there are a lot of
 
05:27:30.948 --> 05:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
things that it's already in the law so
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
you cannot discriminate people plus as
 
05:27:36.410 --> 05:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
somebody who come here
 
05:27:39.050 --> 05:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
to believe in our U.S Constitution
 
05:27:39.060 --> 05:27:40.910 align:start position:0%
to believe in our U.S Constitution
people

05:27:40.910 --> 05:27:40.920 align:start position:0%

05:27:44.810 --> 05:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
are entitled to protection of private
 
05:27:44.820 --> 05:27:46.490 align:start position:0%

when I look at you know they also that
 
05:27:52.970 --> 05:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
when you talk about ESG
 
05:27:56.270 --> 05:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's a very potentially dangerous
 
05:27:59.868 --> 05:27:59.878 align:start position:0%
it's already been pushed down on us
 
05:28:02.448 --> 05:28:02.458 align:start position:0%
you know ESG you'll know it's
 
05:28:05.390 --> 05:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
environmental social governance
 
05:28:05.400 --> 05:28:07.430 align:start position:0%
environmental social governance
and

05:28:07.430 --> 05:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
two major Global rating agencies include
 
05:28:14.990 --> 05:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
the SP 500 they use ESG to read all
 
05:28:17.628 --> 05:28:17.638 align:start position:0%
financial markets and capital investment
 
05:28:21.170 --> 05:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
markets so if you are a red State like
 
05:28:24.590 --> 05:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
Utah West Virginia because they are
 
05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
heavy in oil and gas Industries so their
 
05:28:29.810 --> 05:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
rating is low
 
05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
even though there have lots of cash in
 
05:28:34.610 --> 05:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
terms of mass and money they're great
 
05:28:38.030 --> 05:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
but they cannot get a higher rate in
 
05:28:40.490 --> 05:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
that affect how much cash investment
 
05:28:42.650 --> 05:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
they're going to get in our in their
 
05:28:45.470 --> 05:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
state maybe some will affect us in our
 
05:28:45.480 --> 05:28:46.368 align:start position:0%
state maybe some will affect us in our
state

05:28:46.368 --> 05:28:46.378 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
you know why because they have a power
 
05:28:52.850 --> 05:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
and how are we going to help protect
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
people even though I understand you say
 
05:28:57.050 --> 05:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
oh free market you need a free market to
 
05:29:00.250 --> 05:29:00.260 align:start position:0%
work but discrimination
 
05:29:03.170 --> 05:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination is a government as a
 
05:29:03.180 --> 05:29:04.010 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination is a government as a
job

05:29:04.010 --> 05:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:29:07.128 --> 05:29:07.138 align:start position:0%
I have seen social credit scores tied to
 
05:29:10.250 --> 05:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
ESG related scoring in China
 
05:29:12.770 --> 05:29:12.780 align:start position:0%
based on your political beliefs you
 
05:29:15.410 --> 05:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
cannot go to even School you cannot get
 
05:29:17.868 --> 05:29:17.878 align:start position:0%
a bank loan to buy a house you cannot
 
05:29:19.910 --> 05:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
get a business loan to finance your
 
05:29:19.920 --> 05:29:21.708 align:start position:0%
get a business loan to finance your
startup

05:29:21.708 --> 05:29:21.718 align:start position:0%
startup
 
05:29:24.770 --> 05:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
and why are we talking about ESG
 
05:29:28.128 --> 05:29:28.138 align:start position:0%
something even similar to China's social
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
security system if they can use that to
 
05:29:32.690 --> 05:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
regulate what kind of business
 
05:29:36.590 --> 05:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
Industries is going to get along it will
 
05:29:39.288 --> 05:29:39.298 align:start position:0%
happen to our private citizens sooner
 
05:29:42.250 --> 05:29:42.260 align:start position:0%
than you think we're gonna based on you
 
05:29:44.448 --> 05:29:44.458 align:start position:0%
political beliefs
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
to decide if you are worthy to get loans
 
05:29:52.610 --> 05:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
or not it's very dangerous I agree this
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill can be improved there are some
 
05:29:57.410 --> 05:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
models and there's also lawsuit for All
 
05:30:00.410 --> 05:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
State Traders about 30 States getting
 
05:30:04.970 --> 05:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
together to sue some of those on reading
 
05:30:07.010 --> 05:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
companies to say you're putting us in
 
05:30:10.190 --> 05:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
this Advantage situation because we're
 
05:30:13.070 --> 05:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
not you know in the right industry so
 
05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
maybe this is the beginning point we can
 
05:30:18.110 --> 05:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
discuss the issue we can talk about ESG
 
05:30:20.868 --> 05:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
the more people talk about it the more
 
05:30:23.208 --> 05:30:23.218 align:start position:0%
small business owners and bankers aware
 
05:30:24.410 --> 05:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
of it
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
and the more you know then we want to
 
05:30:29.628 --> 05:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
feel like we need to do something to
 
05:30:33.170 --> 05:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
protect people's rights you know to free
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
speech is really come down to
 
05:30:38.150 --> 05:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
business owners private property rights
 
05:30:40.250 --> 05:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
they are entitled to get along has
 
05:30:41.570 --> 05:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with their political
 
05:30:44.030 --> 05:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
belief no matter with this realism or
 
05:30:47.628 --> 05:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
not but also eventually then it's going
 
05:30:50.990 --> 05:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
to regulate private citizens and so
 
05:30:52.910 --> 05:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's just something come out of
 
05:30:55.070 --> 05:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
my chest when I look at this bill to say
 
05:30:57.708 --> 05:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
you know in principle are supported but
 
05:31:00.890 --> 05:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
it can be improved thank you very much
 
05:31:03.170 --> 05:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:31:05.810 --> 05:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
see no questions thank you very much
 
05:31:08.150 --> 05:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
oh my testimonies no question I would
 
05:31:09.770 --> 05:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
love to have more questions about it
 
05:31:11.930 --> 05:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your time today
 
05:31:11.940 --> 05:31:13.730 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your time today
okay

05:31:13.730 --> 05:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:15.470 --> 05:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
all right so that's it so we'll close
 
05:31:17.628 --> 05:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it was a blue sheet or
 
05:31:21.890 --> 05:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
not but okay we have one more Bill left
 
05:31:21.900 --> 05:31:25.730 align:start position:0%
not but okay we have one more Bill left
584.

05:31:25.730 --> 05:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
keep the dude do a card
 
05:31:31.010 --> 05:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
don't you can do it you can do it on the
 
05:31:33.050 --> 05:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
way back you can do it
 
05:31:33.060 --> 05:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
way back you can do it
foreign

05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:38.090 --> 05:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
don't worry about it
 
05:31:40.250 --> 05:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
we'll get you later we know where to
 
05:31:46.610 --> 05:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:48.470 --> 05:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
I know we're running behind so I'm going
 
05:31:51.890 --> 05:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
to keep my testimony fairly short but I
 
05:31:54.170 --> 05:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
just want to say uh first time on this
 
05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
side of the room and I didn't realize
 
05:32:00.670 --> 05:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:03.530 --> 05:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
Lottery will get you everywhere
 
05:32:06.650 --> 05:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:08.570 --> 05:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
so for those of us that were on the this
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee last term uh we dealt with a
 
05:32:14.510 --> 05:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill it was House Bill 1503
 
05:32:14.520 --> 05:32:15.110 align:start position:0%
bill it was House Bill 1503
um

05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:18.350 --> 05:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
and uh the The Genius of the committee
 
05:32:20.930 --> 05:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
and and I'll give credit to the chairman
 
05:32:22.910 --> 05:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
05:32:27.230 --> 05:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
um there was an idea to adopt
 
05:32:30.110 --> 05:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
a new article from the uniform law
 
05:32:33.050 --> 05:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
commission and uh the uniform law
 
05:32:36.050 --> 05:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
commission is almost I think 100 years
 
05:32:38.570 --> 05:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
old institution it's headquartered out
 
05:32:40.250 --> 05:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
of Chicago
 
05:32:44.090 --> 05:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
and its goal is to make uh
 
05:32:47.208 --> 05:32:47.218 align:start position:0%
Commercial Code uniform between the
 
05:32:47.218 --> 05:32:48.110 align:start position:0%
Commercial Code uniform between the
states

05:32:48.110 --> 05:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:32:50.930 --> 05:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
so a lot of uh commercial activity is
 
05:32:53.390 --> 05:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
regulated by the states and to
 
05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
facilitate interstate commerce it helps
 
05:32:59.030 --> 05:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
if the states have similar or the same
 
05:32:59.040 --> 05:33:00.288 align:start position:0%
if the states have similar or the same
statutes

05:33:00.288 --> 05:33:00.298 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
05:33:02.750 --> 05:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of our statutes and a lot
 
05:33:04.250 --> 05:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
of the statutes this committee deals
 
05:33:04.260 --> 05:33:04.970 align:start position:0%
of the statutes this committee deals
with

05:33:04.970 --> 05:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:33:07.910 --> 05:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
our Uniform Commercial Code from the you
 
05:33:11.090 --> 05:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
know the the universal law Commission
 
05:33:14.208 --> 05:33:14.218 align:start position:0%
and so when we discussed digital assets
 
05:33:17.270 --> 05:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
and that's a very big topic it includes
 
05:33:18.670 --> 05:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
lots of things
 
05:33:21.530 --> 05:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
but think about it this way
 
05:33:24.410 --> 05:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
um in the past you could have a a
 
05:33:26.270 --> 05:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
contract written
 
05:33:29.208 --> 05:33:29.218 align:start position:0%
on a piece of paper and that people
 
05:33:32.208 --> 05:33:32.218 align:start position:0%
would sign that contract and that
 
05:33:34.610 --> 05:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
contract would either prove
 
05:33:39.730 --> 05:33:39.740 align:start position:0%
agreement in a contract a mutual uh a
 
05:33:42.110 --> 05:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
services for payment or something like
 
05:33:43.910 --> 05:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
that or it could prove ownership like a
 
05:33:45.410 --> 05:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
deed to a house
 
05:33:47.930 --> 05:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
and so in our digital world that piece
 
05:33:50.330 --> 05:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
of paper has become code that lives in
 
05:33:50.340 --> 05:33:51.110 align:start position:0%
of paper has become code that lives in
the

05:33:51.110 --> 05:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:33:53.448 --> 05:33:53.458 align:start position:0%
lives in a data structure somewhere on
 
05:33:55.730 --> 05:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
the internet and the physical signature
 
05:33:58.250 --> 05:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
is no longer a pen and paper but it's uh
 
05:33:58.260 --> 05:33:59.510 align:start position:0%
is no longer a pen and paper but it's uh
become

05:33:59.510 --> 05:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
become
 
05:34:03.590 --> 05:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh cryptographic uh key that only you
 
05:34:06.050 --> 05:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
own so a cryptographic key think about
 
05:34:08.030 --> 05:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
it like a very very big password that's
 
05:34:09.530 --> 05:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
impossible to guess so we're all
 
05:34:11.030 --> 05:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with passwords but this is a
 
05:34:12.190 --> 05:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
really big password
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
and that instead of your signature on a
 
05:34:16.128 --> 05:34:16.138 align:start position:0%
piece of paper
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
that is your digital uh fingerprint
 
05:34:22.670 --> 05:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
almost and so
 
05:34:26.330 --> 05:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
the uniform law commission uh had a
 
05:34:29.930 --> 05:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
draft that was almost complete it was in
 
05:34:31.850 --> 05:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
the final stages they took I think over
 
05:34:33.770 --> 05:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
two years developing it with this large
 
05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
committee you can go online and look at
 
05:34:37.550 --> 05:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
all their meeting minutes and see the
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
the um the process that was involved and
 
05:34:46.128 --> 05:34:46.138 align:start position:0%
uh we got a permission they waived us
 
05:34:47.750 --> 05:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
and said it was okay if we were the
 
05:34:49.670 --> 05:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
first state to adopt it and we went a
 
05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
little bit early
 
05:34:51.120 --> 05:34:51.770 align:start position:0%
little bit early
um

05:34:51.770 --> 05:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:55.010 --> 05:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
and we uh in the bill there was a
 
05:34:58.490 --> 05:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
provision uh to report on changes that
 
05:35:00.110 --> 05:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
we would have to update so that's what
 
05:35:02.150 --> 05:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is 584
 
05:35:04.850 --> 05:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
this is a minor uh
 
05:35:06.890 --> 05:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
it's minor in the sense that it's a lot
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
of jot and tittles
 
05:35:12.110 --> 05:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
but it does cover quite a few pages and
 
05:35:13.970 --> 05:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
these are the final edits the red line
 
05:35:17.510 --> 05:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
edits to article 12 that deals with
 
05:35:19.070 --> 05:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
digital assets
 
05:35:22.850 --> 05:35:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh and why is this important uh for one
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
this is one of the recommendations that
 
05:35:26.090 --> 05:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
came out of the governor's
 
05:35:28.310 --> 05:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency digital asset commission
 
05:35:30.110 --> 05:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
was that we should keep up with changes
 
05:35:31.610 --> 05:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
in the UCC and that it was a good thing
 
05:35:33.050 --> 05:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
that we adopted it
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh because it gives us rules of the road
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
a very Baseline set of rules
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it has to deal with custody
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
of digital assets so if I hand you a
 
05:35:46.250 --> 05:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
piece of paper you can put it in a and I
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
say hold on to this and keep it safe you
 
05:35:50.030 --> 05:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
can put it in a filing cabinet but if
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's a digital asset and I say hold on
 
05:35:54.350 --> 05:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
to this and keep it safe there's a whole
 
05:35:56.330 --> 05:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
set of rules and computer security
 
05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
around uh custodying that asset and
 
05:36:02.868 --> 05:36:02.878 align:start position:0%
because these digital assets are
 
05:36:05.930 --> 05:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
becoming very valuable and an
 
05:36:07.970 --> 05:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
increasingly larger part of our economy
 
05:36:11.208 --> 05:36:11.218 align:start position:0%
it's important that there's rules around
 
05:36:13.368 --> 05:36:13.378 align:start position:0%
you know one of the advantages of a
 
05:36:15.410 --> 05:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
digital asset is you can self-custody it
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
so you can put it like like you would
 
05:36:19.070 --> 05:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
put cash under a mattress there is a way
 
05:36:22.010 --> 05:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
for you to self-custody that digital
 
05:36:24.550 --> 05:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
asset but a lot of people don't feel
 
05:36:26.990 --> 05:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
Savvy at computer savvy enough to do
 
05:36:28.850 --> 05:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
that or they're they worry about the
 
05:36:30.708 --> 05:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
long term you know keeping it so that
 
05:36:32.270 --> 05:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
they could pass it on to their children
 
05:36:33.970 --> 05:36:33.980 align:start position:0%
and their grandchildren that kind of
 
05:36:36.470 --> 05:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
intergenerational wealth that people
 
05:36:38.990 --> 05:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
want to build and so that they hand over
 
05:36:42.230 --> 05:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
the custody to a third party to keep it
 
05:36:43.910 --> 05:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
safe for them and that's what these
 
05:36:46.910 --> 05:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
rules are generally about is uh who has
 
05:36:50.330 --> 05:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
control of the asset and uh what are the
 
05:36:52.368 --> 05:36:52.378 align:start position:0%
some of the basic guidelines for custing
 
05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
the asset and you'll notice the uniform
 
05:36:56.868 --> 05:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
law commission they didn't use the term
 
05:36:59.690 --> 05:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency digital asset nft or any
 
05:37:01.310 --> 05:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
of these other fancy terms that we're
 
05:37:04.250 --> 05:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
hearing they came up with a very generic
 
05:37:07.128 --> 05:37:07.138 align:start position:0%
term called controllable electronic
 
05:37:09.650 --> 05:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
records so when you see controllable
 
05:37:11.590 --> 05:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
electronic record you think about
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
instead of a piece of paper it's
 
05:37:15.170 --> 05:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
computer code and instead of a physical
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
signature it's a digital signature and
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
that uh someone can take control over
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
that digital record hand off that
 
05:37:26.948 --> 05:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
control to someone else
 
05:37:29.030 --> 05:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what these rules and
 
05:37:31.730 --> 05:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
guidelines are about and this bill is
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
just cleaning up
 
05:37:36.110 --> 05:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
the final draft that we had passed last
 
05:37:39.230 --> 05:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
term and making it their
 
05:37:42.050 --> 05:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh their current version of article 12.
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that
 
05:37:46.010 --> 05:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
explains what we're doing here and I'm
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
05:37:47.760 --> 05:37:50.930 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
representative

05:37:50.930 --> 05:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
05:37:53.868 --> 05:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
we take my question who did you work
 
05:37:55.850 --> 05:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
with um
 
05:37:58.730 --> 05:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
what groups did you work with to
 
05:38:00.530 --> 05:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
work on this bill so it's the uniform
 
05:38:02.330 --> 05:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
law commission I believe there's someone
 
05:38:04.430 --> 05:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
here from the uniform law commission
 
05:38:06.350 --> 05:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to testify and they'll have
 
05:38:06.360 --> 05:38:07.910 align:start position:0%
that's going to testify and they'll have
in-depth

05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
in-depth
 
05:38:10.310 --> 05:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
more more in-depth knowledge about the
 
05:38:12.850 --> 05:38:12.860 align:start position:0%
details so it you can go to uniform
 
05:38:15.650 --> 05:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
walls.org you can search for the
 
05:38:18.230 --> 05:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
commission that drafted this article and
 
05:38:19.730 --> 05:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
you can look through all their minutes
 
05:38:22.010 --> 05:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
and all the conversations they had about
 
05:38:23.930 --> 05:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
tweaking it and changing it what about
 
05:38:26.150 --> 05:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
this what about that and this is the
 
05:38:29.208 --> 05:38:29.218 align:start position:0%
final Redline version between what we
 
05:38:30.890 --> 05:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
passed last year and the current state
 
05:38:34.490 --> 05:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:37.670 --> 05:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay Representative Vincent thank you
 
05:38:39.050 --> 05:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
Miss chairman thanks for taking my
 
05:38:42.170 --> 05:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
question so this is going to be transfer
 
05:38:45.170 --> 05:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
of any electrical or any elect any type
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
of electronic
 
05:38:50.448 --> 05:38:50.458 align:start position:0%
what like could it be Bitcoin transfers
 
05:38:50.458 --> 05:38:51.350 align:start position:0%
what like could it be Bitcoin transfers
too

05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:38:53.090 --> 05:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
yeah it could be that's exactly what it
 
05:38:56.270 --> 05:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
is right well it's it's so the the term
 
05:38:59.050 --> 05:38:59.060 align:start position:0%
that they use I guess it's a term of art
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
controllable electronic records it could
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
Encompass a lot of different things and
 
05:39:05.868 --> 05:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
including Bitcoin
 
05:39:05.878 --> 05:39:07.550 align:start position:0%
including Bitcoin
is

05:39:07.550 --> 05:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:39:11.410 --> 05:39:11.420 align:start position:0%
it could it could Encompass
 
05:39:14.810 --> 05:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
because uh we've been having problems
 
05:39:16.850 --> 05:39:16.860 align:start position:0%
with Bitcoin because we dropped our
 
05:39:20.330 --> 05:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
wallet so to speak and it's lost and
 
05:39:21.530 --> 05:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
that's going to be able to recover that
 
05:39:24.410 --> 05:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
correct correct thank you very much
 
05:39:27.170 --> 05:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
and just just to follow up on that a lot
 
05:39:28.490 --> 05:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
of people worry about losing their
 
05:39:30.050 --> 05:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
wallet and losing their Bitcoin forever
 
05:39:31.850 --> 05:39:31.860 align:start position:0%
or whatever crypto we're talking about
 
05:39:33.830 --> 05:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm with you and they want someone who's
 
05:39:36.050 --> 05:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
an expert at it to keep it safe for them
 
05:39:37.310 --> 05:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
and that's what these rules are about
 
05:39:39.890 --> 05:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
05:39:41.470 --> 05:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
oh God
 
05:39:44.750 --> 05:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
 
05:39:47.390 --> 05:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm on the outside okay I just I
 
05:39:48.890 --> 05:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
don't agree with anything that's going
 
05:39:53.868 --> 05:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
on but uh the uh the electronic uh uh
 
05:39:57.190 --> 05:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
code that you get which is your digital
 
05:40:00.288 --> 05:40:00.298 align:start position:0%
signature that you're in custody of
 
05:40:04.128 --> 05:40:04.138 align:start position:0%
whatever the assets are now this
 
05:40:07.368 --> 05:40:07.378 align:start position:0%
so I would lose it before I left the
 
05:40:10.670 --> 05:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
auditorium so that you go and give it to
 
05:40:13.368 --> 05:40:13.378 align:start position:0%
your lawyer or somebody who's a trust
 
05:40:16.190 --> 05:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
officer I'm I'm just would you believe
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
my question is who do you give it to
 
05:40:21.650 --> 05:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
you're are you advising these people to
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
have a who do you give it
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
so that's an interesting question so
 
05:40:29.030 --> 05:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
there are companies nationally and I
 
05:40:31.430 --> 05:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
think even some locally and I'll just
 
05:40:33.470 --> 05:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
give a plug to the New Hampshire Bankers
 
05:40:36.410 --> 05:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
Association last fall I think it was
 
05:40:38.930 --> 05:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
they had a cryptocurrency conference and
 
05:40:40.730 --> 05:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
they had they had Banks and interested
 
05:40:42.250 --> 05:40:42.260 align:start position:0%
parties from all over the state
 
05:40:45.590 --> 05:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
discussing just that how could they get
 
05:40:47.750 --> 05:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
into the the business if if their
 
05:40:49.850 --> 05:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
customers are looking for it of costing
 
05:40:51.948 --> 05:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
things so we're seeing that ecosystem I
 
05:40:53.030 --> 05:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
think you used that word earlier today
 
05:40:55.730 --> 05:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
it's growing and uh you know having
 
05:40:58.368 --> 05:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
rules is important we saw the FTX
 
05:41:01.128 --> 05:41:01.138 align:start position:0%
imploded because they were outside the
 
05:41:03.110 --> 05:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
U.S jurisdiction they were in the
 
05:41:04.970 --> 05:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
Bahamas and there was they weren't
 
05:41:06.350 --> 05:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
following any of these guidelines so
 
05:41:07.730 --> 05:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
that this is really a consumer
 
05:41:10.448 --> 05:41:10.458 align:start position:0%
protection bill as as it is you know
 
05:41:13.550 --> 05:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
attracting the industry to our state uh
 
05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully can I have another uh I have
 
05:41:17.930 --> 05:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
another question follow-up questions
 
05:41:17.940 --> 05:41:18.770 align:start position:0%
another question follow-up questions
um

05:41:18.770 --> 05:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:18.780 --> 05:41:20.208 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:41:20.208 --> 05:41:20.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:20.218 --> 05:41:20.930 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:41:20.930 --> 05:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:23.390 --> 05:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
I have a bunch of assets and I go to my
 
05:41:29.030 --> 05:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
lawyer and can I put this into what I
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
would consider a trust and and it could
 
05:41:33.230 --> 05:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
be any number of Assets in the same
 
05:41:37.788 --> 05:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
trust and these my signature story or
 
05:41:39.708 --> 05:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
signature is this
 
05:41:42.410 --> 05:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
long long digital
 
05:41:42.420 --> 05:41:43.730 align:start position:0%
long long digital
Sig

05:41:43.730 --> 05:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
Sig
 
05:41:45.770 --> 05:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
but it but I can put everything in it
 
05:41:47.868 --> 05:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
just like a regular trust I could do a
 
05:41:50.690 --> 05:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
house and uh is that what I defer to Mr
 
05:41:52.970 --> 05:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
perlow on that question but I think that
 
05:41:56.090 --> 05:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
a trust can be set up to custody and I
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
believe they'd have to uh
 
05:42:00.110 --> 05:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
they'd have to follow the guidelines of
 
05:42:02.930 --> 05:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
U.S UCC article 12 to the extent that
 
05:42:05.208 --> 05:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
they apply okay I'm thinking like I go
 
05:42:07.490 --> 05:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
to my bank that's what yeah it's it's so
 
05:42:09.050 --> 05:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go on too long because I
 
05:42:12.590 --> 05:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
know we're late but uh the digital
 
05:42:14.330 --> 05:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
um asset can represent something
 
05:42:16.970 --> 05:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
physical it could or could represent uh
 
05:42:18.770 --> 05:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
a share of stock in a company it could
 
05:42:20.810 --> 05:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
represent the title to your house things
 
05:42:23.208 --> 05:42:23.218 align:start position:0%
like that so
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's a quick question okay okay sure
 
05:42:28.310 --> 05:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
represent a post
 
05:42:30.288 --> 05:42:30.298 align:start position:0%
um so is it like a 401k you could put it
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
in your money in your Digital Credit
 
05:42:36.770 --> 05:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
record in in your 401k or or it doesn't
 
05:42:40.128 --> 05:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
have to be a specific bank or uh well I
 
05:42:43.010 --> 05:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
think 401K is set up for tax purposes so
 
05:42:44.890 --> 05:42:44.900 align:start position:0%
it would be a collection of assets
 
05:42:47.930 --> 05:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
similar to a 401k but the the tax
 
05:42:49.610 --> 05:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
implications are different so unless
 
05:42:51.948 --> 05:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
it's a 401k for digital assets I mean
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
that that's as close as I can get to an
 
05:42:53.520 --> 05:42:54.288 align:start position:0%
that that's as close as I can get to an
answer

05:42:54.288 --> 05:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
answer
 
05:42:57.128 --> 05:42:57.138 align:start position:0%
so dinner
 
05:42:59.868 --> 05:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
further questions you require so in your
 
05:43:01.788 --> 05:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
401k you're you're put you can buy
 
05:43:04.490 --> 05:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
stocks and everything in there would you
 
05:43:06.410 --> 05:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
be able to do that with like
 
05:43:08.990 --> 05:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
sort of like a 401k but it's a it's a
 
05:43:12.110 --> 05:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
different kind of banking system
 
05:43:14.930 --> 05:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
um it touches on that but it's it what
 
05:43:16.490 --> 05:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is outside of what
 
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
this bill so the buying and selling of
 
05:43:20.990 --> 05:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
digital assets that's not covered by
 
05:43:23.448 --> 05:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
this this is really about who controls
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
them if you give them to a third party
 
05:43:27.948 --> 05:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
what are their responsibilities if it's
 
05:43:31.128 --> 05:43:31.138 align:start position:0%
a contract how does it get executed how
 
05:43:32.868 --> 05:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
does an asset get perfected I think is a
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
term they use so it touches on that but
 
05:43:38.090 --> 05:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's what you're buying and selling is
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
outside of this
 
05:43:44.288 --> 05:43:44.298 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right
 
05:43:47.208 --> 05:43:47.218 align:start position:0%
so uh Aaron normally I would Aaron
 
05:43:49.010 --> 05:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
normally I would have you up but would
 
05:43:50.270 --> 05:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
you would you think we should have the
 
05:43:52.670 --> 05:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
law commission come up first
 
05:43:52.680 --> 05:43:53.930 align:start position:0%
law commission come up first
okay

05:43:53.930 --> 05:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:43:56.890 --> 05:43:56.900 align:start position:0%
I know you would say that Tom
 
05:43:59.510 --> 05:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
but I but I you know we're supposed to
 
05:44:01.628 --> 05:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
respect you know officers
 
05:44:04.430 --> 05:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
all right so Chuck Mooney from the
 
05:44:06.770 --> 05:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission so I'll give my
 
05:44:08.090 --> 05:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
short little story about the law
 
05:44:10.548 --> 05:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
commission uh is when I first got on
 
05:44:12.830 --> 05:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
this committee most of the bills would
 
05:44:15.230 --> 05:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
be small little short pieces of bills
 
05:44:17.330 --> 05:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
for little sections of the internet but
 
05:44:21.470 --> 05:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
it right behind uh Rick and uh you guys
 
05:44:25.250 --> 05:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
will see our lsrs back there and we have
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
whole books dedicated to UCC
 
05:44:33.230 --> 05:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
and each UCC was representative of each
 
05:44:35.030 --> 05:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
of the different elements of commercial
 
05:44:37.670 --> 05:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
code and yes it is supposedly they were
 
05:44:40.610 --> 05:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
all the same every state has passed it
 
05:44:43.250 --> 05:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
rather than having a federal law we have
 
05:44:46.490 --> 05:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
individual states past the same law and
 
05:44:49.128 --> 05:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
here is our New Hampshire representative
 
05:44:52.010 --> 05:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Chuck uh thank you my
 
05:44:54.288 --> 05:44:54.298 align:start position:0%
name is Charles Mooney I'm a professor
 
05:44:56.090 --> 05:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
of law Emeritus from the University of
 
05:44:59.448 --> 05:44:59.458 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania Law School I retired
 
05:45:02.270 --> 05:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
recently after 36 years on the faculty
 
05:45:05.208 --> 05:45:05.218 align:start position:0%
and after 14 years of law practice
 
05:45:08.208 --> 05:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
much more important since November of
 
05:45:10.788 --> 05:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
last year I've been a new Proud resident
 
05:45:12.590 --> 05:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire
 
05:45:15.170 --> 05:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm very very happy to be here and I
 
05:45:16.310 --> 05:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
had my first
 
05:45:21.048 --> 05:45:21.058 align:start position:0%
Driving Experience on the I-93 this
 
05:45:22.430 --> 05:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon and
 
05:45:24.110 --> 05:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
I won't say anymore
 
05:45:27.708 --> 05:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
uh but I am very grateful for the
 
05:45:31.390 --> 05:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say a few things about HB
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
584 I don't think I can match the
 
05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
eloquence of Representative amen
 
05:45:41.570 --> 05:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh but I maybe can answer a few of the
 
05:45:44.330 --> 05:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
questions that have been raised but just
 
05:45:47.708 --> 05:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
by way of a background the uniform law
 
05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
commission is a private organization but
 
05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
its Commissioners are all appointed by
 
05:45:52.558 --> 05:45:53.930 align:start position:0%
its Commissioners are all appointed by
States

05:45:53.930 --> 05:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
States
 
05:45:57.110 --> 05:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
and they adopt uniform laws whether it's
 
05:46:00.288 --> 05:46:00.298 align:start position:0%
the uniform gifts to minors act or the
 
05:46:03.590 --> 05:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
Uniform Commercial Code and although the
 
05:46:05.570 --> 05:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
Uniform Commercial Code the UCC estate
 
05:46:09.048 --> 05:46:09.058 align:start position:0%
law since the 1960s it's really been the
 
05:46:11.448 --> 05:46:11.458 align:start position:0%
law of the land for commercial law and
 
05:46:13.310 --> 05:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
that would include private transactions
 
05:46:17.330 --> 05:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
including many consumer transactions
 
05:46:20.810 --> 05:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
so the UCC governs transactions as
 
05:46:23.330 --> 05:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
varies as sales and leases
 
05:46:25.970 --> 05:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
of goods negotiable instruments Bank
 
05:46:28.250 --> 05:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
collections funds transfers letters of
 
05:46:30.350 --> 05:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
credit Investments securities
 
05:46:33.410 --> 05:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
and secured transactions so if you buy
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
Goods on Amazon or use get a loan
 
05:46:39.530 --> 05:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
secured by an automobile or have a
 
05:46:40.850 --> 05:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
Securities account
 
05:46:43.368 --> 05:46:43.378 align:start position:0%
the same law the UCC applies throughout
 
05:46:46.070 --> 05:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
this uniformity and enactment by all
 
05:46:53.330 --> 05:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions is very important as is
 
05:46:56.270 --> 05:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
the substance of the law to to modernize
 
05:46:59.990 --> 05:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
the law and so that's why as already
 
05:47:01.548 --> 05:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
explained it's important for New
 
05:47:04.250 --> 05:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to get the final version of
 
05:47:06.430 --> 05:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
the of the text
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
enacted I will say that I was the
 
05:47:12.288 --> 05:47:12.298 align:start position:0%
reporter the principal drafter of the
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
night 2022
 
05:47:17.510 --> 05:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh amendments and I and I think it's
 
05:47:19.310 --> 05:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
fair to say that these amendments bring
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
the UCC fully into the 21st century and
 
05:47:26.628 --> 05:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
starting in 2019 a new committee was
 
05:47:29.330 --> 05:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
formed to consider emerging Technologies
 
05:47:33.170 --> 05:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
we met uh 18 times each time for two or
 
05:47:36.350 --> 05:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
three days along with many meetings of
 
05:47:38.090 --> 05:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
smaller groups and meetings of
 
05:47:42.048 --> 05:47:42.058 align:start position:0%
constituencies and finally this past
 
05:47:44.048 --> 05:47:44.058 align:start position:0%
spring and summer the two sponsors
 
05:47:46.190 --> 05:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission and the American
 
05:47:49.850 --> 05:47:49.860 align:start position:0%
law Institute adopted the final aversion
 
05:47:54.650 --> 05:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
I was uh intrigued by the advance move
 
05:47:57.770 --> 05:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
which I thought was very cool by New
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to adapt the not quite final
 
05:48:02.750 --> 05:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
draft I grew up in Oklahoma where we
 
05:48:04.910 --> 05:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
were known as the sooner States because
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the folks that we all thought maybe
 
05:48:08.810 --> 05:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
they'd go the night before and start
 
05:48:11.208 --> 05:48:11.218 align:start position:0%
staking their claims so it was named
 
05:48:13.448 --> 05:48:13.458 align:start position:0%
after a bunch of crooks but
 
05:48:16.610 --> 05:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
but this is this is what Sooners really
 
05:48:19.250 --> 05:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
ought to be about as being on the front
 
05:48:21.288 --> 05:48:21.298 align:start position:0%
and I gather we're going to hear a lot
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
more about that when it comes to the
 
05:48:24.368 --> 05:48:24.378 align:start position:0%
primaries in
 
05:48:28.850 --> 05:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
2024 being first as as well nearly every
 
05:48:30.890 --> 05:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
article at the UCC is amended and
 
05:48:33.110 --> 05:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
brought up today and these amendments
 
05:48:35.170 --> 05:48:35.180 align:start position:0%
but the Crown Jewel
 
05:48:38.270 --> 05:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
as the representative mentioned is is
 
05:48:41.628 --> 05:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
article 12 on controllable electronic
 
05:48:43.730 --> 05:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
records or cers
 
05:48:46.850 --> 05:48:46.860 align:start position:0%
not too pithy but it's a type of digital
 
05:48:50.810 --> 05:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
asset but one electronic record
 
05:48:53.330 --> 05:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
just a record that's electronic but one
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
that can be subject to control
 
05:48:59.150 --> 05:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
and that's analogous to possession of
 
05:49:02.990 --> 05:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
this pen or physical property so digital
 
05:49:04.610 --> 05:49:04.620 align:start position:0%
assets well
 
05:49:07.270 --> 05:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's your emails that's
 
05:49:10.730 --> 05:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
a music CD
 
05:49:13.190 --> 05:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's an it's lots of things but we're
 
05:49:14.628 --> 05:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
only talking about things that can
 
05:49:16.730 --> 05:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
really be possessed so that they have a
 
05:49:20.208 --> 05:49:20.218 align:start position:0%
the property like a quality that can be
 
05:49:20.218 --> 05:49:22.970 align:start position:0%
the property like a quality that can be
controlled

05:49:22.970 --> 05:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
controlled
 
05:49:26.930 --> 05:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
yes it includes crypto like Bitcoin but
 
05:49:30.048 --> 05:49:30.058 align:start position:0%
also digital assets that can be linked
 
05:49:33.410 --> 05:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
or Tethered to other assets whether that
 
05:49:39.288 --> 05:49:39.298 align:start position:0%
be uh valuable metals or right to access
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
a certain artwork like so-called
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
non-fungible tokens uh nfts more
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
important perhaps uh the blockchain
 
05:49:50.390 --> 05:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
check not technology on which many of
 
05:49:54.410 --> 05:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
these cers are based has many uses that
 
05:49:57.288 --> 05:49:57.298 align:start position:0%
in the future may be very important in
 
05:50:00.650 --> 05:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
the world of Finance
 
05:50:02.690 --> 05:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:50:06.830 --> 05:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
what article 12 does is provide building
 
05:50:11.390 --> 05:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
block property rules for these assets
 
05:50:14.350 --> 05:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
like you've all read about FTX the
 
05:50:17.690 --> 05:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
bankrupt custodian of customer
 
05:50:20.930 --> 05:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
assets I I think probably we can all
 
05:50:22.850 --> 05:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
agree that some form of important
 
05:50:25.730 --> 05:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
regulation is needed for this industry
 
05:50:28.070 --> 05:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
probably some State probably some
 
05:50:28.080 --> 05:50:29.448 align:start position:0%
probably some State probably some
federal

05:50:29.448 --> 05:50:29.458 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:50:31.390 --> 05:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
but Regulators have a hard time
 
05:50:33.230 --> 05:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
regulating something when they're
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about someone's property
 
05:50:37.730 --> 05:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
if you don't have any property rules
 
05:50:39.730 --> 05:50:39.740 align:start position:0%
that make some sense to govern that
 
05:50:42.170 --> 05:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
property and we really don't have those
 
05:50:45.288 --> 05:50:45.298 align:start position:0%
for Pure intangibles but through this
 
05:50:48.830 --> 05:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
concept of control possession we have
 
05:50:48.840 --> 05:50:50.090 align:start position:0%
concept of control possession we have
this

05:50:50.090 --> 05:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:50:52.850 --> 05:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:50:54.830 --> 05:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
I hope that's useful if you have any
 
05:50:57.230 --> 05:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
further questions I'd be happy to answer
 
05:50:58.970 --> 05:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
them but it's my honor to be here today
 
05:51:01.730 --> 05:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your attention
 
05:51:04.010 --> 05:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
welcome to New Hampshire thank you very
 
05:51:04.020 --> 05:51:07.090 align:start position:0%
welcome to New Hampshire thank you very
much

05:51:07.090 --> 05:51:07.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:16.930 --> 05:51:16.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:19.730 --> 05:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
does Bitcoin have a special State
 
05:51:23.390 --> 05:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
because El Salvador adopted it as their
 
05:51:25.490 --> 05:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
well actually it's very interesting
 
05:51:28.250 --> 05:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
according to probably the majority of
 
05:51:30.530 --> 05:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
the people that have looked at it
 
05:51:33.708 --> 05:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin right now may be money
 
05:51:36.170 --> 05:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
as defined in the UCC
 
05:51:39.470 --> 05:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
but the UCC doesn't regulate money very
 
05:51:41.990 --> 05:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
much it basically just talks about when
 
05:51:44.208 --> 05:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
you're a good faith purchaser and an
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
asset possession an asset
 
05:51:49.010 --> 05:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
but that's concerning for a variety of
 
05:51:51.410 --> 05:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
reasons that can make convert things
 
05:51:53.770 --> 05:51:53.780 align:start position:0%
into monetary obligations that we don't
 
05:51:56.270 --> 05:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
intend so
 
05:51:59.990 --> 05:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
the new amendments make it clear that
 
05:52:03.948 --> 05:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin would not be money in the UCC
 
05:52:06.530 --> 05:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
only a form of electronic money that's
 
05:52:08.628 --> 05:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
adopted by a state
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
that did not previously exist
 
05:52:14.270 --> 05:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
as this kind of controllable electronic
 
05:52:16.788 --> 05:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
record so if the United States wants to
 
05:52:18.708 --> 05:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
create a central bank digital currency
 
05:52:21.890 --> 05:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
which we heard earlier yes it could do
 
05:52:23.990 --> 05:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
so and so could El Salvador anyone else
 
05:52:26.570 --> 05:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
but if it's a pre-existing
 
05:52:26.580 --> 05:52:28.190 align:start position:0%
but if it's a pre-existing
private

05:52:28.190 --> 05:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
private
 
05:52:31.010 --> 05:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
controllable electronic record
 
05:52:34.430 --> 05:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
then like Bitcoin it could not ex post
 
05:52:36.350 --> 05:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
be adopted by a state it could be
 
05:52:38.030 --> 05:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
adopted by a state but it would not be
 
05:52:41.930 --> 05:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
money as the UCC defines it
 
05:52:45.410 --> 05:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
where they came from representative
 
05:52:47.628 --> 05:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
thank you it's it's just a really minor
 
05:52:49.610 --> 05:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
question I I love hearing about this
 
05:52:51.470 --> 05:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
stuff but do you have a reference that
 
05:52:52.548 --> 05:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
you could
 
05:52:56.448 --> 05:52:56.458 align:start position:0%
provide like a website or a a book
 
05:52:58.270 --> 05:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
anything so we could learn some more
 
05:53:02.690 --> 05:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
absolutely we the the ulc has a a very
 
05:53:04.970 --> 05:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
brief overview
 
05:53:08.810 --> 05:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
and then a list of reasons why a state
 
05:53:11.090 --> 05:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
should enact it although essentially New
 
05:53:13.788 --> 05:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already has that the later
 
05:53:15.590 --> 05:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
amendments are important because
 
05:53:18.048 --> 05:53:18.058 align:start position:0%
technicality is important here but there
 
05:53:20.750 --> 05:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
are no major policy changes and that
 
05:53:23.208 --> 05:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
were that were made and then there's a
 
05:53:25.970 --> 05:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
longer 11 page thing so that people who
 
05:53:28.070 --> 05:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
want to study the UCC so you can go
 
05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
right on their website
 
05:53:32.570 --> 05:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
we've got those and we'll certainly make
 
05:53:34.610 --> 05:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
them available to the committee John I
 
05:53:37.270 --> 05:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
have a I have a commission a question
 
05:53:39.230 --> 05:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
 
05:53:43.788 --> 05:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
I one of my concerns about crypto or any
 
05:53:46.970 --> 05:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
any other uh currency
 
05:53:50.208 --> 05:53:50.218 align:start position:0%
than the dollar is that in the
 
05:53:51.948 --> 05:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
Constitution and this I think is very
 
05:53:54.110 --> 05:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
important Congress has
 
05:53:56.448 --> 05:53:56.458 align:start position:0%
been given a monopoly
 
05:53:58.368 --> 05:53:58.378 align:start position:0%
over the money supply
 
05:54:01.368 --> 05:54:01.378 align:start position:0%
and the Monopoly is is based upon the
 
05:54:04.430 --> 05:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
fact that you can only pay to your taxes
 
05:54:06.230 --> 05:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
in dollars
 
05:54:10.368 --> 05:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
so my con my question is
 
05:54:13.070 --> 05:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
I don't understand what the relationship
 
05:54:15.470 --> 05:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
if these if we get these digital
 
05:54:18.890 --> 05:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
currencies uh passed and accept it I
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
don't understand the relationship
 
05:54:25.250 --> 05:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh or what the impact may be of uh the
 
05:54:27.890 --> 05:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
Monopoly of the money supply if somebody
 
05:54:30.048 --> 05:54:30.058 align:start position:0%
else is making a lot of money
 
05:54:32.628 --> 05:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
uh digital or otherwise that is not
 
05:54:35.810 --> 05:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
controlled then that has will have
 
05:54:37.788 --> 05:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
impacts on the value of the dollar
 
05:54:37.798 --> 05:54:38.930 align:start position:0%
impacts on the value of the dollar
itself

05:54:38.930 --> 05:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
itself
 
05:54:41.930 --> 05:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
and and other things that concern me a
 
05:54:46.010 --> 05:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
lot so I'm asking you yes what do you
 
05:54:48.530 --> 05:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
think will be the impact if there is a
 
05:54:49.910 --> 05:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
secondary currency
 
05:54:51.948 --> 05:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
alongside the dollar
 
05:54:51.958 --> 05:54:54.350 align:start position:0%
alongside the dollar
well

05:54:54.350 --> 05:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:54:56.090 --> 05:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
unless the federal government decides
 
05:54:58.128 --> 05:54:58.138 align:start position:0%
it's going to be so there will not be
 
05:54:59.810 --> 05:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a safe bet the federal
 
05:55:01.250 --> 05:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
government will not
 
05:55:03.230 --> 05:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that these things could be
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
treated by barter like we could trade
 
05:55:09.170 --> 05:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
anything by barter and we don't stop
 
05:55:12.530 --> 05:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
people from from doing that although the
 
05:55:15.110 --> 05:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
the IRS certainly wants to know about
 
05:55:18.350 --> 05:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
transactions that give rise to gains but
 
05:55:21.110 --> 05:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
this doesn't affect what is legal tender
 
05:55:24.110 --> 05:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect anything that the FED
 
05:55:25.850 --> 05:55:25.860 align:start position:0%
has to do
 
05:55:25.860 --> 05:55:27.410 align:start position:0%
has to do
and

05:55:27.410 --> 05:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:55:30.048 --> 05:55:30.058 align:start position:0%
what is money for the UCC is basically
 
05:55:33.230 --> 05:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
what is a monetary obligation so that we
 
05:55:35.448 --> 05:55:35.458 align:start position:0%
know if a business is going to give a
 
05:55:38.448 --> 05:55:38.458 align:start position:0%
security interest in its receivables
 
05:55:41.330 --> 05:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh that's a right to payment
 
05:55:43.730 --> 05:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
and so we want to make sure that's not
 
05:55:43.740 --> 05:55:45.368 align:start position:0%
and so we want to make sure that's not
Bitcoin

05:55:45.368 --> 05:55:45.378 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin
 
05:55:48.890 --> 05:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
but as for other purposes money is still
 
05:55:50.810 --> 05:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
the same this does not affect that at
 
05:55:50.820 --> 05:55:52.070 align:start position:0%
the same this does not affect that at
all

05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:55:55.788 --> 05:55:55.798 align:start position:0%

secretary in my former seat mate in the

house floor
 
05:56:11.708 --> 05:56:11.718 align:start position:0%
and Tom Conley is our our state Guru
 
05:56:16.548 --> 05:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:18.470 --> 05:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair that's exactly what I
 
05:56:22.628 --> 05:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
was going to say and here is Tom
 
05:56:24.890 --> 05:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone my name is Tom
 
05:56:28.010 --> 05:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
Connolly and I run the UCC division for
 
05:56:29.868 --> 05:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office
 
05:56:32.208 --> 05:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
um here speak in support of the bill the
 
05:56:34.788 --> 05:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh certainly we're proud of the proud of
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that New Hampshire is the first
 
05:56:38.330 --> 05:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
state to adopt article 12 and uh one of
 
05:56:39.470 --> 05:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
the things I particularly like about the
 
05:56:41.390 --> 05:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
bill is that it has no effect on the
 
05:56:42.770 --> 05:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
operations it's Secretary of State's
 
05:56:44.390 --> 05:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
office at all
 
05:56:46.070 --> 05:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
um it's a free of government uh
 
05:56:48.530 --> 05:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
involvement so far it's a response to
 
05:56:50.930 --> 05:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
how digital assets are are handed or
 
05:56:53.208 --> 05:56:53.218 align:start position:0%
handled in commercial transactions um it
 
05:56:54.650 --> 05:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
is important that we adopt these these
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
technical amendments so that our our
 
05:56:57.708 --> 05:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
language is consistent with what was
 
05:56:59.330 --> 05:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
passed this year and I'm pretty certain
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
that a number of states will be joining
 
05:57:03.708 --> 05:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
us as uh as adopters of the article 12
 
05:57:09.850 --> 05:57:09.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:14.208 --> 05:57:14.218 align:start position:0%
they are they're taking no position
 
05:57:19.730 --> 05:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:21.650 --> 05:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
believe me if they had a problem they'd
 
05:57:22.810 --> 05:57:22.820 align:start position:0%
let us know
 
05:57:25.910 --> 05:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
05:57:28.430 --> 05:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's comfortable now
 
05:57:31.250 --> 05:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
so it is uh I can say
 
05:57:33.650 --> 05:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
um that the fact that we we're number
 
05:57:37.730 --> 05:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
one was it was due to Keith and Mr
 
05:57:40.548 --> 05:57:40.558 align:start position:0%
Conley as the reason we we were able to
 
05:57:43.310 --> 05:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
achieve to get over the the goal line
 
05:57:45.948 --> 05:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
and be the first state so that's the
 
05:57:50.708 --> 05:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:53.830 --> 05:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
isn't law yet
 
05:57:56.570 --> 05:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't
 
05:58:00.368 --> 05:58:00.378 align:start position:0%
we had to solve a steel problem first
 
05:58:02.990 --> 05:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
but all right so I I don't think we have
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
any questions so thank you for tuning in
 
05:58:06.350 --> 05:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure you were
 
05:58:09.470 --> 05:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
interested in the hearing itself
 
05:58:12.110 --> 05:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
okay so I have no more cards
 
05:58:14.448 --> 05:58:14.458 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry Ryan that I didn't get you
 
05:58:17.830 --> 05:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
to speak but you can send out a
 
05:58:20.390 --> 05:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
Oh I thought it was but all of a sudden
 
05:58:22.850 --> 05:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
it was appeared so I thought I missed
 
05:58:25.610 --> 05:58:25.620 align:start position:0%
mystery card so okay
 
05:58:27.948 --> 05:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
um otherwise I have
 
05:58:31.128 --> 05:58:31.138 align:start position:0%
um the copy of what I my uh the liquor
 
05:58:33.890 --> 05:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
commission's recommendation that I I
 
05:58:36.410 --> 05:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
think is a good idea for
 
05:58:39.048 --> 05:58:39.058 align:start position:0%
um the beer the liquor bill for the
 
05:58:42.048 --> 05:58:42.058 align:start position:0%
license uh suspension and so I have a
 
05:58:43.730 --> 05:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
copy here if everybody wants to have a
 
05:58:48.708 --> 05:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
copy and um and otherwise I've scheduled
 
05:58:52.128 --> 05:58:52.138 align:start position:0%
um I I myself uh really all I want to
 
05:58:53.930 --> 05:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
come two days a week rather than three
 
05:58:56.270 --> 05:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
days a week my wife is giving me hell
 
05:58:57.830 --> 05:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
because I do the county and it's four
 
05:59:00.650 --> 05:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
days a week and so what I did is um we
 
05:59:03.170 --> 05:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
are going to go back again to uh
 
05:59:05.650 --> 05:59:05.660 align:start position:0%
