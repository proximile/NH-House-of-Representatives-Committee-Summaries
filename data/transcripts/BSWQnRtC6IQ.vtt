01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
heard more clearly even though i am a
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
member of the
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
mass wearing a minority in the house and
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
the mass wearing majority amongst the
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
people in the state of new hampshire so
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
i represent timothy horrigan
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
from trafford county district six the
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
towns of durham and madbury
 
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
i come to you to introduce my bill hb
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
1088 an act relative to employee
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
protections from cohen 19 in the
 
01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.710 align:start position:0%
protections from cohen 19 in the
workplace

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.190 align:start position:0%
workplace
and

01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
something of a reaction to the you've
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
got several bills coming up today which
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
are uh
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
what you might call anti-vaxx mandate
 
01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.510 align:start position:0%
what you might call anti-vaxx mandate
bills

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
because ironically i'm the first one up
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
here so
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
and mine is sort of the flip side of
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
that so it's
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
pretty self-explanatory i guess it's
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
only a couple of sentences so i'll read
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
it here
 
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
an employee shall have the right to be
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated against covet 19 and the
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
right to use personal protective
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
equipment such as face masks
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
and face shields while employed in the
 
01:01:10.799 --> 01:01:12.549 align:start position:0%
and face shields while employed in the
workplace

01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
as i'm not sure where else you where
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
you'd be employed but anyway as
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
well employed in the workplace
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
no employer shall discriminate in any
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
way against an employee based on the
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
employee exercising his or her rights
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
and this is specifically about covet 19
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
although i suppose
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
there are this could arrive with other
 
01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.789 align:start position:0%
there are this could arrive with other
uh

01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
other epidemics or pandemics in the
 
01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:42.230 align:start position:0%
other epidemics or pandemics in the
future

01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
because i said it was self-explanatory
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
but i'll still explain anyway
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
if and when hb 1088 gets passed on the
 
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.270 align:start position:0%
if and when hb 1088 gets passed on the
law

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
your employer cannot fire you or
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
discriminate you against you in any
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
other way if you choose to get
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated against covet 19 your
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
employer can also not
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
stop you from wearing ppe's although
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
all workers are the right to protect
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
themselves and highly contagious and
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
highly dangerous disease which has
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
already killed over 875 000 americans
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
and will certainly soon kill over
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
american at the weight rate we're going
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
it's about um it'll uh
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
well anyway we'll do that with the next
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
couple of months
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
i don't specifically know of any new
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire employers have banned vaccines
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
in the workplace but i can point you in
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
the case of the settler school of
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
private school of miami who in april
 
01:02:31.839 --> 01:02:33.670 align:start position:0%
private school of miami who in april
2021

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
announced that they would no longer hire
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
any facts for vaccinated teachers
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
um the school was widely praised in the
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
right-wing blogosphere including here in
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire by granite brock where
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
several leading members of this house
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
regularly blog and
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
and um the uh there have
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
there have been some new hampshire
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
employers who
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
have reportedly tried to ban ppes or who
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
used the mass mandates during the 2021
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
state of emergency as explanation for
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
their business decision to shut down
 
01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.549 align:start position:0%
their business decision to shut down
i'm

01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
i have several assumptions behind when i
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill which are i think
 
01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:09.829 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill which are i think
they're

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:03:09.839 --> 01:03:11.430 align:start position:0%
they're
generally

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
accepted outside the state house but
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
more controversial here at the state
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
house which is
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
one the covet 19 pandemic is one of the
 
01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
worst catastrophes in human history so
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
875 000 is
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
i believe it's a bigger death toll than
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
any catastrophe anything that has
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
happened bad that has happened usa uh i
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
think with the exception of the civil
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
war in fact maybe even worse than the
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
civil war
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
um vaccines are worthwhile even not 100
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
effective or 100 safe
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
back three vaccines ahead i believe
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
they're all
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
very safe and very effective maybe not
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
100 so but i believe they
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
are safe they've been proven to be safe
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
and effective and the development
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
process was very careful it was
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
the vaccines made you less successful
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
the coca-19 make you less likely to
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
spread it to others
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
and the mass and the other pves are
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
worthwhile even if they're not 100
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
effective and even if
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
even if not all the masks that i see
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
some members of the community not all of
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
them are surgical great mass
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
they're actually all
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
being worn pretty much the right way so
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
which i'm
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
i've trouble with myself but uh still
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
they're not 100 effective but
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the difference is 90 95 99 that
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
still makes them worthwhile and
 
01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.190 align:start position:0%
still makes them worthwhile and
finally

01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
there is no natural
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
or civil right to spread deadly
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
respiratory virus so
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
so basically this bill just
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
allows all employees to to
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
do what they need to do to protect
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
themselves against
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
catching the covered 19 virus so they
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
don't get infected themselves they don't
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
affect their family or also even so they
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
don't affect people they don't even know
 
01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:01.349 align:start position:0%
don't affect people they don't even know
so

01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
there's committing the vote ought to
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
pass on this bill
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
if committee has any questions and i'll
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh try to answer them thank you
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative are there any questions

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
cope at 19 so being vaccinated against
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
diseases wasn't controversial until uh
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
until a couple of years ago so
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are like a number of other about a
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
dozen other deadly diseases that we've
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh that we vaccinate ourselves against
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
it was never a problem until the coca-19
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
thing came around and came around kind
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
strange time in our nation's history
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
anyway but um i um
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
frankly i do not know i mean you
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
certainly uh can check the
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
um check the uh law books for yourself
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
certainly when i drafted the bill they
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
didn't tell me that duplicated anything
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
that was already on the books so they
 
01:06:14.079 --> 01:06:14.789 align:start position:0%
that was already on the books so they
they

01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
did do their due diligence and i did
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
mine as well so the best of my knowledge
 
01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.789 align:start position:0%
mine as well so the best of my knowledge
the

01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
statute is uh
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
the statute is it even if it's
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it's probably harmless but i
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
think i think it's necessary thank you
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
paul by representative mandeville
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you uh
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
representative for the question on line
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
three of your bill it says an employee
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
shall have a right to be vaccinated
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
against uh covet 19.
 
01:06:45.039 --> 01:06:46.950 align:start position:0%
against uh covet 19.
um

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any examples in new
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire and if so
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
the exact number of employees that have
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
been denied the ability to get
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated because their employer said
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
you can't get a vaccine
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know specifically i do know i
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
did mention that employer from out of
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
state and they were certainly
 
01:07:03.599 --> 01:07:05.029 align:start position:0%
state and they were certainly
praised

01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
praised
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
by uh in an outlet at least one outlet
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
that has a lot of influence here in new
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire so people were they were
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
definitely the darlings of the
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
right-wing blogosphere at least for
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
several weeks so there presumably there
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
are there may be employers who would
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
want to ban people in fact being
 
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.309 align:start position:0%
want to ban people in fact being
vaccinated

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
and not to spread too much information
 
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.910 align:start position:0%
and not to spread too much information
but

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm trying to like counter
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
back what i feel is misinformation by
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
repeating it maybe i shouldn't be doing
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
this but we have certainly heard many
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
many people in this
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
many members of the house come up and
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
say that the vaccines make you more
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
contagious which my opinion
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
and based on the studies i have seen the
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
research i've done is totally not true
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
but and somebody's inconsistent with how
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
other vaccines have worked in the past
 
01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
other vaccines have worked in the past
follow-up

01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um just to be clear
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
the acoustics for my years in here are
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
not good so i have trouble hearing you
 
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.670 align:start position:0%
not good so i have trouble hearing you
um

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
just to be clear
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the number of
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
instances you know of an employer
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
denying an employee the right to be
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
vaccinated is zero simple yes or no
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
um i don't know whether it's zero or
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
which doesn't necessarily mean this is a
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
bad bill like so
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
somebody might want to do that at some
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
point in the future so representative
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
mandeville thank you mr chairman um
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for testifying
 
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.669 align:start position:0%
and thank you for testifying
i

01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
i note that the rights
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
provided in this proposed bill
 
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:40.950 align:start position:0%
provided in this proposed bill
relate

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
relate
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
to both both to
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
vaccination and also to ppe
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
but that the vaccination applies
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
specifically to covet 19. is there any
 
01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.709 align:start position:0%
specifically to covet 19. is there any
reason

01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply more generally in
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
respect to vaccinations in your view
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
i was just trying to keep it as simple
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
as possible and as i said the other
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are not controversial we've
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
been vaccinating ourselves
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
well with going back to when we felt a
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
smallpox vaccine and polio and it was
 
01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.430 align:start position:0%
smallpox vaccine and polio and it was
never

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
it wasn't there was never a big
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
controversy over it until until until
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
now and i cited
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
i just that was uh that was how i wrote
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
it specifically for
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
this uh pandemic and
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
this uh this virus i mean you're
 
01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.229 align:start position:0%
this uh this virus i mean you're
certainly

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
certainly if you think it should be more
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
general um
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
it's your it's in your possession now
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
the committee can certainly uh
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
they want to broaden it i would probably
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh i would i would not necessarily i
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
would probably view that as a friendly
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative representative uh
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
i'll think of it a second
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
cahill had to stand up
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you to
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
the representative for taking my
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
sorry representative proud i had a brain
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
cramp for a second my apologies
 
01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
cramp for a second my apologies
um

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit struggling to see how
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
um a employer could discriminate against
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
someone for being vaccinated is it the
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill to
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
prevent an employer from discriminating
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
someone needing time off for the vaccine
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
or recovered for it or just from the the
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
their actual status as vaccinated and
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
how would you
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
foresee an employer even knowing
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
someone's status if they didn't want to
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
disclose it
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
well both my main concern was
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
you might have an employer who would
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
forbid people from vaccination because
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
they believe the misinformation that is
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
being spread here in the house there
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
almost every day but also
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
i believe i mean there's already things
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
in the labor law that uh
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
that for that would make the employers
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
accommodate the medical needs but i mean
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
if that's not clear the bill i certainly
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
i certainly think employers should give
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
people time off to get the vaccine if
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
they need it the actual uh
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
the actual jab only takes a few minutes
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
but you know there is you have to watch
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
yourself afterwards because there is a
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
recovery process because it's a powerful
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
disease it takes a powerful vaccine to
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
counteract it but i mean i'm certainly i
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
said i think employers
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
should allow their employees time off to
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated and allow them to take
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
sick time if they have a if they have a
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
reaction as uh as some do
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you so it is your intent from
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
establishing this right to create a new
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
more specific
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
requirement for employers to give
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
employees time off in these
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances um that's well the bill is
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
not quite clearly
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
clear where did i would i think that
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
would not be a bad idea so if you want
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
if you agree to employ you should have
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
the time off and you need to clarify
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
that once again just as
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
the other representative is concerned uh
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
that would probably not be a sticking
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
point for me so you can bend the bill if
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
you want certainly employers
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
and i think just about any responsible
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
employer would should give you time off
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated if you need it and they
 
01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.910 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated if you need it and they
should

01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
some you know even this even actually
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
even here
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
at the state house we had a we had a
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinic just for
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
legislators and staff people i think
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's something that you know
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
every employer who has the capacity to
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
do that should do
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
but i have more of an answer to that but
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think specifically
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah the main
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
wording is just to make sure that people
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh workers can get vaccinated regardless
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
of what their employer's opinion about
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
the vaccines might be the thing
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions to the
 
01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.229 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions to the
representative

01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
i only have one additional pink card
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
unless there's any others for house bill
 
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.110 align:start position:0%
unless there's any others for house bill
1088

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
1088
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
you committee chair and thank you
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing allowing me to
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
speak today i
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
want to start by saying that this bill
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
is just more discrimination
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
number one number two
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
the issue here is
 
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.310 align:start position:0%
the issue here is
if

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to say
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
you have to tell me if you're vaccinated
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
or non-vaccinated to have a job
 
01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.310 align:start position:0%
or non-vaccinated to have a job
then

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
then you're discriminating because that
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
is personal choice
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
number two or whatever um that would
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
this is opening up a huge camera can of
 
01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.110 align:start position:0%
this is opening up a huge camera can of
worms

01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
worms
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
if we have if we open something like
 
01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.870 align:start position:0%
if we have if we open something like
this

01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
then we're saying we can discriminate
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
against someone who's hiv positive we
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
can discriminate against someone who's
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
pregnant we can discriminate against
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
someone who has any other kind of
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
condition whether by choice or by by
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
by virtue of health
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
and that's not okay
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's the bottom line i'd like to um
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
explain or or kind of counter some of
 
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
his disparaging remarks regarding what
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
he's heard about the misinformation from
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
the cdc website there are over thirty
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
five thousand systematic breakthroughs
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
cases each week
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
that was quoted from the website to
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
contra or from cdc at a confidential
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
briefing to conflicts on 7 29 22. he
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
talks about all the um all the the
 
01:14:34.239 --> 01:14:35.350 align:start position:0%
talks about all the um all the the
research

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
and studies that he's done but i have uh
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
21 i'm sorry um i saw the confusion on
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
your face
 
01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.630 align:start position:0%
your face

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
um he talks about the the the all the
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
things that he's heard and i've listened

01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
meetings where he's disparaging
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
people that have gone through some of
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
these issues and he's sitting there and
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
shaking his head and telling and like
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
making noises and stuff like that that's
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
not okay the fact that someone's excuse
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
me point of order
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry please speak about the

because i can't have the vaccine and i
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
am being discriminated against
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
and but i accept it because i understand
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is he says that
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
we we've heard today through testimony
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
that the vaccines are safe and effective
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
again from the cdc website anaphylactic
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%

go away myocarditis and pericarditis
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
reports the death after the covin-19
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine are rare however it's required
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
to report to the vare system the vast
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%

united states citizens that have died
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
from these vaccine shots i don't call
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%

recognized to speak
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
good morning and i'll make it brief
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
um i feel our constitution already
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
protects employees i don't think we need
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
more legislation in this regard
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
if someone chooses to be vaccinated or
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated is none of the employer's
 
01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.910 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated is none of the employer's
business

01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
for them to be prevented to be able to
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
be gainfully employed i we don't allow
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
employers to
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's labor laws i know that there's
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
this little government overreach not to
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
say a business owner
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
can't mandate that all of their
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
employees be vaccinated and this is the
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
reverse of that
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
that you know if i opened a shop and i'm
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
liberty minded say i only want to hire
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
people that didn't get the vaccinated i
 
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
get what he's trying to accomplish here
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
but our constitutional rights should
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
already be protecting us either way to
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
put another layer of legislation on top
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
of this is ridiculous what was
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
misinformation two years ago is now
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
being proven to be
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
actually accurate information we're
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
learning here as we go but if you have
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
someone who's covered recovered if you
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
have a jehovah's witness i love this
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
example jehovah's witness pregnant
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
mother comes running into the er to me
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
and she's about to go into early labor
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
and she says please save me and save my
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
baby to the best of your ability but i
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
do not want blood products
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
but blood products are going to save
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
your life but blood products are safe
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
they're proven what am i supposed to do
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
as a registered nurse but to honor the
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
fact that she does not want blood
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
products right and yet we've completely
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
reversed this in this pandemic
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
employers have no business
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
getting involved with constitutional
 
01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.709 align:start position:0%
getting involved with constitutional
rights

01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
people have the right to choose what's
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
best for their body
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
my body is completely organic
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm a registered nurse i have not put
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
any pharmaceutical into my body
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's my choice just like a jehovah's
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
witness does not want blood products
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
i should not have to lose my pension my
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
health care my ability to be
 
01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.229 align:start position:0%
health care my ability to be
unproductive

01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
unproductive
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
pursue a happiness in my in my community
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
right business owners have the right to
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
do what they want to do to some extent
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
but let's be honest most of our
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
businesses now our big businesses our
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals are really an extension of
 
01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.910 align:start position:0%
hospitals are really an extension of
government

01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's not me with an ice cream shop
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's a heavily regulated
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
big corporation getting incentives
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
financial incentives
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
to mandate things that they want to do
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's the line is crossed when it comes
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
to my body
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
my health i have to live with gillian
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
beret i have to live with the side
 
01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.550 align:start position:0%
beret i have to live with the side
effect

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's my choice whether i want to take
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
the risk reward of going in and having
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
covet and how my body will respond to
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
that just like it is for the 70 year old
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
to make their choice that's not
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
something we should be dealing with on
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
the legislative
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
so if this is going to go in it would
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
need to be amended that the employer
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
should not be able to discriminate
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
on me whether i'm not vaccinated
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
or whether someone is vaccinated you
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
can't have it go just one way
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion we're already covered
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
by the constitution we don't need to put
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
more layers of nonsense
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
it just paints us all into a corner and
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
it makes a bigger mess for us all to
 
01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.550 align:start position:0%
it makes a bigger mess for us all to
unravel

01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
unravel
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the speaker
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
i have one if you wouldn't mind
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
i've heard what the last two presenters
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
have said you've talked about your
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
rights this bill specifically says an
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
employee shall have the right to be
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
vaccinated against covet 19
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the right to use personal protective
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
equipment such as a face mask and a face
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
shield while employed in the workplace
 
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.270 align:start position:0%
shield while employed in the workplace
correct

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any situations where an
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
employer has refused to allow someone to
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated or refuse to allow someone
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
to utilize protective devices
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
no and i would say you know an employer
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
do they have dress codes yeah they have
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
dress codes you know if they're
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
in a setting where they don't feel the
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
mask is appropriate um
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
you know that it's going to alarm i
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't know their preschoolers who are
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
trying to learn speech
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
my mind tried to think about who would
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
ever say that an employee can't wear
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
their mask and ppe to work i have not
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
heard of anyone
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
stepping into that
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
place and enforcing that on people when
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
they're when we are in the midst of a
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we do have a virus that is
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
making people very sick
 
01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
making people very sick
i

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
believe that employers
 
01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:24.790 align:start position:0%
believe that employers
will

01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
typically want to do what they can to
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
support their employees especially right
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
now when
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
people are desperate for good workers
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i think everyone's been very
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
fair and and cares about their employees
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
enough to say if you feel like you need
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
a face mask to keep yourself safe we're
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to support you in that but yet
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
they're not supporting the person who
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
says i feel like i'm harboring a bunch
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
of bacteria in this warm dark moist
 
01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.110 align:start position:0%
of bacteria in this warm dark moist
sugary

01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
sugary
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
air that's on this you know my
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
seven-year-old his mask comes home
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
stopping wet
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
and he got sick eight times last year
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
and developed a nervous tic because of
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
his mask reminders he's not given the
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
same liberty to make a choice
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
but i have not experienced an employer
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
saying you're not allowed to wear mass
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
care especially in today's environment
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
they would be crucified
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
but i i believe that employers should
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
not be messing with medical
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
interventions and i believe right now we
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
already have that you go to your hr and
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
you say have a medical condition ada i
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
need to wear a mask because i have
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
asthma i'm compromised
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
i know you don't want us to wear a mask
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
because you're conservative and you're
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
way over here and you don't want to hire
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
someone who's vaccinated i would say
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
that you know our our constitution i've
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
really read through some of our labor
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
laws that person would have a medical
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
justification to have that accommodation
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
made for them to be vaccinated to have
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
their mask i really feel like that's
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there any other
 
01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.270 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there any other
questions

01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much i do not
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
have any additional pink cards for house
 
01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.750 align:start position:0%

sorry the acoustics here aren't great we
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
all have masks on could you speak a
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
little closer to the microphone yeah um
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
my name is kendra goodwin i'm from
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
sandown new hampshire
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
and i've never done this before so it's
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
like nerve-wracking
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
but i'm a single mom of three and i
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
spent the entire summer
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
with anxiety and worrying about my job
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
and you know luckily they accepted my
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
my um religious exemption
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
but other people weren't as fortunate
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to say that
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think there should be
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination either way i agree you
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
know with that but if it's there's no
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination that way it has to be for
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
people that don't want it either
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
i personally have a 13 year old daughter
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
who is injured from a vaccine
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
she is up all night every night she's
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
sweats like seizure movements we have
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
been to every doctor
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
imaginable for four years and no one
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
knows what's wrong with her she was also
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with reactive arthritis which
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
is a side effect from vaccines and then
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
that turned into neurological issues she
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
can't be go to school she can't have a
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
normal life
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
so this is personal to me and that's
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
when i started
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know there's two sides to everything
 
01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.709 align:start position:0%
you know there's two sides to everything
and

01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
i think there needs to be open
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
discussion about these things and where
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
there's a risk
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
there should always be a choice whether
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
that be employers which is just at this
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
point an extension of the government
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
because they do whatever you know these
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
big corporations do whatever the
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
government tells them to do
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
work in the medical field i look at
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
hearts every day and i've seen
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking things that aren't
 
01:24:58.400 --> 01:24:59.910 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking things that aren't
reported

01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that aren't
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
reported my um
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
my cousin's daughter's teacher was just
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with gillian beret from the
 
01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.629 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with gillian beret from the
vaccine

01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:11.590 align:start position:0%
vaccine
my

01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
i've had patients
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
i've had patients come to me and they
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
say you know i've been short of breath
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
for three months as ever since i had
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
that vaccine i've never had this problem
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
before their d-dimers are through the
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
roof which indicate blood clotting and i
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
look at hearts and that causes pulmonary
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
hypertension and these people will die
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
from heart failure
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's a serious thing and it's something
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to have a choice about
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
and like i said a lot of these are never
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
reported because they don't they're like
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
oh it can't be from that the cdc says
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
you can only have reactions within 48
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
hours that's not true
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's not true at all and
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
with any bill coming up and i've never
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
paid attention to local politics i've
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
never been involved in any of this in my
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
life and i am now and
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
the last two years has opened my eyes to
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
anything it's just the utter corruption
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
so um i said this is personal to me
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
i have a vaccine or daughter and i just
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
whenever there is any type of risk there
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
has to be a choice regardless of
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
what legislation it is and i can tell
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
you that me and my family are paying
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
close attention and i don't you know i
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
voted vote republican down the line and
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
i will not do that anymore if people
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
don't stand up for our freedoms
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:33.199 align:start position:0%

01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%

01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is laura condon
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm from bedford
 
01:27:16.639 --> 01:27:17.910 align:start position:0%
and i'm from bedford
and

01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
sorry i was late i didn't get to hear
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
the introduction on this bill
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
but i understand that is it a
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned bill to provide
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
employees with choice when it comes to
 
01:27:28.719 --> 01:27:30.550 align:start position:0%
employees with choice when it comes to
vaccination

01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
but my concern with this bill and i ask
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
that an amendment be considered
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
to provide for non-discrimination of
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
those who choose not to be vaccinated
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
and not to wear this
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
personal protective equipment because
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
this bill simply protects those that do
 
01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.510 align:start position:0%
this bill simply protects those that do
choose

01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
choose
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
so i think it would be appropriate to
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
protect those
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
who choose not to avail themselves of of
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
those products or devices thank you very
 
01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.830 align:start position:0%
those products or devices thank you very
much

01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you are any questions for the
 
01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:06.149 align:start position:0%
thank you are any questions for the
speaker

01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much i have
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
no additional individuals to speak so
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
i'll close the hearing
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%

01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%

01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
or an applause down to a minimum
 
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
we are here in the chamber
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%

a minimum
um

01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce house bill 1210
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 1210 on its face is a
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
time warp bill the goal of this bill is
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
to go back before we politicized codefit
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
and the way businesses used to handle
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
things like medical vaccine exemption
 
01:45:10.639 --> 01:45:11.990 align:start position:0%
things like medical vaccine exemption
requests

01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
prior to covid businesses routinely
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
handled on a regular basis and dealt
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
with accommodation requests from
 
01:45:20.159 --> 01:45:22.709 align:start position:0%
with accommodation requests from
employees

01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
however now we step into a coveted world
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
and the biggest problem is government
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
decide to put its thumb on the scale
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
in these decisions that businesses have
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to covid we've had
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
things like the certain general come out
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
and decide and tell businesses that
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to investigate
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions and whether or not
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to be they're being abused
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
so i want you to think about that for a
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
minute the idea and concept that either
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
or your business is going to investigate
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
you to decide whether or not you're
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
religious enough or spiritual enough to
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
be entitled to a religious exemption
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
same goes with medical exemptions you
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
now have to while you're not asking for
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
an ada accommodation for a rant or a
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
stand-up desk or something that the
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
business would have to do a special
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
accommodation for you on
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
you're asking for just under medical
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
condition that i have i'm not able to
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
get my vaccine so therefore i want an
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
exemption except now the business is
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
requiring that you release your personal
 
01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.790 align:start position:0%
requiring that you release your personal
data

01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
your personal medical data to the
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
business to explain why you're entitled
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
medical request and then they'll measure
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
that as well decide whether or not they
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
think that your medical reason is good
 
01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:40.950 align:start position:0%
think that your medical reason is good
enough

01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
not to get a vaccine and to be entitled
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
this should be horrific for us to think
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
about that our businesses and our
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
government could potentially do this
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
so this bill looks to go back to prior
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
to code and go back to the standard we
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
used to have which is basically an
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
employee submits an exemption request
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
that exemption request is granted
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
the business then enters basically into
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the employee on what a
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation is
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
if they can't come to an accommodation
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
the business can fire the employee and
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
the employee can sue the business and
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
and say that they didn't offer me a
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation but that'll be
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
dealt with in the court system just like
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
it did prior to coded this is how we
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
handle things
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
again we go back to this idea
 
01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:27.990 align:start position:0%
again we go back to this idea
of

01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
measuring measuring medical entitlement
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
measuring religious entitlement
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
do we really want our business to do it
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
is there's a great article in the bia
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
magazine talking about how this is a
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
huge problem for businesses because
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about potential civil
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
rights violations now imagine a business
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
not granting religious exemptions
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
there are religions out there
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
that say you can't get vaccinated you
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get vaccinated a lot of this
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
is based on the concept of stem cell
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
research and abortion it's under a
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
foundation of their faith
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
imagine a business saying we're not
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
going to allow religious exemptions
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
where we're going to tighten up really
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
hard on our religious exemptions and
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
therefore certain religions basically
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
can't be employed
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
again this should be chilling this
 
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
should be a chilling idea that would
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
that we are going to allow businesses
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
decide what religions are allowed to
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
work in their environment which ones
 
01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:21.430 align:start position:0%
work in their environment which ones
aren't

01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
lastly the one object we're going to
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
talk about which is the new thing
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
because we generally medical and
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions were always granted
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
without without an issue it's only since
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
coveted and the federal government
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
decided to step on federal contractors
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
and step into the osha law and step into
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
the labor laws and create mandates which
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
have since been overturned as mandates
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
and step and threaten people's
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
livelihood having a job
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
threaten businesses ability to keep
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
federal contracts this is why this bill
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
is in front of you as i got from a
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that called me from the
 
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
lakes region who was extremely concerned
 
01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
about the federal contractor
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
requirements that he was going to lose
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
10 percent of his workforce and he was
 
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about how he was going to be
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
able to meet the federal mandate
 
01:49:05.590 --> 01:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
requiring it
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
and this is a simple answer
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
so we're going to talk just real quick
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
about the new edition that's in there
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
and that's conscientious objector which
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
is on sorry i'm trying to find my phone
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
excited that's some comments i want to
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
read so conscientious objector
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
so as we talk about individual rights i
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
go to the new hampshire constitution
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
because it's one of my favorite
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
documents to read read about
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
so you're going to hear about three
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
different articles within our part one
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
article three which is everyone likes to
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
cite and say this is why we should have
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
mandates article three says when men
 
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
enter into a state of society they
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
surrender up some of their natural
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
rights to that society in order to
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
ensure the protection of others and
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
without such equivalent the surrender is
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
void so that basically says
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
in order to be in a polite society we
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
have to give up some of our rights
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
however the constitution goes on
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
an article number four of the new
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience unalienable
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
among the natural rights
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
some are in their very nature
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
unalienable because no equivalent can be
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
given or received for them
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
of this right kind of rights is the
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
right of i'm sorry of this kind are the
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
rights of conscience
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i had to go look up what is
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
unalienable mean
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
so unalienable according to
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
us history.org which does a site on on
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
the u.s constitution's use of the word
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
unadill says
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
unalienable rights
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
that are mentioned in the declaration of
 
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.510 align:start position:0%
that are mentioned in the declaration of
independence

01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
independence
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
could just have been the word enabled
 
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
which means the same thing inaudible or
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
unailer refers to that which cannot be
 
01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:48.229 align:start position:0%
unailer refers to that which cannot be
given

01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
or taken away
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
it cannot take away the right of
 
01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.030 align:start position:0%
it cannot take away the right of
conscience

01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
so as people have
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
and i use the phrase organic lifestyle
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
right they have a they have a
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
philosophical belief in their life where
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
and my ex-wife is one of them who
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
believes that
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
they eat organic food they try to reduce
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of processed foods they eat
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
they don't take
 
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
they try all organic or health
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
related activities before they take a
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
prescription so again i'm one of these
 
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
people as well i i have a family history
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
of heart disease i went to my
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
cardiologist at 45 years old i did my
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
little treadmill test
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
and a doctor said well you don't have
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
any heart disease but i want you to take
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
the snap drug on a regular basis because
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
of your history my response was i don't
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
want to take a medication for the rest
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
of my life i want the chance to
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
do this naturally so what's the response
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
you have to do
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
i have to eat healthier and i have to
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
exercise so i eat healthy and i've
 
01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:46.550 align:start position:0%
exercise so i eat healthy and i've
exercised

01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
exercised
 
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
clean bill of health and my cardiologist
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
without the need to take
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
a drug for the rest of my life just as a
 
01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.310 align:start position:0%
a drug for the rest of my life just as a
precautionary

01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
precautionary
 
01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
so to me that's a consider the right of
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
conscious i didn't i wasn't forced that
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
drug but it was my choice my my personal
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
choice not to inject not to ingest a
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
chemical substance that would be
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
probably good for my health but i had
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
alternatives to do
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
so in this case i believe this is the
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
same exact thing we should not be
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
forcing people to do a mandate of
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination and especially when we talk
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
about and it's always going to be about
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
coping for a while but we talk about the
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine we know that it's not a
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
curative vaccine i think everybody
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
agrees with that point at this point
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
it's not curative it is mitigating and i
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
agree with that but it's not curative it
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't solve the problem it just
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
lessens the problem and while i think
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
that that's a good thing there are also
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
other ways that could be handled without
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
impinging on somebody's right of
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
conscience their religious beliefs or
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
their medical data
 
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.229 align:start position:0%
their medical data
so

01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
again i look at this bill and i say to
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
you that
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
this bill will help businesses
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
streamline processes it'll reduce
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
potential lawsuits because there's an
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
obligation now that they meet they
 
01:52:59.830 --> 01:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
accept the uh
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
religious exemption and negotiate just
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of a reasonable accommodation
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
and then lastly we have this issue of
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government these
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
federal contractors
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
so with this bill
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing lakes region could
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
implement a mandatory
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination process as required by the
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
federal government for for his federal
 
01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.470 align:start position:0%
federal government for for his federal
contracts

01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
but he can also turn around and follow
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
state law and accept
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
the exemption of his employees and be
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
consistent with both laws
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
and it allows that employer to be able
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
to manage his company do what he needs
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
to do for his employees and his job
 
01:53:37.599 --> 01:53:39.109 align:start position:0%
to do for his employees and his job
without

01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
losing workforce
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
so i know there's probably a lot of
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions i know there probably a lot of
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
people want to speak again i think this
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
is a common sense bill i think it
 
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
respects individual rights it respects
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
the business rights um and i think we
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
should i hope you recommend otp for this
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill happy to take any questions
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
by sherman seaworth followed by
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative proud
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
i heard some things you said in your
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that i want to kind of square
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
with the language of the bill you
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple times
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
a process of reasonable accommodation
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
and mentioned that so once an exemption
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
is granted it's still up to the employer
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the employee to find reasonable
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
accommodation and if that can't be
 
01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.149 align:start position:0%
accommodation and if that can't be
obtained

01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
obtained
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
the employer retains the right to
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
dismiss the employee
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill language it simply says
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
that the employer shall grant such
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
exemption so i'm kind of wondering at
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
what where in the process is the
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
employer protected
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
that if they can't
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely so
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
to answer your question or i think i can
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
answer your question that actually can
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
be found over in federal statutes that
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
talk about business mandates and it
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
talks about accommodations this came out
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
at a supreme court case
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
that says that businesses
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
have to if they have a mandate they have
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
to do accommodations they have to accept
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
exemptions and then those
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
but they can also set reasonable
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
accommodations was the language that's
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
used in the federal law
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative proud followed by
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%

representative line for taking my
 
01:55:33.119 --> 01:55:33.990 align:start position:0%
representative line for taking my
question

01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
do you think that in addition to
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
sorry do you think that in addition to
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
the direct mandates that are coming down
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
businesses are concerned that
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
whether they mandate on their own will
 
01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.189 align:start position:0%
whether they mandate on their own will
be

01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
looked on favorably or disfavorably in
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
any discretionary interaction with the
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
federal government or with other
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
officials and they're concerned
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
that if they don't require all their
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
employees be vaccinated or be strict
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
about religious exemptions they'll be
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
disfavored in their interactions with
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
so you know this is a hypothetical guess
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
right so again as a i would argue yes
 
01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
you're right you know we saw that osha
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
right tried to force down 100-plus
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
mandate right and that was what they
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
wanted and it wasn't until the supreme
 
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
court stepped in that that was stymied
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
from them
 
01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
um so do i think that if a businesses
 
01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:28.390 align:start position:0%
um so do i think that if a businesses
has

01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
a mandate will they be viewed more
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
favorably by the federal government sure
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
i think i think that that's just the
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
nature of unfortunately politics right
 
01:56:36.159 --> 01:56:37.030 align:start position:0%
nature of unfortunately politics right
now

01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:42.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
why did you choose section 141c instead
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
of 275 which is most
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
employee or employer protections located
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
at 275.
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
so the 141c language are communicable
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
diseases statutes and that's why i put
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
it in there because this is relevant
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
directly to where we have all of our
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
vaccination statutes it's where we have
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
all of our exemption statutes for
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
students in school
 
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
and all of our quarantining statutes are
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
in there so i felt that having it under
 
01:57:16.159 --> 01:57:16.790 align:start position:0%
in there so i felt that having it under
the

01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
the immunization statute
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
was the best place to do it
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um would you be
 
01:57:26.669 --> 01:57:26.679 align:start position:0%
opposed to having it
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
started under 275 colon three
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
which uh procuring employment and
 
01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%

would you be opposed if this was moved
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
to there
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%

01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%

we do not like to get in between
the

bureaucrat or politicians purview to
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
get involved in
 
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
so how do i as much as i love what
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do how do i reconcile
 
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
the private business
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
and your bill
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
if copenhagen had happened i wouldn't
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
file this bill right so this bill is
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
about the influence of federal
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
government is exacting on businesses to
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
make it so that businesses
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
basically no longer have a choice
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want to instead of
 
01:59:58.229 --> 01:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
it being their business decision it's
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
the federal government specific uh
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
decision and so the goal of this is
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
in those situations where the employer
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
is basically stuck between the the
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
federal government up top telling you're
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
going to do this as part of a labor law
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
how can the state mitigate and help that
 
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
business and so i look at this bill as a
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
mitigation bill for businesses that
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
we're trying to help them by saying that
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
we understand that there's a workforce
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
issue and we're going to try and give
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
you an out if you want to use it you're
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
welcome to use it and and this is what
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
this is how how you can use it so you
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
can meet that federal requirement and
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
you can also meet the state requirement
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
and and keep your workforce in place i
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
would rather not
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
represent turcotte i'm just like you i
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to impose any more rules and
 
02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
regulations on business than i
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely have to the problem is that
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
businesses are now and sorry dave
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
businesses are starting to become the
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
shell of the federal government they're
 
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
forcing down federal government
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
regulations onto their employees and
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
is what you're attempting to do with
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
this strictly from mandates sent down
 
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
from the federal government alone that
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
would be question one the second
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
let's forget about covet let's just say
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
there's something else i'm an employer
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
and i tell my employees i want you to do
 
02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:25.350 align:start position:0%
and i tell my employees i want you to do
x

02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
x
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
forget about vaccines
 
02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:29.270 align:start position:0%
forget about vaccines
i

02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
still see i don't understand how this is
 
02:01:32.719 --> 02:01:36.790 align:start position:0%
still see i don't understand how this is
not

02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats and politicians getting in
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
between the middle of an employer and
 
02:01:41.199 --> 02:01:42.149 align:start position:0%
between the middle of an employer and
again

02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm on the tip of the spear on this one
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
so i understand it but i just having
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
trouble still reconciling that
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
so i guess if you if you were to how can
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
i word this politely
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
if i agree with you i i again i would i
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
would not have filed this bill if we
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
didn't have some of the problems we're
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
having so i chair the hb 220 committee
 
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
on medical interventions
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i heard two and a half days of
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
testimony public testimony never mind
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
the two days of testimony of agencies
 
02:02:11.669 --> 02:02:11.679 align:start position:0%
and businesses but two and a half days
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
of public testimony of time after time
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
again where businesses stepped on
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
citizens either religious rights or they
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
stepped on the conscientious objector
 
02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:22.950 align:start position:0%
stepped on the conscientious objector
rights

02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
so and in almost every single case the
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
reason the business stepped on it was
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
because there was a push down from above
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
and it was a problem
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
given the given the weight of or given
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
the decision am i going to protect the
 
02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
business right or am i going to protect
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
an individual right i'm going to fall
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
for the individual every single time
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
right i'm going to protect the
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
individuals right and not have business
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
force stuff down their throat um so if
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's a case of in our constitution
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's clear the conscience the right of
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
conscience is extremely laid out it's
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's called out separately as an
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
inalienable right and i recognize that
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
some people believe the constitution is
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
between the government and its citizen
 
02:03:00.070 --> 02:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
versus business and a citizen i get that
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
but in this case where i think that it's
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
a legitimate we're not asking them to
 
02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.229 align:start position:0%
a legitimate we're not asking them to
um

02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
blanket granted we're just saying you
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
have to grant it and then work your
 
02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
accommodations the way we did before we
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
politicized covet again this is
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
what a lot of people
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
need to understand is that
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
before kobe this was a routine event in
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
a business and it rarely raised any
 
02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:22.390 align:start position:0%
a business and it rarely raised any
concerns

02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.510 align:start position:0%
concerns
um

02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
and now because of the politicization
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
we've done of public health and
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
politicization being done of covid
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
now it's an issue and now people are
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're pitting the government
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
against business and business against
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
the individual and i don't want to see
 
02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:37.510 align:start position:0%
the individual and i don't want to see
that

02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up problem
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm good mr chairman thank you very much
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
sullivan you recognize
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and taking my question
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
in your testimony
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
you uh referenced
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
the need
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
for individuals to sometimes give up
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
some of their rights
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
for the sake of uh the society
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
um and you also referenced the
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
conscientious uh rights the inalienable
 
02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:12.950 align:start position:0%
conscientious uh rights the inalienable
rights

02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.870 align:start position:0%
rights
um

02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh framers of the constitution
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps thought that there needed to be
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
a balance between the two that
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
you had to figure out
 
02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:29.589 align:start position:0%
you had to figure out
what

02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
society really needs in order to figure
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
out whether or not rights need to be
 
02:04:34.239 --> 02:04:36.069 align:start position:0%
out whether or not rights need to be
relinquished

02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
relinquished
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan and i guess to
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
i find it uh what's the word i want to
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
use extremely important to say that the
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire framers of the
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
constitution specifically called out the
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
right of conscience
 
02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:54.870 align:start position:0%
right of conscience
over

02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.310 align:start position:0%
over
um

02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
the the third section which says you
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
have to give some up and he specifically
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
called the right of conscience
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
unalienable meaning that which would not
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
be given or taken away
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
if they had meant not to make it to make
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
the right of conscience as a as one of
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
those rights that you can give up in
 
02:05:13.199 --> 02:05:14.470 align:start position:0%
those rights that you can give up in
society

02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
society
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh in order to participate in a society
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't erode section four they
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been needed they would
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
have just left section three all by
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
itself as a standalone saying sometimes
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
you have to give up rights to be in
 
02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
society but then they went on and
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
specifically called out the right of
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
conscience and specifically said it was
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
unalienable cannot be given or taken
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
away i think that speaks volumes to the
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
intent of what they meant
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:42.079 --> 02:05:43.109 align:start position:0%
thank you
the

02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
framers of the constitution did not
 
02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:45.990 align:start position:0%
framers of the constitution did not
however

02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
determine that the right
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
of an employer to require a vaccine
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
was an inalienable right
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
this bill makes it ineligible but
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
not the constitution
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
so i guess i disagree it would not be
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
illegal for an employer to put a mandate
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
on right this bill does not make it
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
illegal for an employer to set a mandate
 
02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
it just makes the employer also be
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
responsible to the individual rights
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
including the right of conscience of its
 
02:06:14.159 --> 02:06:17.270 align:start position:0%
including the right of conscience of its
workforce

02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville you're
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative lang for appearing here
 
02:06:26.069 --> 02:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
this bill if this bill were to pass and
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
let's say a
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
a an employee
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
who let's say was working a cash
 
02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:36.950 align:start position:0%
who let's say was working a cash
register

02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
register
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
applied for this the exemption
 
02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
applied for this the exemption
and

02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
it would be granted per the terms of the
 
02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:46.310 align:start position:0%
it would be granted per the terms of the
bill

02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
said well my customers or other people
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
working here are concerned and so that's
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
fine but you're going to have to work in
 
02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
the back
 
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
rather than on the register
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
would would that implicate anything in
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
your bill would that create a violation
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
or a right in the employee
 
02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:09.270 align:start position:0%
or a right in the employee
or

02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
would it involve what is intended to be
 
02:07:13.589 --> 02:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
covered by this bill
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question actually
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
falls in line with a federal court case
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
so it was a federal court case in in uh
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
that was about uh accommodations what is
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
the reasonable accommodations or not
 
02:07:25.589 --> 02:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
this in this particular case it was
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
about healthcare and it was a nurse and
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
the nurse was a scheduling nurse who did
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
who just called patients to schedule
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
operations schedule things
 
02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:36.870 align:start position:0%
operations schedule things
the

02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:38.719 align:start position:0%
hospital put a mandate in
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
the nurse asked for an exemption
 
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
they outright denied her
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
she sued saying that they didn't do a
 
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation for me and she
 
02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation for me and she
won

02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
won
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
and the reason she won is because
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
that job function had no bearing on
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
patients there was no there was no
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
threat to patients there was no threat
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
to the job force
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
so i i use it again in a health care
 
02:08:03.669 --> 02:08:03.679 align:start position:0%
setting which is probably the easiest
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
one to understand when it talks to
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations is i use an
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
ecology board cancer ward right it is
 
02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable to say that people
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
in a cancer ward must be vaccinated
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
because cancer patients have a have a
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
compromised immune system we know that
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a life-threatening
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
situation if they get sick
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
so and i know laura's probably staring
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
at daggers at me right now but but i
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a reasonable reasonable to
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
say that a nurse in a cancer ward must
 
02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
and if they didn't want to be vaccinated
 
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
and filed for an exemption it's
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
completely okay to say to that nurse
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
you can't work in a college award
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
because of the threat to the patient but
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
you can still be a nurse and you'll work
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
over in podiatry
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
right where the threat to the patient is
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
significantly less that is a reasonable
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
accommodation i believe and i think that
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
would have won but the outright saying
 
02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:54.639 align:start position:0%
you can't be a nurse is not is not a
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation so
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
um i i think that sort of answers your
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
question that there are reasonable
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
accommodations employer can make and
 
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's moving an employee
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
whatever other i can't think of whatever
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
other things they might do but what if
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
they want to move an employee to a
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
non-facing uh you know customer facing
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
position again as long as you don't
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
impact their wages which is not a
 
02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation cut their cut
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
their salary give them a lesser position
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
then yeah that's going to be deemed a
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
are there any additional questions for
 
02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
am i incorrect in thinking that people
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
who have
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
cancer or
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
other immune suppression problems may
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
also have
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
feed problems and need to see a
 
02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
podiatrist and how would they know
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
that the person who would be interacting
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
with them was not vaccinated and thus
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
not protecting them to the degree that
 
02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
they could
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
sure great and i i guess what i would
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
say is that the answer is right on your
 
02:10:02.639 --> 02:10:03.589 align:start position:0%
say is that the answer is right on your
face

02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
face
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
so if i had cancer and i was concerned
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
about going someplace i take my own
 
02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
about going someplace i take my own
precautions

02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
precautions
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
to deal with my own risks right if i'm
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
going to go to the podiatrist and i wear
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
a mask if that if i'm concerned i have
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
cancer and i think that's going to be an
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
issue i can take my health and my
 
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility among
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
among myself without impacting another
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
person right i can wear a mask i can
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
wear i can get the n95 mask i can pay
 
02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
extra to go get the
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
fitted masks and then i'm protected from
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
that right and i don't have to impose
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
upon you
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
because of yours because of your
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
sickness to uh or because i'm sick i
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%

care of that responsibility on my own
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that answers your
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
question but i think it goes both
 
02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:47.910 align:start position:0%
question but i think it goes both
directions

02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%

02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
by kate frey
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
mr duvet thank you mr chair members of
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
dave juven senior vice president for
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
public policy with the business and
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
industry association
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
i initially arrived here this morning
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
with the intention to oppose this bill
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
our concern
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
was that it places employers that under
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
that are under federal mandates meaning
 
02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
those employers that receive medicaid
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
funding or those employers that have
 
02:11:36.239 --> 02:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
funding or those employers that have
federal

02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
those employees that are employers that
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
have federal contracts are under a
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate that they're expected to
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
adhere to i don't think that makes them
 
02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
shills i think that employers around the
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
country have for many years been
 
02:11:58.550 --> 02:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
obligated to follow regulations they
 
02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
come down from the federal government
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
and i felt like this bill was getting in
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
the way
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
i had a very
 
02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:06.390 align:start position:0%
i had a very
cordial

02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
cordial
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
conversation with representative lang
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsor before the hearing
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
and he explained what he was trying to
 
02:12:13.199 --> 02:12:14.069 align:start position:0%
and he explained what he was trying to
do

02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
i i have to tell the committee i'm not
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
entirely convinced that that is what it
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
will do but it was plausible enough to
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
ask the if he would accept an invitation
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
to come to the bia to talk to our
 
02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
federal labor attorneys who are experts
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
02:12:36.229 --> 02:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
relating to medical exemptions
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions
 
02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:39.109 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions
and

02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
that third area conscientious objection
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
objectors which is my
 
02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
real concern because the federal mandate
 
02:12:48.550 --> 02:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak to that
 
02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
so there's a courtesy to him i told him
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
that we would remain neutral on this
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
bill until we had a chance to have that
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
conversation together and so that's
 
02:12:59.189 --> 02:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
where we're at
 
02:13:01.109 --> 02:13:01.119 align:start position:0%
representative lang has been kind enough
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
we'll be getting together over the next
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
week to two weeks to have that
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
conversation at that point i may be
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
reaching out to the community with with
 
02:13:11.589 --> 02:13:11.599 align:start position:0%
further information
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'd be happy to answer any
 
02:13:13.119 --> 02:13:14.069 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'd be happy to answer any
questions

02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
seaworth followed by sullivan
 
02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
duvet for testifying today i'm wondering
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
if um
 
02:13:29.109 --> 02:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
as you heard from my previous question
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
i'm interested in this
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation and exactly how
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
that would imply to
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
employers i'm wondering if you had
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
already discussed that issue and if not
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
i would encourage that as
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
you continue to meet on it you help us
 
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
understand that area yeah i thought your
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
observation about
 
02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
whether the bill could be clarified to
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
to understand that it is calling for a
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation it is just not
 
02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.229 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation it is just not
the

02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
employer's obligation to
 
02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:02.149 align:start position:0%
employer's obligation to
to

02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
accede to the request was a good one
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
employers are are very well versed
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
in dealing with reasonable
 
02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
accommodations and a lot of other areas
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
it is not uncommon at all
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
so i guess my overall concern about that
 
02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
is less than perhaps
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
yours might be but i think it is an area
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's worth at least exploring
 
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
my major concern was
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
that those employers who are under the
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
federal mandate
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
could be in a very tough position if
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
this law
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
is prohibiting them from from
 
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
complying with the federal mandate i
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
know representative lang
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
believes that it it doesn't and that
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
makes it good for employers
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
i just need a little more confirmation
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'd like to second
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative seaworth's um concern
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
because i don't i'm not confident that
 
02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:02.069 align:start position:0%
because i don't i'm not confident that
that

02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation would be
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
required under this bill
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
and would be comforted in knowing
 
02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
whether it would or would not
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and i also trust that you will be
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%

02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%

02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
if passed this amendment would tie the

hands of these entities
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
and limit their ability to enforce

02:17:59.349 --> 02:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
medical exemptions one necessary
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
component of vaccine policies however an
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
objection based on conscientious or
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
philosophical reasons essentially
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
allowing an easy opt-out to anyone would
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
reverse the progress new hampshire has
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
made in defeating this pandemic and
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%

02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%

society of america studies demonstrate
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
that it's that the easier it is to
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
receive an exemption the higher the rate
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
of exemptions in particular states as
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
the number of extensions increase the
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
risk of the vaccine preventable disease
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
also increases therefore states should
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
make the effort to minimize the number
 
02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.349 align:start position:0%

thank you representative
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:58.870 align:start position:0%
my question
is

02:19:58.870 --> 02:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
why did you include a clinical sites on
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
line four in the first part of your bill
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
thank you you talk about the it includes
 
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
institutions that provide clinical sites
 
02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
or educational
 
02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:13.910 align:start position:0%
or educational
yes

02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so that was
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
a very specific um ask that i got i i
 
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
worked with i got a lot of phone calls
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
after house bill 220
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
was put into law and our university
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
systems are are
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
obligated to house bill 220 which says
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
that government cannot mandate
 
02:20:30.319 --> 02:20:32.469 align:start position:0%
that government cannot mandate
vaccinations

02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
the problem we got was our nursing
 
02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
programs and our college systems was our
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
nursing programs do clinical testing at
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals they do clinical surveys
 
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
walkthroughs and that kind of thing
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
so i got a phone call from a bunch of
 
02:20:46.399 --> 02:20:47.349 align:start position:0%
so i got a phone call from a bunch of
people

02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
saying i have a problem i can't get my
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
clinicals done as a nurse a nursing
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
student because the hospital is
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
requiring and therefore the university
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
is now saying i have to have my
 
02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:57.349 align:start position:0%
is now saying i have to have my
vaccination

02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
02:20:59.910 --> 02:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
and so the idea behind that inclusion
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
was just that was that i i tried to work
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
with concord hospital
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
to work out to work out a problem for
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
nhgi specifically was the first one i
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
went to
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
where the nurses needed to do clinical
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
site training at the hospital but were
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
didn't want to get vaccinated and the
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
state couldn't require them to be
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but they couldn't pass their
 
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
class unless they had the clinical so
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
they were kind of in this catch-22 phase
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
so the idea behind this was that things
 
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
like concord hospital or any clinical
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
care could be a nursing home or
 
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
something else that may have a vaccine
 
02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:32.790 align:start position:0%
something else that may have a vaccine
mandate

02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
would again if a student asked to be
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
exempt from the from the mandate would
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
be exempted from it but the hospital
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
could require accommodations and it may
 
02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
be that again you can't tour the
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
oncology board right you're going to go
 
02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
over to podiatry you're going to go over
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
to a different board sorry i don't keep
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
meaning to pick up podiatry but um
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
but again you know the idea was to allow
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
our nursing students we're in a nursing
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
crisis to be able to complete their
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
training get certified as a nurse and
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
then deal with those once they become an
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
employer they can deal with an employee
 
02:22:04.950 --> 02:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
basis what hospital they choose to work
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
at what clinical setting they choose to
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
work out but we need to be able to allow
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
our student nurses the ability to
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
complete their degree programs
 
02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
and that was why that was specifically
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
inserted again with the idea concord
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
hospital originally loved the idea that
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
ghosted me refused to return my phone
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
call and so i i was going along the idea
 
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
of doing accommodations and the
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
president of the hospital was responsive
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
to that he went to doctor's chief
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
medical officer and then i never had
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
another phone call i couldn't get a
 
02:22:34.870 --> 02:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
return text message nothing so i
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
included that in my statement and say
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
that hospitals must also allow for
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation for nursing
 
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
students so they can complete their
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
degree program
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:22:47.469 --> 02:22:47.479 align:start position:0%

association and i'm here representing
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
all of our state's hospitals
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
the nhh is opposed to house bill 1210
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation would prevent private
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
employers from requiring vaccines of
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
their employees as a condition of
 
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
employment without offering exemptions
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
for medical religious or conscientious

for medical religious or conscientious
objection

objection
 
02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
hb 1210 would also as we just heard
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
prevent hospitals that provide clinical
 
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
rotations for training of a wide variety
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
of clinicians from requiring that those
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
students adhere to the evidence-based
 
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
policies and protocols that they have
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
established for the health and safety of
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
their patients workforce and students
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
who are training there hb 1210 would
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
essentially render moot any requirements
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
that an employer has determined are in
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
the best interest of those they serve by
 
02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
simply saying no to the vaccine
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
requirement on the grounds of a
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection declaration the
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital association its
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
member hospitals announced in august of
 
02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
last year a consensus statement in
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
support of requiring our healthcare
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
workforce to be vaccinated against cova
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
19 in order to protect the health and
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
safety of our patients our staff and our
 
02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
communities hospitals have announced
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
their own individual policies and have
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
been implementing them without with
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
robust education for their staff about
 
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
the important benefits of the vaccine in
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
doing so the hospitals have sought to be
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
flexible and have complied with all
 
02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
relevant state and federal guidelines
 
02:24:09.429 --> 02:24:09.439 align:start position:0%

dedicated healthcare workers who come to
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
work in them every day have been on the

front lines of the pandemic for almost
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
two years
 
02:24:20.309 --> 02:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
the decision to require their employees
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated against coba 19 as i
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
said was done to ensure the health and
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
safety of their patients their workforce
 
02:24:27.429 --> 02:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
in their communities they have seen
 
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
firsthand the devastation that cova 19
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
can have on their patients especially
 
02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
those who are unvaccinated while we have
 
02:24:35.270 --> 02:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
seen more breakthrough cases impacting
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
those who have been vaccinated or
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
hospitalized those on the front lines
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
tell us over and over the patients who
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
are the most severely ill intubated and
 
02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
in the intensive care unit are those
 
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
that are unvaccinated
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals have an inherent
 
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect the health and
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
safety of their patients who by their
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
very nature are very ill and the coba 19
 
02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine is the most effective way we can
 
02:24:59.110 --> 02:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
do that the vaccines approved for use in
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
the united states are safe and highly
 
02:25:02.309 --> 02:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
effective in preventing infection
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%

02:25:04.319 --> 02:25:05.190 align:start position:0%

death
 
02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
studies have shown that unvaccinated
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
individuals are at a fivefold higher
 
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
risk of infection from coba 19 and
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
10-fold higher risk of dying from hope
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%

workers from communicable diseases is
 
02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
not new for hospitals in new hampshire
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals are required vaccination
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
against several communicable and deadly
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%

02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely the right thing to do for the
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
health and safety of our patients our

the vast majority of hospital staff have

been vaccinated against coca-19 or
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
received exemptions and work and we've
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
heard from many healthcare workers who
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
support the vaccine requirements to
 
02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
protect their health and that of their

02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate i thank you
 
02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to share our views

and i'd be happy to respond to any
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have

thank you mr chairman thank you for your

thank you mr chairman thank you for your
testimony

02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that the hospital
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
association or the individual hospitals
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
keep numbers on the number of employees
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
percentage that are vaccinated and such
 
02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:25.910 align:start position:0%
percentage that are vaccinated and such
and

02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
if you do so
 
02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
would you also be able to provide
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
some numbers that would say what
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of those previously
 
02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:34.469 align:start position:0%
percentage of those previously
vaccinated

02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
employees ended up becoming infected
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
with colgan 19. i don't have that
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
information but what i can share is as
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals have implemented their
 
02:26:45.270 --> 02:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
policies over the past several months
 
02:26:47.670 --> 02:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
some are just going into effect over the
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
next several days
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
we have been trying to understand what
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
the impact has been on their workforce
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
and as we understand as of right now
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
fewer than one percent of
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
the workforce and health hospital health
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
care workforce has been separated for
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
failure to comply with those requirement
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
policies so it's a very small number of
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
people who have been impacted we don't
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
want to lose anyone as you know we have
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
a workforce shortage hospitals are
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
stressed um incredibly challenged at
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
this time dealing with the current surge
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
in coba 19 and we need every employee
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
but we also need those employees to be
 
02:27:25.439 --> 02:27:26.389 align:start position:0%
but we also need those employees to be
safe

02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
safe
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
to be certain that we're providing the
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
highest quality safest care for our
 
02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:32.950 align:start position:0%
highest quality safest care for our
patients

02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:33.990 align:start position:0%
patients
follow-up

02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thanks again um
 
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
that was a very nice answer
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you didn't answer my
 
02:27:39.359 --> 02:27:40.630 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you didn't answer my
question

02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:27:42.389 --> 02:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
maybe the question i don't i don't have
 
02:27:44.309 --> 02:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
that data to ship
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
maybe my new question would be could you
 
02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
get us the data on what percentage of
 
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
those that you required vaccinations on
 
02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
becoming infected with covid
 
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly look at that i don't
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
know that i'll be able to answer that
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
question i will share
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
in fact the
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
wall street journal today had an article
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
sharing cdc data that demonstrated the
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of
 
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
breakthrough infections that we were
 
02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
seeing currently versus during the delta

our colleges have successful processes
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
in place based on these standards
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
that allow students to request

positive history of managing exemptions
 
02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:29.520 align:start position:0%

back there he's 85 years old
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
um the reason i'm pushing for this
 
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
exemption is because
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere you look turn read mainstream
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
media even our own new hampshire.gov
 
02:31:20.309 --> 02:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
websites tell us how safe this vaccine
 
02:31:20.319 --> 02:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
websites tell us how safe this vaccine
is

02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:31:22.389 --> 02:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
it's not safe
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
my dad got the vaccine in august
 
02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%

02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%

goes unconscious doesn't remember
 
02:31:36.790 --> 02:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
blacking out doesn't remember anything
 
02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
thankfully his girlfriend came
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
downstairs found him called
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%

02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:44.309 align:start position:0%

02:31:44.309 --> 02:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
does all the tests sends him home a day
 
02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:48.309 align:start position:0%
does all the tests sends him home a day
later

02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
coincidence maybe
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
maybe not
 
02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
force people to get something that's not
 
02:31:57.990 --> 02:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
safe whether it's one or twenty thousand
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
like bears says people are dying from
 
02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.000 align:start position:0%

and have asked the association to oppose
 
02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
right now the only exemptions that the
 
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
cms regulations allow for
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
are religious and medical there is no
 
02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
conscientious exemption and we feel that
 
02:34:41.349 --> 02:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
would set state policy and federal
 
02:34:41.359 --> 02:34:42.469 align:start position:0%
would set state policy and federal
policy

02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
against each other putting us in the
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
position of having to choose which
 
02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
policy we're going to follow
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh that could result if we chose to
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
follow state policy the feds taking away
 
02:34:57.830 --> 02:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
our medicaid money which as you know the
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
counties are responsible for paying the
 
02:35:02.790 --> 02:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
non-federal share of long-term care in
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
this state if the rest of that money
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
goes away
 
02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
and you're probably looking over 100
 
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars where are those funds
 
02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
going to come from because the counties
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
are protected by a cap
 
02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
that means the state would have to come
 
02:35:18.469 --> 02:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
up with those money so we are very
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about this bill we are having
 
02:35:21.990 --> 02:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
to work with representative lang if you
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
02:35:25.750 --> 02:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
make the language so that it fits with
 
02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
something that our nursing home
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
administrators are comfortable with and
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
with that chairman i will conclude my
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
testimony i'm happy to take any
 
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee has
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%

02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:37.680 align:start position:0%

02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
one question and
 
02:35:47.349 --> 02:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
in my current situation i i've run into
 
02:35:49.110 --> 02:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
issue that i keep going through in my
 
02:35:52.469 --> 02:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
head and that is
 
02:35:54.389 --> 02:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
you have a medical exemption
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
i will be working
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
with individuals who have those
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions so they do not have a vaccine
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
can you
 
02:36:12.790 --> 02:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
tell me what the difference is between
 
02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
an unvaccinated individual with a
 
02:36:15.359 --> 02:36:16.469 align:start position:0%
an unvaccinated individual with a
medical

02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:36:18.389 --> 02:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
exemption an unvaccinated individual

with a religious exemption and
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
somebody with a conscientious objection
 
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
can you tell me the difference thank you
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
for the question representative i think
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's a question for the federal
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
government and i'm prepared to answer at
 
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:36.240 align:start position:0%

yes sir being enforced through cms
 
02:37:18.070 --> 02:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
yes we speak to them regularly about the
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
cms mandate
 
02:37:23.910 --> 02:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville
 
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:37:30.070 --> 02:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
testifying we've had some testimony
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
already that an increase in opportunity
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
for exemptions
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
increases the number that are sought
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
and i also understand that the nursing
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
homes have a great concern about
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
availability of employees in this
 
02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
staffing challenge time
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
is your association concerned
 
02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:54.790 align:start position:0%
is your association concerned
that

02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
the increase in exemptions sought and
 
02:37:57.120 --> 02:37:58.389 align:start position:0%
the increase in exemptions sought and
granted

02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
granted
 
02:37:58.399 --> 02:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
granted
would

02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
threaten the
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
staffing issue by
 
02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:07.030 align:start position:0%
staffing issue by
deterring

02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
new employees or driving existing
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
employees away by virtue of the
 
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
increased risk
 
02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative so i will tell you that
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
rockingham and merrimack county nursing
 
02:38:20.550 --> 02:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
homes both did institute a mandate
 
02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
before the cms guidelines came into
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
effect and our experience was that we
 
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
probably lost 10 or less employees as a
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
result of that policy change over those
 
02:38:34.950 --> 02:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
count over those two counties that were
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
unable to be accommodated with the
 
02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that mike my question
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
though also if unless i misunderstood
 
02:38:48.870 --> 02:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
your answer was about those who would be
 
02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
less inclined to work there because of
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
the fear
 
02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
of for additional exposure to
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
covet or other disease from unvaccinated
 
02:38:58.640 --> 02:38:59.670 align:start position:0%
covet or other disease from unvaccinated
persons

02:38:59.670 --> 02:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
persons
 
02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative i will say that we had a
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage before koben
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
copenhagen's made it worse
 
02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative followed by seaworth
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:17.429 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:39:17.429 --> 02:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
a moment ago
 
02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:22.389 align:start position:0%
a moment ago
that

02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:26.309 --> 02:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
to not follow the federal guidelines
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
would result in possibly federal money
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
not being expended
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
so would i take that and correct me if
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong in this assumption
 
02:39:38.550 --> 02:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
what i take that to mean is is if you
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't do what the government tells you
 
02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
which could lead you to being injured or
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
dying they will take more money away
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
from you to make sure that people really
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
are injured and dying is that what
 
02:39:52.230 --> 02:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
you're basically saying here uh thank
 
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative i
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
think that is also a question for the
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
federal government to answer and not
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
make we just enforce the policies
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
could i get the number
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
yes paul could i get the number that i
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
could call on that i would be happy to
 
02:40:08.550 --> 02:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
connect you with someone who could get
 
02:40:10.150 --> 02:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
you in touch with cms but i can't
 
02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
guarantee an answer
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:14.630 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you

answering another question
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
you had talked about the small number of
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
employees at two counties
 
02:40:29.349 --> 02:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
that had instituted
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
the mandates early
 
02:40:35.110 --> 02:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i believe you said that in some or
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
all of those cases they did
 
02:40:40.630 --> 02:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
apply for either a medical or religious
 
02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:42.150 align:start position:0%
apply for either a medical or religious
exemption

02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
and yet this ability inability to
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
provide reasonable accommodation still
 
02:40:49.269 --> 02:40:49.279 align:start position:0%
resulted in their dismissal thank you
 
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
for the question representative um i
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that um i don't
 
02:40:57.670 --> 02:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
know whether or not specific employees
 
02:41:01.269 --> 02:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
applied for an exemption and were denied
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
that is just information i do not have
 
02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative proud
 
02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
so you've said that you are concerned
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
about losing funding if you do not
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
follow this new cms rule
 
02:41:24.309 --> 02:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
and that makes me think back to
 
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
almost a decade ago when
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
the federal obamacare law was passed and
 
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
there was a requirement to expand
 
02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid and that went up in the courts
 
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
and it was decided that
 
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government couldn't require
 
02:41:39.830 --> 02:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
or set down new rules on state
 
02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:41.030 align:start position:0%
or set down new rules on state
governments

02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
governments
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
and that there that set up the whole
 
02:41:44.469 --> 02:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
structure of expanded non-expanded
 
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
states and states could continue to
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
follow the old rules without threat of
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
loss of funding i believe the court
 
02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't know that was national
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
federation of independent businesses via
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
sibulous in 2012
 
02:41:57.670 --> 02:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
is there a reason that you see the
 
02:41:59.830 --> 02:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
situation now as different from that
 
02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
that the county governments couldn't
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
continue to follow the old rules and
 
02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:03.750 align:start position:0%
continue to follow the old rules and
reject

02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
reject
 
02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
this new change that cm is putting down
 
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
and still retain the funding they had
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
before that
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
question i can't speak to the obamacare
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
piece that's not something i'm familiar
 
02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:14.389 align:start position:0%
piece that's not something i'm familiar
with

02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:42:17.110 --> 02:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
but um i will say that the supreme court
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
just did uphold the cms mandate in
 
02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
federal court
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
requiring us to
 
02:42:26.790 --> 02:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
have a vaccine policy with just the
 
02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
religious and medical exemptions
 
02:42:33.190 --> 02:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
see no additional questions thank you
 
02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
folks as i know some of the members
 
02:42:40.389 --> 02:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
we are going to continue through here
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i do have a number of
 
02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
more pink cards if you need to step out
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
and grab something to eat please feel
 
02:42:47.349 --> 02:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
free to do so i just don't want everyone
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
to go at once um
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that but i know some of you i
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't want anyone to pass out on me here
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
so if you need to get something to eat
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
or drink feel free
 
02:43:01.110 --> 02:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
condon you're recognized
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
my name is laura condon i'm from bedford
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm a volunteer with the national
 
02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine information center we are a
 
02:43:13.990 --> 02:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
that serves as an educational
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
my microphone is dynamic i as an
 
02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
educational resource and advocacy
 
02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:23.349 align:start position:0%
educational resource and advocacy
organization

02:43:23.349 --> 02:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
and as such we have a long-standing
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
tradition of never supporting any
 
02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates anywheres
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so if i were to wear that hat today
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
i would be opposing this bill
 
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
but i'm taking off that hat and i'm
 
02:43:41.349 --> 02:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
putting on my hat as an individual
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
because i like dave
 
02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:44.710 align:start position:0%
because i like dave
juve

02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
juve
 
02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
spoke to representative tim lang earlier
 
02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:48.550 align:start position:0%
spoke to representative tim lang earlier
today

02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
and indeed this is very much a
 
02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
compromise bill recognizing both sides
 
02:43:54.630 --> 02:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
of the issue
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
and in today's environment we need
 
02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
compromise more than ever in our
 
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
communities and our state and our
 
02:44:02.469 --> 02:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
and we would be smart to adopt this bill
 
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
this bill will resolve staffing issues
 
02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
it provides appropriate medical
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
religious and personal privacy
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
businesses are not in a position
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
to make determinations on personal
 
02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:19.910 align:start position:0%
to make determinations on personal
matters

02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
matters
 
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
that are medical or religious or indeed
 
02:44:24.469 --> 02:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
deeply personal
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
and this bill would relieve them of that
 
02:44:26.319 --> 02:44:27.269 align:start position:0%
and this bill would relieve them of that
burden

02:44:27.269 --> 02:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
burden
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
and that responsibility
 
02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
accepting exemptions
 
02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:33.429 align:start position:0%
accepting exemptions
exemptions

02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
will allow businesses to maintain a
 
02:44:38.710 --> 02:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
hundred percent compliance with vaccine
 
02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
mandates because those mandates measure
 
02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
who is gotten the shots or
 
02:44:47.269 --> 02:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
is in compliance with an exemption
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
policy and if you can answer yes to both
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
of those then you're 100 in compliance
 
02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
and so this would provide just that
 
02:44:58.830 --> 02:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful compromise there
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
um i also would like to mention that
 
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
exemptions don't change vaccine
 
02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:05.830 align:start position:0%
exemptions don't change vaccine
decisions

02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's no one that i know of that
 
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
knowing that they could get an exemption
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
and they wanted a vaccine or all the
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
sudden gonna say you know what i don't
 
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
want that vaccine anymore
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
and there's no one who says i don't want
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
that vaccine that is all of a sudden is
 
02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
going to get a vaccine voluntarily
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
so this really is a reasonable
 
02:45:26.399 --> 02:45:27.590 align:start position:0%
so this really is a reasonable
compromise

02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
02:45:29.590 --> 02:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
one other thing i just want to add to
 
02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
the conversation here
 
02:45:33.349 --> 02:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
that i'm surprised that there are any
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
businesses that would unilaterally
 
02:45:38.070 --> 02:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
impose vaccine mandates
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
while there are some businesses that are
 
02:45:42.550 --> 02:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
having mandates imposed by them by
 
02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
federal law or other requirements and a
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
business that independently imposes
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates on their employees
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
needs to be aware that they are not
 
02:45:58.150 --> 02:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
shielded from immunity for liability for
 
02:46:00.309 --> 02:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
any harm that happens from those
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines and we know from the viirs
 
02:46:05.269 --> 02:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
reports that hundreds of thousands of
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
people have been injured and
 
02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
hospitalized by these vaccines and over
 
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
22 000 deaths have been reported
 
02:46:14.070 --> 02:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
they are not employers are not protected
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
under the 1986 national childhood
 
02:46:18.790 --> 02:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury act because they are not
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine providers and they are not
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
protected under the prep act because
 
02:46:25.110 --> 02:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
their next vaccine providers so i'm
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
really quite surprised that
 
02:46:27.279 --> 02:46:28.150 align:start position:0%
really quite surprised that
any

02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
um independent
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
any businesses private businesses or
 
02:46:32.950 --> 02:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
schools would
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
independently impose these vaccine
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
mandates so in the end
 
02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
i do support this bill i think it is a
 
02:46:41.269 --> 02:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
tremendous compromise
 
02:46:41.279 --> 02:46:42.070 align:start position:0%
tremendous compromise
for

02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
all of us that will help with staffing
 
02:46:46.630 --> 02:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
problems thank you
 
02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony there any
 
02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:52.479 align:start position:0%

02:47:09.670 --> 02:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
02:47:13.349 --> 02:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
committee my name is sean thomas with
 
02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
the mers and praise hall we represent
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire nurses association
 
02:47:18.389 --> 02:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity and time
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
to testify i did provide written
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
or hard copies of a written statement
 
02:47:25.990 --> 02:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
prepared by the association which was
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
also submitted electronically but didn't
 
02:47:29.830 --> 02:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
want to provide hard copies as well i
 
02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
won't read it
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
but instead try to quickly summarize it
 
02:47:35.830 --> 02:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
i know you're behind schedule
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire nurses association is
 
02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to hb 1210
 
02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of hb1210
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
is to avoid any vaccine mandate
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
including those imposed by a private
 
02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:48.469 align:start position:0%
including those imposed by a private
employer

02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:47:52.309 --> 02:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
hb 1210 itself however seems to
 
02:47:54.630 --> 02:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
seems to look like a mandate a mandate
 
02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
that tells businesses you can't decide
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
what's in your own best interest
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
including the health and safety of
 
02:48:02.070 --> 02:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
employees or in the case of health care
 
02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:03.990 align:start position:0%
employees or in the case of health care
patients

02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:48:06.630 --> 02:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
with a conscientious objector exemption
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
granted with no questions asked
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
even if a business already requires or
 
02:48:13.910 --> 02:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
intends to require a vaccine this would
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
basically render that decision nell and
 
02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:17.750 align:start position:0%
basically render that decision nell and
void

02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
void
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
another thing to point out this bill
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
also isn't limited to copen 19 vaccine
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
but vaccines generally
 
02:48:27.190 --> 02:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
however because the coba 19 vaccine
 
02:48:28.870 --> 02:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
seems to be the immediate intent i
 
02:48:31.269 --> 02:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
didn't want to point out the coping 19
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine is approved it's recommended it
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
has been proven to be safe and effective
 
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
and it is the best tool we have to end
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire nurses association is
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
opposed to hb 1210 because it would
 
02:48:44.710 --> 02:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
interfere with businesses including
 
02:48:47.429 --> 02:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
hospitals long-term care facilities
 
02:48:48.790 --> 02:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
and other health care facilities in
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
terms of choosing how to best protect
 
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of their staff and
 
02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:53.670 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of their staff and
patients

02:48:53.670 --> 02:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
hp 1210 takes away a tool to businesses
 
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
to health healthcare facilities
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
that could be used to keep their
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
workplaces safe and open in healthcare
 
02:49:04.950 --> 02:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
settings it's important that we keep our
 
02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
nurses and healthcare heroes safe and at
 
02:49:09.750 --> 02:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
work and doing what they do best caring
 
02:49:11.590 --> 02:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
for and protecting patients the new
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire nurses association urges you

um
 
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire nurses association
 
02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill
 
02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming you all polled the nurses
 
02:49:35.190 --> 02:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and
 
02:49:37.269 --> 02:49:37.279 align:start position:0%
what was the percentage of nurses who
 
02:49:39.030 --> 02:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
said they did not wish to take the
 
02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:40.790 align:start position:0%
said they did not wish to take the
vaccine

02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:41.910 align:start position:0%
vaccine
the

02:49:41.910 --> 02:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire nurses association
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
represents about 1300 nurses out of
 
02:49:48.230 --> 02:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
about 20 000 in the state
 
02:49:50.389 --> 02:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any poll but i do know
 
02:49:51.990 --> 02:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
there is data
 
02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
that over 90 of nurses in the state have
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated
 
02:49:58.150 --> 02:49:58.160 align:start position:0%

irving mr uh york
 
02:50:16.469 --> 02:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
you requested in the uh in greater than
 
02:50:18.469 --> 02:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
five minutes i'd appreciate it given the
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
time we have left for this hearing if
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
you could be concise
 
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:33.510 --> 02:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
members i'll try to be brief
 
02:50:35.269 --> 02:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
there's a very important legislation
 
02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
especially as it relates to the
 
02:50:40.550 --> 02:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not vaccinated
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
i don't i'm not in the working world so
 
02:50:51.510 --> 02:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have the ability to
 
02:50:54.870 --> 02:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
apply for an exemption
 
02:50:56.469 --> 02:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
i consider myself
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
pretty fit even though i'm an old fiddle
 
02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have any religion
 
02:51:03.590 --> 02:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not eligible for any of those
 
02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:05.510 align:start position:0%
i'm not eligible for any of those
exemptions

02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
02:51:07.269 --> 02:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes that doesn't even matter if
 
02:51:09.990 --> 02:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
you submit a religious or a medical
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
exemption many of these from personal
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
experience of people that i know are
 
02:51:17.110 --> 02:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
not accepted anyway
 
02:51:20.950 --> 02:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
so a conscientious objection allows for
 
02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
someone like myself
 
02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
and especially the younger population
 
02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:28.090 align:start position:0%
and especially the younger population
to

02:51:28.090 --> 02:51:28.100 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:51:28.100 --> 02:51:29.269 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

02:51:29.269 --> 02:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:51:29.279 --> 02:51:30.230 align:start position:0%
[Music]
receive

02:51:30.230 --> 02:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
receive
 
02:51:32.550 --> 02:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
an exemption
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
in this state in this country probably
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
one in four people have no religious
 
02:51:36.479 --> 02:51:38.150 align:start position:0%
one in four people have no religious
affiliation

02:51:38.150 --> 02:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
affiliation
 
02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
for the younger people it's probably a
 
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
third to a half have no religious
 
02:51:45.349 --> 02:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
affiliation this conscientious objection
 
02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
is a very important part of this
 
02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:49.670 align:start position:0%
is a very important part of this
legislation

02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
and i do
 
02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate the wording
 
02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
in the bill that says and it shall be
 
02:51:56.560 --> 02:51:58.389 align:start position:0%
in the bill that says and it shall be
accepted

02:51:58.389 --> 02:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's very important you know you have
 
02:52:04.150 --> 02:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
to accept this as someone's
 
02:52:06.230 --> 02:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
request for an exemption
 
02:52:09.429 --> 02:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
is having employers
 
02:52:15.910 --> 02:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
impose what they consider a reasonable
 
02:52:15.920 --> 02:52:18.469 align:start position:0%
impose what they consider a reasonable
accommodation

02:52:18.469 --> 02:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
from an employer standpoint a reasonable
 
02:52:23.990 --> 02:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
accommodation may be for an employee to
 
02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
wear a face mask
 
02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
maybe wear a
 
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
glass or a shield
 
02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:31.750 align:start position:0%
glass or a shield
uh

02:52:31.750 --> 02:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:32.790 align:start position:0%
uh
maybe

02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:52:36.630 --> 02:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
submit to weekly or bi-weekly testing
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
for the person who stock shelves i'm
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
before the stock boy or stock gal at the
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
market basket we can accommodate you
 
02:52:48.230 --> 02:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
you can't be in front of people which i
 
02:52:50.389 --> 02:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
know you enjoy but we can put you on the
 
02:52:53.429 --> 02:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
11 to 7 midnight or graveyard shift
 
02:52:55.510 --> 02:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's how we'll accommodate you
 
02:52:57.750 --> 02:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable to the employer but
 
02:52:59.830 --> 02:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
imagine how acceptable that is to the
 
02:52:59.840 --> 02:53:01.269 align:start position:0%
imagine how acceptable that is to the
employee

02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
employee
 
02:53:03.429 --> 02:53:03.439 align:start position:0%
that just speaks so loudly of
 
02:53:03.439 --> 02:53:06.870 align:start position:0%
that just speaks so loudly of
discrimination

02:53:06.870 --> 02:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:09.429 --> 02:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
i also think that
 
02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
the bill might be strengthened by
 
02:53:15.110 --> 02:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
some some wording that i will uh give to
 
02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
the committee uh sponsors
 
02:53:20.389 --> 02:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh the whole cons and i'd like to
 
02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
address um
 
02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
the issue of someone made a comment
 
02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
about this person is not unvaccinated
 
02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:36.389 --> 02:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what that even means not
 
02:53:36.399 --> 02:53:38.230 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what that even means not
protected

02:53:38.230 --> 02:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
protected
 
02:53:40.230 --> 02:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte had some good
 
02:53:42.150 --> 02:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
questions how do we
 
02:53:43.750 --> 02:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
distinguish between someone who's not
 
02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated versus a vaccinated person
 
02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:53.590 --> 02:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
an unvaccinated person is going to be
 
02:53:56.150 --> 02:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
symptomatic if they're infected
 
02:54:00.309 --> 02:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:00.319 --> 02:54:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
likely

02:54:01.510 --> 02:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
likely
 
02:54:03.190 --> 02:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
will have reduced symptoms and may be
 
02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:05.830 align:start position:0%
will have reduced symptoms and may be
asymptomatic

02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic
 
02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:07.429 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic
therefore

02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
02:54:11.110 --> 02:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
to think that an unvaccinated person
 
02:54:13.110 --> 02:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
is not suitable to be
 
02:54:14.470 --> 02:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
working in an oncology
 
02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:15.910 align:start position:0%
working in an oncology

situation

02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
because they're not safe that's an
 
02:54:22.469 --> 02:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
outdated concept we know that
 
02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
and most of us probably know people
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
who've had the vaccine and boosted up
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
the wazoo who actually
 
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
have had covet
 
02:54:32.710 --> 02:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
they're not protected they got they got
 
02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:33.429 align:start position:0%
they're not protected they got they got
the

02:54:33.429 --> 02:54:33.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:54:35.590 --> 02:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
disease sure maybe they've had fewer
 
02:54:37.110 --> 02:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
symptoms but
 
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that suggests that
 
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
someone who's vaccinated
 
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
is better
 
02:54:46.309 --> 02:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
at not spreading the disease
 
02:54:48.309 --> 02:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
and believe me i'm an unvaccinated
 
02:54:51.110 --> 02:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
person i have no i'm not endowed with
 
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
any super
 
02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
super powers that would let me infect
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else any more than people who are
 
02:55:00.710 --> 02:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated virus is gonna virus it's
 
02:55:02.630 --> 02:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
gonna spread we don't have any
 
02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
protection from that
 
02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to address comments some of the
 
02:55:08.870 --> 02:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
hospital administration and other
 
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
affiliated healthcare representatives
 
02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:13.030 align:start position:0%
affiliated healthcare representatives
here

02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:55:15.670 --> 02:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
they they say things like a one percent
 
02:55:17.349 --> 02:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
of our
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
health care workers decided
 
02:55:21.349 --> 02:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
we lost them because they didn't want to
 
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
well remember that all these people are
 
02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:25.990 align:start position:0%
well remember that all these people are
being

02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
forced to follow a mandate with coercion
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
you get the vaccine or you lose your job
 
02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
we need this conscientious objector
 
02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:39.269 align:start position:0%
we need this conscientious objector
status

02:55:39.269 --> 02:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:39.279 --> 02:55:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
personally

02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
personally
 
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
and let me let me just address the
 
02:55:45.590 --> 02:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
college situation as well
 
02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned that there was
 
02:55:50.230 --> 02:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
this policy is working well for us that
 
02:55:51.990 --> 02:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
is the exemption policy
 
02:55:53.269 --> 02:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
a medical exemption and a religious
 
02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:56.309 align:start position:0%
a medical exemption and a religious
exemption

02:55:56.309 --> 02:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
okay how many college
 
02:56:00.309 --> 02:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
students would be eligible for a medical
 
02:56:02.469 --> 02:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
exemption these are people in their the
 
02:56:05.030 --> 02:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
healthiest point in their lives how many
 
02:56:07.110 --> 02:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
would have a religious exemption
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
maybe half
 
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
and by the way so a place like cornell
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
university i think it was cornell
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
recently had the closed down because
 
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
they had a huge outbreak sent all their
 
02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
kids home
 
02:56:25.510 --> 02:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
to spread the infection wherever they
 
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
live cross country across state whatever
 
02:56:31.750 --> 02:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:34.630 --> 02:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
and i'll close with just some
 
02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
personal experiences i have a son who
 
02:56:40.630 --> 02:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
worked as a social worker at a state a
 
02:56:44.150 --> 02:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
large state health care provider
 
02:56:46.150 --> 02:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
been there six years
 
02:56:48.070 --> 02:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
a mandate was threatened by the
 
02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:49.110 align:start position:0%
a mandate was threatened by the
government

02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:56:51.510 --> 02:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
the company decided to
 
02:56:56.309 --> 02:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
he did not have the ability to give
 
02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
a medical
 
02:57:03.349 --> 02:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
or religious exemption
 
02:57:03.359 --> 02:57:04.230 align:start position:0%
or religious exemption
he

02:57:04.230 --> 02:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
he
 
02:57:07.110 --> 02:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
even if he able to give it
 
02:57:09.750 --> 02:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
he needed he needed uh an ability to
 
02:57:12.870 --> 02:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
give a conscientious objector
 
02:57:15.910 --> 02:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
exemption but that was not present he
 
02:57:17.910 --> 02:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
lost his job he was forced out of his
 
02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:19.349 align:start position:0%
lost his job he was forced out of his
job

02:57:19.349 --> 02:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
job
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
my niece worked at uh
 
02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:24.309 align:start position:0%
my niece worked at uh
massachusetts

02:57:24.309 --> 02:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:57:26.469 --> 02:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
large hospital association as an
 
02:57:26.479 --> 02:57:28.150 align:start position:0%
large hospital association as an

submitted a religious exemption
 
02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
was denied
 
02:57:35.349 --> 02:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
she was forced out and now she and her
 
02:57:38.469 --> 02:57:38.479 align:start position:0%

good afternoon and thank you for the
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
on this bill i am in support of the bill
 
02:58:16.309 --> 02:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
i'd like to start by saying opponents of
 
02:58:18.070 --> 02:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
this bill based their objections on the
 
02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
false premise that covid is more deadly
 
02:58:22.469 --> 02:58:22.479 align:start position:0%
than it is we can barely hear you could
 
02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
you speak just i know you there are
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
clean wipes if you don't want to get too
 
02:58:28.309 --> 02:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
close to the microphone
 
02:58:30.469 --> 02:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you opponents of this bill
 
02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
based their objections on the false
 
02:58:34.230 --> 02:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
premise that covid is more deadly than
 
02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
it is

the covet vaccines do not work that was
 
02:58:46.389 --> 02:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
admitted by the ceo of pfizer a few
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
02:58:50.150 --> 02:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
two dozen this is a quote two doses of
 
02:58:51.990 --> 02:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
the vaccine offers very limited
 
02:58:53.590 --> 02:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
protection if any
 
02:58:55.750 --> 02:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
the three doses with the booster offer
 
02:58:57.269 --> 02:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable protection against
 
02:58:59.190 --> 02:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
hospitalization and deaths
 
02:59:01.670 --> 02:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
and that isn't very good and
 
02:59:04.389 --> 02:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
less protection against infection
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
the covet vaccines don't prevent
 
02:59:07.750 --> 02:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
infection they don't prevent
 
02:59:09.269 --> 02:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
transmission and there are many
 
02:59:12.150 --> 02:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
potential adverse side effects
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
therefore there must be exemptions
 
02:59:16.870 --> 02:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
regarding covet vaccine mandates
 
02:59:18.870 --> 02:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
there are many experts and real world
 
02:59:20.790 --> 02:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
examples that provide proof that there
 
02:59:22.950 --> 02:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
is no justification that the vaccine
 
02:59:24.790 --> 02:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
should be mandated due to potential
 
02:59:26.630 --> 02:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous side effects
 
02:59:29.670 --> 02:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
including critical organ damage and
 
02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:30.790 align:start position:0%
including critical organ damage and
death

death
 
02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:33.439 align:start position:0%

use of the modern vaccination on those
 
02:59:37.510 --> 02:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
30 and under due to potential side
 
02:59:40.150 --> 02:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
effects a few days after that iceland
 
02:59:43.750 --> 02:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
banned the modern vaccine for everyone
 
02:59:45.910 --> 02:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
the american heart association concluded
 
02:59:48.389 --> 02:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
the experimental gene vaccines increase

this novel technology has not been

adequately tested we need at least five
 
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
years of testing and research before we
 
03:00:29.429 --> 03:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
can really understand the risks

harms and risks from the new medicines
 
03:00:33.670 --> 03:00:33.680 align:start position:0%

nurses have been vaccinated
 
03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
what you didn't hear is how many of
 
03:03:20.710 --> 03:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
those nurses were forced to take that
 
03:03:23.429 --> 03:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
vaccination against their will in order
 
03:03:26.389 --> 03:03:26.399 align:start position:0%

in our calling to serve and raise these

and the ability to financially care for

our families
 
03:05:43.590 --> 03:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
the liberty of conscience is fundamental
 
03:05:45.990 --> 03:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
in today's current climate we have a
 
03:05:48.389 --> 03:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
false dilemma between faith personal
 
03:05:50.469 --> 03:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
choice and one's autonomy and medical
 
03:05:53.190 --> 03:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
care an individual's interpretation of
 
03:05:55.830 --> 03:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
personal beliefs or religion and medical
 
03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
data should not shape one's decision on
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not to receive an inoculation
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
of any kind
 
03:06:04.710 --> 03:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
but the decision must still be made in
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
light of one's conscience this bill
 
03:06:09.429 --> 03:06:09.439 align:start position:0%
would ease the pressure from employers
 
03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
and institutions from being the arbiters
 
03:06:14.710 --> 03:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
of their employees or students religious
 
03:06:14.720 --> 03:06:15.750 align:start position:0%
of their employees or students religious
beliefs

03:06:15.750 --> 03:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
03:06:18.150 --> 03:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
personal beliefs or one's medical
 
03:06:20.230 --> 03:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
conditions that may be a barrier from
 
03:06:23.269 --> 03:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
receiving any particular immunizations i
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
think relief relief is something so
 
03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
needed and so necessary right now by
 
03:06:30.230 --> 03:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
removing the obstacle from employers and
 
03:06:32.070 --> 03:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
institutions to have
 
03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
to make these hard calls on individual
 
03:06:37.750 --> 03:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
employees and students medical religious
 
03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
or personal beliefs you in turn relieve
 
03:06:44.309 --> 03:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
the stress on all sides of the equations
 
03:06:46.389 --> 03:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
and regain the clarity to focus on the
 
03:06:48.630 --> 03:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
priorities of not only the employer
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
employees successes but the educational
 
03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:53.520 align:start position:0%

03:06:53.520 --> 03:06:55.110 align:start position:0%

thank you are there any questions
 
03:07:00.070 --> 03:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you roson chester
 
03:07:07.110 --> 03:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:08.469 --> 03:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
03:07:11.349 --> 03:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
committee members um i wanted to start
 
03:07:11.359 --> 03:07:13.269 align:start position:0%
committee members um i wanted to start
by

03:07:13.269 --> 03:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
just saying that i googled is our
 
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines approved by the fda
 
03:07:22.870 --> 03:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
according to the fda as of january 7
 
03:07:26.150 --> 03:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
2022 the covenant back the copic 19
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine continues to be
 
03:07:30.469 --> 03:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
issued for you
 
03:07:30.479 --> 03:07:32.070 align:start position:0%
issued for you
eua

03:07:32.070 --> 03:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
eua
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
so this copin 19 vaccine that we keep
 
03:07:39.670 --> 03:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
talking about is not currently approved
 
03:07:40.950 --> 03:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
by the
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
food and drug administration of the
 
03:07:44.950 --> 03:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
united states what i love about this
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
bill is it's not specific to cobit 19.
 
03:07:51.750 --> 03:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
what cobit 19 has done for us is it's
 
03:07:56.150 --> 03:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
forced us to understand how absolutely
 
03:07:58.630 --> 03:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
critical it is that the state of new
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire and its residents and its
 
03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
small businesses are protected by an
 
03:08:03.600 --> 03:08:05.110 align:start position:0%
small businesses are protected by an
overhanded

03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
overhanded
 
03:08:05.120 --> 03:08:06.870 align:start position:0%
overhanded
potentially

03:08:06.870 --> 03:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
not in our best interest federal
 
03:08:09.520 --> 03:08:11.349 align:start position:0%
not in our best interest federal
government

03:08:11.349 --> 03:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:08:13.030 --> 03:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill does it
 
03:08:13.040 --> 03:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill does it
provides

03:08:14.230 --> 03:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
provides
 
03:08:16.870 --> 03:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
our citizens and our small businesses
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:26.150 --> 03:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
it does it does a good job with
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
businesses providing with the
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be least restrictive
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
environment without losing workforce and
 
03:08:33.750 --> 03:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
further protects new hampshire's
 
03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:36.230 align:start position:0%
further protects new hampshire's
advantage

03:08:36.230 --> 03:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
03:08:38.870 --> 03:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
because we're getting a lot of folks now
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
because of what's going on in
 
03:08:42.790 --> 03:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and they're finding out
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
that they can work at parkland and not
 
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated we've we've increased our
 
03:08:48.240 --> 03:08:50.070 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated we've we've increased our
our

03:08:50.070 --> 03:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:08:52.389 --> 03:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
folks there by i think they said they
 
03:08:54.550 --> 03:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
they hired 15 new staff out of state
 
03:08:56.790 --> 03:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
staff in parkland medical in less than a
 
03:08:56.800 --> 03:08:58.630 align:start position:0%
staff in parkland medical in less than a
month

03:08:58.630 --> 03:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
month
 
03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's phenomenal um
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
it also puts equal responsibility on
 
03:09:06.870 --> 03:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
both the the individual employee as well
 
03:09:08.389 --> 03:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
as the small business
 
03:09:10.230 --> 03:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
the individual employee has a
 
03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility to file for an exemption
 
03:09:13.439 --> 03:09:14.309 align:start position:0%
responsibility to file for an exemption
the

03:09:14.309 --> 03:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
business has the capability
 
03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
of saying i'm going to do what our state
 
03:09:22.469 --> 03:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
constitution and our state legislature
 
03:09:25.590 --> 03:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
has made appropriate and
 
03:09:27.429 --> 03:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
be able to have a little teeth behind
 
03:09:29.830 --> 03:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
them when and if they have to go up to
 
03:09:31.750 --> 03:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
against the federal government
 
03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:32.630 align:start position:0%
against the federal government
um

03:09:32.630 --> 03:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
i heard people talk today about it would
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
it would um feels as though it would re
 
03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
reverse process
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
reverse the progress we've made
 
03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:09:45.030 --> 03:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
exemptions would increase people willing
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
to take the vaccine
 
03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's basically saying
 
03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to coerce and control you
 
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
until you do what we tell you
 
03:09:56.309 --> 03:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
we and the people of new hampshire are
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
not children to be punished when we
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
don't do
 
03:10:02.309 --> 03:10:02.319 align:start position:0%
what the federal government tells us to
 
03:10:02.319 --> 03:10:03.030 align:start position:0%
what the federal government tells us to
do

03:10:03.030 --> 03:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:08.479 --> 03:10:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
lastly

03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i like like i said
 
03:10:15.990 --> 03:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't pertain to the coven 19
 
03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:17.670 align:start position:0%
it doesn't pertain to the coven 19
um

03:10:17.670 --> 03:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:17.680 --> 03:10:19.349 align:start position:0%
um
covid19

03:10:19.349 --> 03:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
covid19
 
03:10:19.359 --> 03:10:20.469 align:start position:0%
covid19
specific

03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:10:23.110 --> 03:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine it pertains to any medical
 
03:10:25.670 --> 03:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
experimental or non-approved medical
 
03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:27.190 align:start position:0%
experimental or non-approved medical
procedure

03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
and that's important to understand
 
03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
this is not about covert 19 this is
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
about the next pandemic and the next
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the next oversight of the
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:41.349 --> 03:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
and that being said
 
03:10:43.110 --> 03:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
with regards to
 
03:10:45.750 --> 03:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
um including beyond religious and
 
03:10:47.110 --> 03:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
medical beliefs
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
religious religious and medical
 
03:10:48.960 --> 03:10:50.630 align:start position:0%
religious religious and medical
exemptions

03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
there have been a number of people that
 
03:10:55.670 --> 03:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
have been denied medical exemptions
 
03:10:58.469 --> 03:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions because their
 
03:11:03.429 --> 03:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
employer or their hr feels that they are
 
03:11:05.910 --> 03:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
judge and jury on what is an appropriate
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
religious exemption and what is not
 
03:11:10.950 --> 03:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
and that ends up going to the
 
03:11:13.030 --> 03:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the discrimination board
 
03:11:15.750 --> 03:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
this putting this in there would allow
 
03:11:15.760 --> 03:11:16.790 align:start position:0%
this putting this in there would allow
people

03:11:16.790 --> 03:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:11:19.590 --> 03:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
i truly believe that we would see
 
03:11:22.790 --> 03:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
we would see a decrease in litigation
 
03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
if something like this was passed
 
03:11:28.870 --> 03:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
finally with regards to any type of
 
03:11:31.030 --> 03:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination we already have a process
 
03:11:32.309 --> 03:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
let's not let's not try and create
 
03:11:36.070 --> 03:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
something that's not let's not try to
 
03:11:38.309 --> 03:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
fix something that's not broke
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
if reasonable accommodations cannot be
 
03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
if reasonable accommodations cannot be
met

03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
met
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
the employee has the ability to file a
 
03:11:44.479 --> 03:11:45.750 align:start position:0%
the employee has the ability to file a
complaint

03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
03:11:47.670 --> 03:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's already in effect
 
03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change that at all
 
03:11:53.429 --> 03:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it allows
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
employees to get back to work to doing
 
03:11:58.469 --> 03:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
the careers they love and it allows
 
03:12:00.790 --> 03:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
employers to providing the goods and
 
03:12:03.269 --> 03:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
services to the people of new hampshire
 
03:12:03.279 --> 03:12:04.950 align:start position:0%
services to the people of new hampshire
without

03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:12:07.429 --> 03:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
far overreach restrictions
 
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
just want to end on a supple
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
little end note
 
03:12:14.550 --> 03:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
i like many people have heard about all
 
03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
the terrible things of
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
the consequences of the this uh
 
03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
covert 19 vaccine
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
up until this past weekend
 
03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:30.790 --> 03:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
i got a call from my girlfriend who
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
lives in florida i've known her son
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
since he was 10 years old he's an ems
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
person in
 
03:12:37.439 --> 03:12:39.110 align:start position:0%
person in
boston

03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
boston
 
03:12:41.030 --> 03:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
he was required to continue his
 
03:12:43.670 --> 03:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
employment which he loves
 
03:12:45.269 --> 03:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
to take the vaccines and the booster
 
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
shots he took the booster shot on
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
thursday i don't know which one i didn't
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
ask i thought it was inappropriate
 
03:12:54.150 --> 03:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
but he took the booster shot on thursday
 
03:12:56.469 --> 03:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
because he posted it to
 
03:12:57.590 --> 03:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
one of his
 
03:12:59.429 --> 03:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
instagrams or something
 
03:13:01.990 --> 03:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
friday he flew to florida to spend a
 
03:13:03.429 --> 03:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
week with his mother
 
03:13:07.429 --> 03:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:10.229 --> 03:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
does anybody any employer any
 
03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
03:13:15.510 --> 03:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
any special interest group
 
03:13:18.870 --> 03:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
that is opposing this bill do you want
 
03:13:22.469 --> 03:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
even one life on your conscience
 
03:13:24.309 --> 03:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
i know i don't
 
03:13:26.550 --> 03:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:27.830 --> 03:13:27.840 align:start position:0%

thank you for your testimony any
questions

03:13:30.710 --> 03:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:32.950 --> 03:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
cena thank you very much kendra goodwin
 
03:13:35.590 --> 03:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
followed by julie sims if you could be
 
03:13:37.670 --> 03:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
brief i would appreciate it
 
03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
hi again
 
03:13:40.790 --> 03:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to say that i think
 
03:13:43.510 --> 03:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
this is about individual liberty and not
 
03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:44.870 align:start position:0%
this is about individual liberty and not
corporate

03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
corporate
 
03:13:46.950 --> 03:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
freedom i mean
 
03:13:50.070 --> 03:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's all corporations now any business
 
03:13:52.550 --> 03:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
and um people say
 
03:13:52.560 --> 03:13:53.510 align:start position:0%
and um people say
that

03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
they're accepting exemptions and stuff i
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
work in a hospital system my mother
 
03:13:59.110 --> 03:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
works in a hospital system my cousin in
 
03:14:01.110 --> 03:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
florida works in a hospital system they
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
are denying
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
exemptions they are denying religious
 
03:14:06.309 --> 03:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
exemptions they deny medical exemptions
 
03:14:07.830 --> 03:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
and it's almost impossible to get a
 
03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
medical exemption because doctors won't
 
03:14:10.950 --> 03:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
write them in fear of losing their
 
03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:13.429 align:start position:0%
write them in fear of losing their
license

03:14:13.429 --> 03:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:14.870 --> 03:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
and people who say oh they're safe and
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
effective safe and effective my
 
03:14:19.110 --> 03:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
boyfriend his best friend's girlfriend
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
was 32 years old eight months pregnant
 
03:14:24.150 --> 03:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
she got her vaccine she died a week
 
03:14:26.070 --> 03:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
later in her sleep and she had a brain
 
03:14:27.910 --> 03:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
full of blood clots
 
03:14:30.550 --> 03:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not a coincidence to
 
03:14:32.469 --> 03:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
me i mean that's
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's pretty uh i mean what 32 year old
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
just gets brain full of blood clots for
 
03:14:39.429 --> 03:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
no reason and there's actually doctors
 
03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
out there that are doing these studies
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
and they're actually testing people say
 
03:14:45.750 --> 03:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
oh i feel fine after my vaccine how do
 
03:14:47.429 --> 03:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
you know did you have your blood work
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
done did you have your t cells checked
 
03:14:51.830 --> 03:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
did you have your d dimers checked no
 
03:14:54.150 --> 03:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
they're not and they're finding that
 
03:14:55.910 --> 03:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of these people are decimating
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
their t-cell production
 
03:14:59.910 --> 03:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
which you need to fight
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
disease and if you i pay attention close
 
03:15:05.030 --> 03:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
attention to israel and uk numbers and i
 
03:15:06.229 --> 03:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
actually have it right from their
 
03:15:08.229 --> 03:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
government website vaccinated
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
individuals are now getting coveted are
 
03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
hospitalized from covenant dying from
 
03:15:14.389 --> 03:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
clovid at much higher rates than the
 
03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated and that's rates not
 
03:15:19.670 --> 03:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
raw numbers
 
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it i believe is from
 
03:15:23.349 --> 03:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
your t-cells because you're training
 
03:15:25.349 --> 03:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
your body to only make antibodies and
 
03:15:27.510 --> 03:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
you're not making your t cells anymore
 
03:15:29.110 --> 03:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
which you need to fight respiratory
 
03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:32.870 align:start position:0%
which you need to fight respiratory
viruses

03:15:32.870 --> 03:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
and and we also working at the hospital
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that every hospital
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
right now is having huge outbreaks of
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
covet among their employees
 
03:15:45.830 --> 03:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
and they're all vaccinated
 
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
and you know they'll say oh well you
 
03:15:49.030 --> 03:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
have it more mild if you're vaccinated
 
03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's not true i had covered three
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
weeks ago i had it mild i was over it in
 
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
two days
 
03:15:56.550 --> 03:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i mean this whole notion that oh it's
 
03:15:58.150 --> 03:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
mild if you're vaccinated i mean that
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
they don't you can't possibly know that
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's an assumption
 
03:16:03.830 --> 03:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
i'm unvaccinated and i had it mild i
 
03:16:06.150 --> 03:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
could i have vaccinated family that got
 
03:16:07.750 --> 03:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
covered and had it worse than i did that
 
03:16:09.269 --> 03:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
would be like me saying oh thank god i'm
 
03:16:10.710 --> 03:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
not vaccinated i would have had it so
 
03:16:12.469 --> 03:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
much worse
 
03:16:15.429 --> 03:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
it's just it's crazy even if if the
 
03:16:17.190 --> 03:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
shots worked there's no reason to
 
03:16:19.429 --> 03:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
mandate them because you're protected it
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't matter whether i have or not if
 
03:16:23.349 --> 03:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
they don't work it makes no sense either
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
i mean it just doesn't make any sense
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
and in fact i think the hospitals are
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
putting more people in danger by
 
03:16:31.269 --> 03:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
allowing if you're vaccinated you can
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
come back after five days and expose all
 
03:16:37.190 --> 03:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:37.200 --> 03:16:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:16:38.150 --> 03:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:39.670 --> 03:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
see if there's anything else i wanted to
 
03:16:39.680 --> 03:16:43.269 align:start position:0%
see if there's anything else i wanted to
say

03:16:43.269 --> 03:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:45.990 --> 03:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it at that for now okay
 
03:16:49.110 --> 03:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you with any questions
 
03:16:51.429 --> 03:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
sing none i hold the last pink card in
 
03:16:53.190 --> 03:16:53.200 align:start position:0%

the committee again for the record my
 
03:20:49.830 --> 03:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
name is stephen i'm the president of
 
03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association i
 
03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
provided a testimony i'm here
 
03:20:55.190 --> 03:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
representing all of our hospitals
 
03:20:57.429 --> 03:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
as you can probably well imagine i
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to house bill 1351 for many of
 
03:21:02.469 --> 03:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
the same reasons we were opposed to the
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
last bill
 
03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
i guess i just want to take the
 
03:21:07.349 --> 03:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
03:21:07.359 --> 03:21:09.030 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
say

03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:21:11.030 --> 03:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
what hospitals are doing is attempting
 
03:21:13.750 --> 03:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
to try to protect the health and safety
 
03:21:15.750 --> 03:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
of their patients and to protect their
 
03:21:16.950 --> 03:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
ability to care for all of their
 
03:21:19.510 --> 03:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
patients you know the omicron surge has
 
03:21:21.670 --> 03:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
certainly seen a huge increase in the
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
number of patients that we're seeing
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
truly being overwhelmed you know the
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
hospital association conducts daily
 
03:21:30.309 --> 03:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
huddles every day with our hospitals to
 
03:21:32.950 --> 03:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
help them manage the capacity
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's not just covet patients that
 
03:21:36.630 --> 03:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
they're caring for it's non-covered
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
patients our hospitals are incredibly
 
03:21:41.670 --> 03:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
full finding a bed a med surg bed a
 
03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
traditional hospital bed finding an icu
 
03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
bed can be incredibly challenging our
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals have worked valiantly over
 
03:21:50.790 --> 03:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
these past years to make sure that every
 
03:21:52.950 --> 03:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
patient can get the care they need when
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
and where they need it that's becoming
 
03:21:57.990 --> 03:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
more and more difficult as we see an
 
03:21:59.670 --> 03:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
overwhelming number of people who are
 
03:22:02.710 --> 03:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
becoming infected with covet 19 they're
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
they're ending up in the hospital and
 
03:22:07.110 --> 03:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
that is the burden that we're trying to
 
03:22:09.510 --> 03:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
address and to to reduce that burden so
 
03:22:11.110 --> 03:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
that every patient can get the care they
 
03:22:12.550 --> 03:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
need when and where they need it whether
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're vaccinated unvaccinated whether
 
03:22:16.070 --> 03:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
they have covet or whether they're the
 
03:22:18.229 --> 03:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
victim of an automobile accident a heart
 
03:22:20.550 --> 03:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
attack or something else we need to do
 
03:22:23.429 --> 03:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
everything we can to reduce the burden
 
03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
to ensure the health and safety of our
 
03:22:26.790 --> 03:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
workforce our patients and our
 
03:22:26.800 --> 03:22:28.229 align:start position:0%

i would like to give some more personal
 
03:23:39.510 --> 03:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
context without violating hipaa to the
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
bills proposed today
 
03:23:44.309 --> 03:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
and i am in support of all in the fall
 
03:23:46.630 --> 03:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
of 2019 i took a job as a travel nurse
 
03:23:49.110 --> 03:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
and worked in the boston area
 
03:23:51.269 --> 03:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
when kovit hit the boston area in the
 
03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
spring of 2020 my love and i got sick
 
03:23:55.830 --> 03:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
for me it was mild
 
03:23:58.150 --> 03:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
have had worse clues for tony it was a
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
bit worse his doctor threw a telemedical
 
03:24:02.710 --> 03:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
said yes it sounds like you have the
 
03:24:02.720 --> 03:24:03.750 align:start position:0%
said yes it sounds like you have the
virus

03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
virus
 
03:24:05.990 --> 03:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
and prescribed an inhaler
 
03:24:07.590 --> 03:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
instead of symptoms get worse go to the
 
03:24:07.600 --> 03:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
instead of symptoms get worse go to the
hospital

03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
when picking up his script i also bought
 
03:24:13.590 --> 03:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
vitamin c
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
he had one rough night but got through
 
03:24:17.830 --> 03:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
it without going to the hospital
 
03:24:20.550 --> 03:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
good food supplements fresh air and
 
03:24:23.590 --> 03:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
sunshine all helped his recovery
 
03:24:25.830 --> 03:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
when i returned to work i worked all the
 
03:24:28.469 --> 03:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
coveted units all the med surg
 
03:24:31.349 --> 03:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
i was a helper in the icus
 
03:24:35.910 --> 03:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:37.349 --> 03:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
after a short period of time i
 
03:24:38.950 --> 03:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
recognized a pattern of who was getting
 
03:24:41.030 --> 03:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
sick enough to be hospitalized
 
03:24:43.030 --> 03:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
and shared with the docs our experience
 
03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
and asked if they had looked into at
 
03:24:47.110 --> 03:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
other drugs over the counter
 
03:24:49.269 --> 03:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
anything that people can take at the
 
03:24:51.429 --> 03:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
first sign of symptoms
 
03:24:54.070 --> 03:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
to my surprise their reactions were of
 
03:24:57.429 --> 03:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
fear they had fear over their faces
 
03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
one doc said it's all dependent on viral
 
03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
one doc said it's all dependent on viral
load

03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
load
 
03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
my response was of course
 
03:25:04.469 --> 03:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean you can't try to
 
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
prevent hospitalization and death
 
03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
his response we don't have time
 
03:25:10.950 --> 03:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're too busy treating those in the
 
03:25:10.960 --> 03:25:12.630 align:start position:0%
we're too busy treating those in the
hospital

03:25:12.630 --> 03:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:25:15.190 --> 03:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
with just one protocol
 
03:25:18.389 --> 03:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:21.030 --> 03:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
i did see a few patients getting iv high
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
dose vitamin c and iv multivitamins
 
03:25:27.190 --> 03:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
in may of 2020 i had a patient with
 
03:25:29.349 --> 03:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
rheumatoid arthritis
 
03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
on hydroxychloroquine
 
03:25:34.309 --> 03:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
came in for severe covet
 
03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
oxygen saturation of 86
 
03:25:38.630 --> 03:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
and a fever
 
03:25:40.389 --> 03:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
now before you start pointing fingers
 
03:25:43.510 --> 03:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
and say see hcq doesn't work i argue it
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
kept this patient out of the icu
 
03:25:47.830 --> 03:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
they were given the room to severe and
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
low dose steroids by day five the
 
03:25:52.150 --> 03:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
patient only required one liter of
 
03:25:54.070 --> 03:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
oxygen at night
 
03:25:55.590 --> 03:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
the patient was discharged home with
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
supplemental oxygen in total they just
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
needed a little more time to recover and
 
03:26:01.830 --> 03:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
could do that at home
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
three days later the patient returned
 
03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
all symptoms had returned and required
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
three liters of oxygen
 
03:26:07.920 --> 03:26:10.790 align:start position:0%
three liters of oxygen
again

03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:12.550 --> 03:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
on the second day of this patient's
 
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
readmission i got a report that the docs
 
03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
were probably going to discharge this
 
03:26:18.790 --> 03:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
patient after not doing anything just
 
03:26:20.710 --> 03:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
had been monitoring
 
03:26:23.030 --> 03:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
i reviewed all the labs notes
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
assessed the patient and asked more
 
03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:26.309 align:start position:0%
assessed the patient and asked more
questions

03:26:26.309 --> 03:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
my conclusion was they are not looking
 
03:26:30.950 --> 03:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
at this patient's immune system or
 
03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
rather the lack thereof
 
03:26:36.389 --> 03:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
i contacted the doc and said just that
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
ask them to at least try iv vitamin c
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
the doc said i like where you're going
 
03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
with this and they tested the patient
 
03:26:44.630 --> 03:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
for antibodies
 
03:26:47.830 --> 03:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
and they had none
 
03:26:50.309 --> 03:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
the patient was given donor antibodies
 
03:26:52.710 --> 03:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
from recovered cova patients
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
discharged the next day not needing
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
supplemental oxygen
 
03:27:01.590 --> 03:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
one size does not fit all
 
03:27:03.910 --> 03:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
03:27:06.550 --> 03:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
two patients with the same diagnosis
 
03:27:10.389 --> 03:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
with some of the same things but
 
03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
tailored to their needs
 
03:27:15.910 --> 03:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
in that same month the covet recovering
 
03:27:18.469 --> 03:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
patient had developed c diff this is an
 
03:27:20.950 --> 03:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
intestinal infection
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
and going septic
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
the doc said very flippantly
 
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
the protocol states after one round of
 
03:27:29.590 --> 03:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
antibiotics there's no need to treat
 
03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:30.870 align:start position:0%
antibiotics there's no need to treat
again

03:27:30.870 --> 03:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:27:33.510 --> 03:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
i i reiterated the clinical status of
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
the patient that c diff was a cyclical
 
03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
infection and quite frankly your
 
03:27:39.990 --> 03:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
protocol is inaccurate
 
03:27:41.510 --> 03:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
now that this patient has been in the
 
03:27:43.510 --> 03:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
hospital for nearly eight weeks
 
03:27:45.830 --> 03:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
recovering slowly you're going to let
 
03:27:48.070 --> 03:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
them die from a treatable intestinal
 
03:27:48.080 --> 03:27:49.910 align:start position:0%
them die from a treatable intestinal
infection

03:27:49.910 --> 03:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
infection
 
03:27:51.349 --> 03:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
the doc put the order in to have the
 
03:27:53.670 --> 03:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
stool sample evaluated for c diff the
 
03:27:55.830 --> 03:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
sample was positive and the patient was
 
03:27:59.830 --> 03:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
treated with a new drug and stabilized
 
03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
also in that month
 
03:28:03.750 --> 03:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
the negative pressure system on one unit
 
03:28:03.760 --> 03:28:06.070 align:start position:0%
the negative pressure system on one unit
failed

03:28:06.070 --> 03:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
failed
 
03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
what that does is filter the air
 
03:28:09.750 --> 03:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
multiple times from the patient's rooms
 
03:28:12.389 --> 03:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
before circulating elsewhere
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
that system failure
 
03:28:16.630 --> 03:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
was corrected approximately 25 minutes
 
03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:18.550 align:start position:0%
was corrected approximately 25 minutes
later

03:28:18.550 --> 03:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
later
 
03:28:19.990 --> 03:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
during that time the air from the
 
03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
patient's rooms who were all covered
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
circulated on that unit and possibly to
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
other units
 
03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
hepa filter fans were placed on all
 
03:28:31.349 --> 03:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
units we were all told to put on our
 
03:28:34.389 --> 03:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
n95s and eye shields and report to them
 
03:28:36.790 --> 03:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
if we got sick
 
03:28:38.710 --> 03:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
eight staff on that unit where the leak
 
03:28:41.429 --> 03:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
occurred got sick
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:48.469 --> 03:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
fast forward to the spring of 2021
 
03:28:50.950 --> 03:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
with the roll out of the vaccines
 
03:28:53.429 --> 03:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
i had many questions which which i could
 
03:28:55.750 --> 03:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
not find the answers
 
03:28:57.349 --> 03:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
and was not willing to play russian
 
03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
roulette with experimental gene therapy
 
03:29:03.030 --> 03:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
i had finally found dr peter mccullough
 
03:29:05.670 --> 03:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
and his early treatment protocol finally
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
reports were coming out from around the
 
03:29:09.030 --> 03:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
world on effective
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
treatments all could be modified for the
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
patient's needs
 
03:29:15.190 --> 03:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
in late april i started seeing vaccine
 
03:29:15.200 --> 03:29:16.469 align:start position:0%

03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
no known cause
 
03:29:48.790 --> 03:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
again i tried challenging the docs in
 
03:29:50.469 --> 03:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
many instances
 
03:29:52.229 --> 03:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
i could see the attempted cover up with
 
03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
inappropriate diagnosis and unwilling to
 
03:29:57.190 --> 03:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
scan with an mri which is a higher
 
03:30:00.710 --> 03:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
resolution than ct scan
 
03:30:02.229 --> 03:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
i witnessed people's lives being
 
03:30:02.239 --> 03:30:03.990 align:start position:0%
i witnessed people's lives being
destroyed

03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
destroyed
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
what a reasonable person
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
after having coveted at home
 
03:30:10.309 --> 03:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
working a solid to eight weeks of covet
 
03:30:10.319 --> 03:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
working a solid to eight weeks of covet
only

03:30:11.750 --> 03:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:30:13.750 --> 03:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
getting mildly ill
 
03:30:15.429 --> 03:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
what a reasonable person with critical
 
03:30:16.870 --> 03:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
thinking skills
 
03:30:19.349 --> 03:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
take this risk with an experimental gene
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
therapy vaccine
 
03:30:23.830 --> 03:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
let alone a person like me that
 
03:30:26.950 --> 03:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
traditional vaccines don't work for
 
03:30:30.070 --> 03:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
one size does not fit all
 
03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
now we see this gene therapy is failing
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
not working
 
03:30:36.070 --> 03:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
yet employers in hospitals are requiring
 
03:30:36.080 --> 03:30:38.150 align:start position:0%
yet employers in hospitals are requiring
boosters

03:30:38.150 --> 03:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
boosters
 
03:30:39.429 --> 03:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
you might get an exemption if you're
 
03:30:39.439 --> 03:30:41.110 align:start position:0%
you might get an exemption if you're
lucky

03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
lucky
 
03:30:43.429 --> 03:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
i chose to walk away
 
03:30:45.830 --> 03:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
from my travel position
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to jump through hoops
 
03:30:50.710 --> 03:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
have to prove i was not sick
 
03:30:52.389 --> 03:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
i sold my place in connecticut and
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
purchased a clnc educational program
 
03:30:57.429 --> 03:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
this is a certification program to
 
03:30:59.830 --> 03:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
become a legal nurse consultant to
 
03:30:59.840 --> 03:31:02.389 align:start position:0%
become a legal nurse consultant to
attorneys

03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
03:31:04.469 --> 03:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
for or against personal injury medical
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
malpractice workman's comp just to name
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:13.269 --> 03:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
bedside nursing has been my passion
 
03:31:15.269 --> 03:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
and because of these mandates i had to
 
03:31:18.309 --> 03:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.150 --> 03:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
it was like a scene out of the twilight
 
03:31:20.160 --> 03:31:21.349 align:start position:0%
it was like a scene out of the twilight
zone

03:31:21.349 --> 03:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
zone
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
most of those i worked with
 
03:31:25.110 --> 03:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
just rolled over
 
03:31:27.110 --> 03:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
threw away critical thinking
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
and marched to the beat of a new drum
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
now i'm labeled a conspiracy theorist an
 
03:31:35.429 --> 03:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
anti-vaxx an unclean person
 
03:31:37.830 --> 03:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
sound familiar
 
03:31:40.389 --> 03:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
this is similar to the propaganda
 
03:31:42.070 --> 03:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
perpetrated on the german people in the
 
03:31:42.080 --> 03:31:44.630 align:start position:0%
perpetrated on the german people in the
1930s

03:31:44.630 --> 03:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
1930s
 
03:31:47.830 --> 03:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
this date gives me a little bit of hope
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
you the lawmakers you uphold the
 
03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
constitution and our rights
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
to our bodies
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
that just maybe this little mighty
 
03:31:58.070 --> 03:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
freedom state
 
03:32:03.990 --> 03:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:06.790 --> 03:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
from madness and tyranny
 
03:32:08.469 --> 03:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
in regards to this bill this should
 
03:32:12.870 --> 03:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
include all employers and hospitals
 
03:32:15.670 --> 03:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
and at the end i just would like to add
 
03:32:17.910 --> 03:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
that all through the summer tony and i
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
went all around
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts new hampshire connecticut
 
03:32:25.110 --> 03:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
didn't get sick delta delta plus delta
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it was going
 
03:32:26.399 --> 03:32:30.070 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it was going
around

03:32:30.070 --> 03:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:32.550 --> 03:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
then omicron came along
 
03:32:35.429 --> 03:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
we went and visited family and my family
 
03:32:37.830 --> 03:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
in connecticut
 
03:32:39.910 --> 03:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
and stopped at one place where the
 
03:32:39.920 --> 03:32:42.070 align:start position:0%
and stopped at one place where the
cashier

03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
cashier
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
wearing a mess and pulling it down
 
03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
coughing hacking sneezing watering eyes
 
03:32:50.070 --> 03:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
there was you know plastic and i was
 
03:32:51.269 --> 03:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
like oh boy
 
03:32:52.870 --> 03:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
well i had taken my prophylactic guy
 
03:32:52.880 --> 03:32:56.309 align:start position:0%
well i had taken my prophylactic guy
vermectin

03:32:56.309 --> 03:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:59.030 --> 03:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
that evening when we were driving home
 
03:33:03.190 --> 03:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
then the next morning i had a sore
 
03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
throat a headache body aches
 
03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
so i called my mom
 
03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
i said hey just let you know on the way
 
03:33:12.870 --> 03:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
home i didn't feel well
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm having this morning
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:33:18.070 --> 03:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
make sure you're taking everything that
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
you need to be taking
 
03:33:23.910 --> 03:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
and let me know if anything happens
 
03:33:25.349 --> 03:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
so it took me about a week and during
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
the course of that illness which it
 
03:33:27.670 --> 03:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
could have been a cold it could have
 
03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
been covered it could have been the flu
 
03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
these treatments treat them all
 
03:33:35.190 --> 03:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
i realized my vitamin d level was low
 
03:33:36.950 --> 03:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
what i was taking to supplement wasn't
 
03:33:36.960 --> 03:33:38.150 align:start position:0%
what i was taking to supplement wasn't
enough

03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
enough
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
i boosted it up
 
03:33:42.150 --> 03:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
the next day my symptoms were completely
 
03:33:42.160 --> 03:33:43.030 align:start position:0%
the next day my symptoms were completely
gone

03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
gone
 
03:33:45.269 --> 03:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
i did the right thing by staying home i
 
03:33:48.150 --> 03:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
didn't go out and if i was working
 
03:33:50.229 --> 03:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
as i had always done in the past if i
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
had woken up with any symptoms i would
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
take responsibility and not go into work
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
i've been in contact with nurses around
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
the country
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
they say now the unvaccinated
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
workers have to wear n95s all the time
 
03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
this is a very difficult thing to do for
 
03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
any length of time
 
03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
that the vaccinated nurses don't have to
 
03:34:12.870 --> 03:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
be tested
 
03:34:14.309 --> 03:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
and in fact they're the ones getting
 
03:34:17.670 --> 03:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
sick during the course of their shift
 
03:34:19.990 --> 03:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
and even kind of bragging about it being
 
03:34:22.630 --> 03:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
arrogant about it
 
03:34:24.630 --> 03:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
they don't care that they could possibly
 
03:34:25.830 --> 03:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
be putting somebody else their
 
03:34:27.750 --> 03:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
co-workers or their patients
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
because they are kind of getting away
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you for
 
03:34:36.710 --> 03:34:36.720 align:start position:0%

03:34:36.720 --> 03:34:39.110 align:start position:0%
your testimony any questions of the
presenter

03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%

03:34:40.870 --> 03:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much pink
 
03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:42.800 align:start position:0%

here so would go to mr uh ken
 
03:34:48.950 --> 03:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
hiring and then karen sweeting
 
03:34:48.960 --> 03:34:50.229 align:start position:0%
hiring and then karen sweeting
ken

03:34:50.229 --> 03:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
ken
 
03:34:52.870 --> 03:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
you're recognized i thank you
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
to this honorable body
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
i urge you to support this bill
 
03:35:01.590 --> 03:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like i wish it would be for all
 
03:35:04.150 --> 03:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
organizations and companies
 
03:35:04.160 --> 03:35:05.590 align:start position:0%
organizations and companies
but

03:35:05.590 --> 03:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know i still support this bill
 
03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
because it's important
 
03:35:11.429 --> 03:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
everything that i said on the previous
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill i don't want to repeat but that's
 
03:35:15.910 --> 03:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
the basis of why i'm here
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
i want to emphasize that
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
no one should be compelled to take an
 
03:35:21.429 --> 03:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
experimental vaccine
 
03:35:23.830 --> 03:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
the vaccines that are available now
 
03:35:25.590 --> 03:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
that people are being injected with all
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
of them are experimental
 
03:35:29.830 --> 03:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
pfizer has an approved vaccine called
 
03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:31.429 align:start position:0%
pfizer has an approved vaccine called
kubernate

03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
kubernate
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
that is not available in the country
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
forcing somebody to take that
 
03:35:42.070 --> 03:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:42.080 --> 03:35:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:35:42.870 --> 03:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
covet death statistics that were used
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
to justify
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
this pandemic
 
03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
the cdc has gone back and adjusted those
 
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
numbers and
 
03:35:56.950 --> 03:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
people who were previously declared to
 
03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
have died
 
03:35:59.349 --> 03:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
from coven
 
03:36:01.830 --> 03:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
94 of those people are now declared to
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
have died with coped and that they died
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
if you look at the death
 
03:36:14.160 --> 03:36:15.429 align:start position:0%
if you look at the death
deaths

03:36:15.429 --> 03:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
totals by year over the past five years
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there is no death spike
 
03:36:22.950 --> 03:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
based on any
 
03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
like based on code or for any other
 
03:36:24.640 --> 03:36:26.229 align:start position:0%
like based on code or for any other
reason

03:36:26.229 --> 03:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
so that justifies
 
03:36:32.950 --> 03:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that they change the numbers
 
03:36:34.710 --> 03:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
to reflect the fact that most of these
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
people didn't die from coven
 
03:36:40.630 --> 03:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
it can be and like i said earlier kobe
 
03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
can be treated with other natural
 
03:36:44.710 --> 03:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
treatments or not natural treatments but
 
03:36:47.349 --> 03:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
cheap and effective treatments
 
03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
and it's important to realize that so
 
03:36:51.510 --> 03:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
this bill which would which would be to
 
03:36:56.389 --> 03:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
prevent people from being
 
03:36:58.870 --> 03:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
forced to take a vaccination before they
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
would be hired
 
03:37:02.870 --> 03:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
goes against all reason and logic and i
 
03:37:02.880 --> 03:37:04.070 align:start position:0%
goes against all reason and logic and i
know

03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:37:05.590 --> 03:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
if you haven't read all the things that
 
03:37:07.590 --> 03:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
i've read from all the experts the true
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
experts the people who have invented the
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
technology and the people who have been
 
03:37:12.870 --> 03:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
there in the trenches
 
03:37:14.830 --> 03:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
it might be hard to believe
 
03:37:17.510 --> 03:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
that but i encourage you to do so and if
 
03:37:19.510 --> 03:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
you have questions
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to uh to provide any data
 
03:37:24.070 --> 03:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to see
 
03:37:26.070 --> 03:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
i again i ask that you support this bill
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's important it's a basic human right
 
03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
to determine what gets injected into
 
03:37:31.590 --> 03:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
your body and there should be no
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
restraints on or
 
03:37:35.830 --> 03:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
you should not be have to be coerced
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
into doing so in order to have
 
03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
employment so you could put food on the
 
03:37:41.190 --> 03:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
table for your family thank you
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you justin any questions
 
03:37:46.630 --> 03:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
sitting down thank you
 
03:37:55.269 --> 03:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:57.030 --> 03:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for all
 
03:37:59.349 --> 03:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to hear my
 
03:38:01.110 --> 03:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
03:38:03.429 --> 03:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
i'm actually representing myself as a
 
03:38:04.870 --> 03:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
resident of the lakes region of new
 
03:38:04.880 --> 03:38:06.630 align:start position:0%
resident of the lakes region of new
hampshire

03:38:06.630 --> 03:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know as i sit and listen to all the
 
03:38:10.229 --> 03:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
different testimonies
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
this isn't about republican or democrat
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
this isn't about vaccinated or not
 
03:38:14.160 --> 03:38:16.630 align:start position:0%
this isn't about vaccinated or not
vaccinated

03:38:16.630 --> 03:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know this is really about
 
03:38:20.790 --> 03:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
what is the real problem here
 
03:38:24.790 --> 03:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's a man-made synthetic s-spike
 
03:38:28.070 --> 03:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
protein that was created in a wuham lab
 
03:38:29.110 --> 03:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
i've been a pharmaceutical
 
03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative for 18 years and it's not
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
about conspiracy theory it's about can
 
03:38:35.910 --> 03:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
we all just do our due diligence to do
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
the research so when i was forced and
 
03:38:40.229 --> 03:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
faced with the decision to either keep
 
03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
my job or get a vaccination
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
i was terminated from my job it was not
 
03:38:47.349 --> 03:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
honored the opportunity through title
 
03:38:50.870 --> 03:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
vii of the u.s constitution the right to
 
03:38:52.630 --> 03:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
be accommodated for a religious or
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
medical exemption and i was denied that
 
03:38:56.239 --> 03:38:57.110 align:start position:0%
medical exemption and i was denied that
so

03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
i've spoken spent the last 18 years
 
03:39:01.750 --> 03:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
educating cardiologists hematologists
 
03:39:03.990 --> 03:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
oncologists on how the mechanism of
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
action of medications work and thank god
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
we have medications when they're needed
 
03:39:10.870 --> 03:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
and appropriate and necessary
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
but at what cost do the benefits or the
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
risks what's what's the ratio how many
 
03:39:18.070 --> 03:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
people need to die how many people need
 
03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
to be injured where there's no
 
03:39:21.670 --> 03:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
accountability for any of these deaths
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
or any of these injuries and then people
 
03:39:24.870 --> 03:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
are losing their jobs in their
 
03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:26.150 align:start position:0%
are losing their jobs in their
livelihood

03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
livelihood
 
03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
so i i just want us to figure out how do
 
03:39:32.229 --> 03:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
we really step back and look at what is
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
the real problem here
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
the problem is we don't have accurate
 
03:39:38.469 --> 03:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
information out in the mainstream media
 
03:39:40.070 --> 03:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
of what these vaccines are really all
 
03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
about they're not vaccines it's a gene
 
03:39:41.760 --> 03:39:44.229 align:start position:0%
about they're not vaccines it's a gene
therapy

03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's a gene therapy and so if there's
 
03:39:47.990 --> 03:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
people that have been vaccinated or not
 
03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:49.830 align:start position:0%
people that have been vaccinated or not
vaccinated

03:39:49.830 --> 03:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
03:39:51.429 --> 03:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
if you've been vaccinated why are you
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
worried about anyone that's not been
 
03:39:52.800 --> 03:39:56.309 align:start position:0%
worried about anyone that's not been
vaccinated

03:39:56.309 --> 03:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
why does anthony fauci have profits and
 
03:40:01.750 --> 03:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
royalties in the modern patent
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
why does the cdd cdc have investments
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the pfizer and or modern vaccines
 
03:40:11.990 --> 03:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
this doesn't make sense at what cost
 
03:40:14.710 --> 03:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
does the the human life
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
what is i'm just dumbfounded and
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
devastated of what's happening not only
 
03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire but in our
 
03:40:20.319 --> 03:40:21.990 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire but in our
country

03:40:21.990 --> 03:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
country
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's just really really unfortunate and
 
03:40:25.510 --> 03:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
i can only hope and pray that we are
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
able to come up so these vaccines and
 
03:40:29.429 --> 03:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
these vaccine mandates i am totally
 
03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
against the vaccine mandates i'm against
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccines and i just hope and pray
 
03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
that as this these bills are brought
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
forward whether it's the the mandate i
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
support both bills here today
 
03:40:42.870 --> 03:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
there should be no mandates so much
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
someone should have to decide on whether
 
03:40:46.389 --> 03:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
they take a vaccine where
 
03:40:48.070 --> 03:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be informed consent go
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
to any pharmacy ask them to show you the
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
package insert of any of these vaccines
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
why do they not list the ingredients
 
03:40:57.830 --> 03:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
that are in these vaccines
 
03:40:59.429 --> 03:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
if they are safe and effective i think
 
03:41:01.030 --> 03:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
anyone that says that they are safe and
 
03:41:02.950 --> 03:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
effective is because they're getting
 
03:41:05.189 --> 03:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
federal fund from the cares act
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i understand and i feel for any of
 
03:41:08.150 --> 03:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
these administrators that are dealing
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
with nurses associations or hospital
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
associations you need funds to keep your
 
03:41:16.870 --> 03:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
organizations going but at what cost
 
03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's the overreach of our government
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what the us constitution is
 
03:41:20.880 --> 03:41:22.070 align:start position:0%
and that's what the us constitution is
for

03:41:22.070 --> 03:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:41:24.070 --> 03:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
so i support both of these bills that
 
03:41:25.990 --> 03:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
are here for us today i'll take any
 
03:41:28.710 --> 03:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any thank you for
 
03:41:33.189 --> 03:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
for your time sitting on thank you very
 
03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
for your time sitting on thank you very
much

03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
it's the last card i have anyone else
 
03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:54.720 --> 03:41:56.309 align:start position:0%
 
behind

03:41:56.309 --> 03:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
behind
 
03:41:57.510 --> 03:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
you could try to be brief sir i
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:06.309 --> 03:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
i'm gary york from hopkinton new
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire sadly
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
as a physician i have to admit that the
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
medical profession has kind of failed us
 
03:42:14.950 --> 03:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
over the past couple of years
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
and it may be for a number of reasons
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
but when i first started my practice it
 
03:42:22.229 --> 03:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
was a private practice group most of the
 
03:42:24.389 --> 03:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
other clinical practices were private
 
03:42:24.399 --> 03:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
other clinical practices were private
practice

03:42:25.510 --> 03:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
over years up to
 
03:42:31.269 --> 03:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
the time of my retirement six years ago
 
03:42:33.110 --> 03:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
physicians gradually
 
03:42:35.830 --> 03:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
had to join corporate medicine these
 
03:42:35.840 --> 03:42:36.630 align:start position:0%
had to join corporate medicine these
were

03:42:36.630 --> 03:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
individually hospital owned medical
 
03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:39.990 align:start position:0%
individually hospital owned medical
groups

03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
groups
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
they were forced into that over time
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
because insurance companies would not
 
03:42:46.389 --> 03:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
reimburse private practice people and
 
03:42:48.150 --> 03:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
the more competitive rates were to be
 
03:42:53.030 --> 03:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
some of the decisions made by these uh
 
03:42:57.990 --> 03:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
corporations now are from administrators
 
03:43:00.790 --> 03:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
from on high
 
03:43:02.950 --> 03:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
and things like mandates and
 
03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
requirements that medical staff be
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
vaccinated come from
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
administrators and other
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:16.960 --> 03:43:19.269 align:start position:0%
 
organization

03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
organization
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
if physicians
 
03:43:21.120 --> 03:43:22.070 align:start position:0%
if physicians
are

03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
here's here's the problem
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
physicians were afraid to
 
03:43:29.750 --> 03:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
allow early treatment for covid and
 
03:43:31.110 --> 03:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
there were there were
 
03:43:33.349 --> 03:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
treatments known
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
for fear of
 
03:43:36.790 --> 03:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
not following
 
03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
guidelines by the corrupt cdc
 
03:43:42.870 --> 03:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
center for disease control disease
 
03:43:44.950 --> 03:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
control do you think that in two years
 
03:43:46.950 --> 03:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
the center for disease control would
 
03:43:49.830 --> 03:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
have had any widespread nationwide
 
03:43:52.150 --> 03:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
clinical trials for early treatment of
 
03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
covid no
 
03:43:55.030 --> 03:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
because we haven't we have to push the
 
03:43:55.040 --> 03:43:56.309 align:start position:0%
because we haven't we have to push the
vaccine

03:43:56.309 --> 03:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're not going to allow things like
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
vitamin i hybrid mechanism we're not
 
03:44:01.269 --> 03:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
going to do that
 
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
we have to get the vaccine out
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
way that the nation has handled this
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
across the past two years has been a
 
03:44:14.790 --> 03:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
real failure
 
03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
and from i could give a number of
 
03:44:19.670 --> 03:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
different examples but from a medical
 
03:44:22.150 --> 03:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
professional standpoint
 
03:44:23.189 --> 03:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:44:24.469 --> 03:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
physicians are
 
03:44:26.229 --> 03:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
number one they're coerced they can't
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
speak freely
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
for fear of losing their job and these
 
03:44:32.309 --> 03:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
are mandates that are being
 
03:44:34.389 --> 03:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
come down from
 
03:44:39.670 --> 03:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:42.150 --> 03:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
03:44:45.110 --> 03:44:45.120 align:start position:0%

representative huff

thank you mr chairman and honorable
 
03:46:19.349 --> 03:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:19.359 --> 03:46:21.269 align:start position:0%
 
1352

03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
1352
 
03:46:21.279 --> 03:46:24.550 align:start position:0%
1352
is

03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:27.429 --> 03:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
another covet build
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the the chair for
 
03:46:31.030 --> 03:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
putting these all together because a lot
 
03:46:32.790 --> 03:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
of questions
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
are answered and we get a lot of insight
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:42.630 --> 03:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's a simple premise and that is
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
is that this bill provides that if an
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
adverse reaction happens
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
and we've seen today and we've heard
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:56.309 --> 03:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
if an employer is to mandate
 
03:46:57.750 --> 03:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
a vaccine
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:47:01.510 --> 03:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
term of keeping your job
 
03:47:04.710 --> 03:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
and something happens
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
this would be able to have the person
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
who is harmed
 
03:47:15.189 --> 03:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.189 --> 03:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
a couple of points i'd like to make out
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
just to give you an idea
 
03:47:24.870 --> 03:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
since 1989
 
03:47:27.030 --> 03:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
the average number of all vaccine
 
03:47:28.950 --> 03:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
related deaths in new hampshire that
 
03:47:28.960 --> 03:47:30.070 align:start position:0%
related deaths in new hampshire that
were

03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:47:30.080 --> 03:47:31.510 align:start position:0%
were
reported

03:47:31.510 --> 03:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
reported
 
03:47:31.520 --> 03:47:32.950 align:start position:0%
reported
combined

03:47:32.950 --> 03:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
combined
 
03:47:34.870 --> 03:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's over 32 years
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
is somewhere in the neighborhood of
 
03:47:39.269 --> 03:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
about 10 a year
 
03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
in the first seven months of the coveted
 
03:47:41.359 --> 03:47:42.550 align:start position:0%
in the first seven months of the coveted
vaccines

03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
03:47:45.910 --> 03:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
55 people in new hampshire had died
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's in two-thirds of a year
 
03:47:53.670 --> 03:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
and and that kind of result has happened
 
03:47:56.070 --> 03:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
this comes from the the affairs site the
 
03:47:56.080 --> 03:47:57.750 align:start position:0%
this comes from the the affairs site the
cdc

03:47:57.750 --> 03:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
cdc
 
03:47:57.760 --> 03:47:59.510 align:start position:0%
cdc
fda

03:47:59.510 --> 03:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
fda
 
03:48:01.110 --> 03:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
the premise here is if businesses are
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
going to force workers
 
03:48:02.640 --> 03:48:04.070 align:start position:0%
going to force workers
people

03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:48:06.150 --> 03:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
to inject their bodies with potentially
 
03:48:08.070 --> 03:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous chemicals
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
as a condition of employment
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
then they should bear responsibility for
 
03:48:16.229 --> 03:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:18.070 --> 03:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
and as in as you heard in earlier
 
03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
testimony i just want to emphasize a
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
point here because
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.239 --> 03:48:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
in labor
 
03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
we try not to stand in between employer
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
and employee
 
03:48:34.229 --> 03:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
and i want to emphasize that we don't
 
03:48:38.070 --> 03:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
but since it's the employer's decision
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
to adopt such a policy a policy that may
 
03:48:44.309 --> 03:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
injure people
 
03:48:46.389 --> 03:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
in ways that we can't predict or even
 
03:48:48.630 --> 03:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
understand yet
 
03:48:50.150 --> 03:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
then the employer should have the
 
03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:52.389 align:start position:0%
then the employer should have the
responsibility

03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
if harm comes to those employees
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
so this would just simply
 
03:48:59.590 --> 03:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
give the employees
 
03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
some sort of relief
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
in the case of an adverse reaction and
 
03:49:06.630 --> 03:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
with that i'll take any questions
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:14.070 --> 03:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman mr chairman and thank
 
03:49:14.950 --> 03:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative two quick questions if
 
03:49:19.349 --> 03:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
you don't mind um
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
one in line well throughout the the bill
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
it mentions covet 19. is there any
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
reason why you've limited it to covet 19
 
03:49:28.630 --> 03:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
and not
 
03:49:30.630 --> 03:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
injections or other
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the for the question um
 
03:49:39.670 --> 03:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's the thing that was on the mind i
 
03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
would absolutely be open to an amendment
 
03:49:43.910 --> 03:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
to to make that a little bit more broad
 
03:49:43.920 --> 03:49:44.710 align:start position:0%
to to make that a little bit more broad
for

03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
any any type of forced or required
 
03:49:48.960 --> 03:49:52.469 align:start position:0%
any any type of forced or required
injections

03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:52.479 --> 03:49:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your answer and
 
03:49:57.030 --> 03:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh the only other question is
 
03:49:57.040 --> 03:50:00.150 align:start position:0%
uh the only other question is
um

03:50:00.150 --> 03:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
who were what would be the determining
 
03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:04.150 align:start position:0%
who were what would be the determining
individual

03:50:04.150 --> 03:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:50:06.389 --> 03:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
to determine if the actual
 
03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
reaction adverse reaction was caused by
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:18.790 --> 03:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
that would have to be
 
03:50:21.189 --> 03:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
from a physician i would assume
 
03:50:23.269 --> 03:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
um i didn't have that in here
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
specifically because an adverse reaction
 
03:50:28.870 --> 03:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:28.880 --> 03:50:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
a

03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
a number of things we've heard different
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
degrees of adverse reactions from uh
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
actually getting the flu
 
03:50:40.389 --> 03:50:40.399 align:start position:0%
all the way to death and in
 
03:50:40.399 --> 03:50:41.349 align:start position:0%
all the way to death and in
uh

03:50:41.349 --> 03:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:50:43.510 --> 03:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
i believe uh gion
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
bears disease
 
03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:46.070 align:start position:0%
bears disease
ra

03:50:46.070 --> 03:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
ra
 
03:50:48.070 --> 03:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
and a lot of other different things so i
 
03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
think it would be something that would
 
03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
manifest itself
 
03:50:52.389 --> 03:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
after you got it you would go to your
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
physician and if that there was
 
03:50:56.710 --> 03:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
something wrong then that would be
 
03:50:58.870 --> 03:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
the determining factor on whether or not
 
03:51:05.110 --> 03:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
03:51:12.389 --> 03:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for members of the committee
 
03:51:14.229 --> 03:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
next i'd like to
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
call on
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner rudy ogden
 
03:51:22.150 --> 03:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
he is neither in support or in
 
03:51:28.710 --> 03:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh thank you
 
03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth i'm happy to
 
03:51:33.990 --> 03:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions one thing that we
 
03:51:35.830 --> 03:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
did want to comment on relative to this
 
03:51:37.349 --> 03:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
bill because we have had certain
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
questions come in relative to the
 
03:51:41.510 --> 03:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation is first just in
 
03:51:44.229 --> 03:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
terms of context it is important to know
 
03:51:44.239 --> 03:51:45.189 align:start position:0%
terms of context it is important to know
that

03:51:45.189 --> 03:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:51:47.110 --> 03:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
even if there is no legislative change
 
03:51:49.349 --> 03:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
here these types of adverse reactions at
 
03:51:51.269 --> 03:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
least on an arguable basis would be
 
03:51:53.110 --> 03:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
compensable under workers comp and what
 
03:51:55.110 --> 03:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
i mean by that is under existing law
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
under existing application of law if
 
03:52:00.229 --> 03:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
someone has a flu shot as is required by
 
03:52:02.229 --> 03:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
their employer and they have an adverse
 
03:52:04.870 --> 03:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
reaction they can make a claim for
 
03:52:07.030 --> 03:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
workers comp benefits under existing law
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
so i just want to be very clear that
 
03:52:09.990 --> 03:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
there is an existing mechanism or
 
03:52:12.550 --> 03:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
apparatus for those claims to be made
 
03:52:14.550 --> 03:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
that being said if what the intent here
 
03:52:16.950 --> 03:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
is to put in place a presumption
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
there are other places in workers comp
 
03:52:23.110 --> 03:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
law namely a given example of 281 a17c
 
03:52:24.870 --> 03:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
where there is a presumption put into
 
03:52:27.189 --> 03:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
law saying that if a first responder or
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's actually an emergency
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
responder has ptsd or acute stress
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
disorder that condition is presumed to
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
be occupationally related i'd point out
 
03:52:38.150 --> 03:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
that the use of the word presumed is
 
03:52:40.229 --> 03:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
impactful in the sense that presumed
 
03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
under workers comp law it typically
 
03:52:44.229 --> 03:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
means that okay there's a presumption
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
that it's occupationally related but the
 
03:52:48.150 --> 03:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
employer or more specifically their
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
carrier could still deny the claim if
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
they felt that they were entitled to
 
03:52:54.150 --> 03:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
rebut the presumption so essentially
 
03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
what a presumption does is it shifts the
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
balance from okay i'm the claimant i
 
03:53:01.670 --> 03:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
need to make and pursue my claim to
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
instead saying okay the employer needs
 
03:53:05.670 --> 03:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
to deny the claim and they have the
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
burden to discount it so i just want to
 
03:53:10.950 --> 03:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
put out there that if the intent here is
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
to put in a presumption
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
arguably it might be better served to
 
03:53:16.389 --> 03:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
use the presumption language that's
 
03:53:17.990 --> 03:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the law as that might be
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
more easily applied the other thing that
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
we point out relative to a concern or
 
03:53:24.870 --> 03:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
consideration relative to ongoing
 
03:53:24.880 --> 03:53:26.790 align:start position:0%
consideration relative to ongoing
administration

03:53:26.790 --> 03:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:53:29.110 --> 03:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
we had questions concerning the language
 
03:53:31.110 --> 03:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
quote shall be eligible if i look at
 
03:53:31.120 --> 03:53:33.429 align:start position:0%
quote shall be eligible if i look at
lines

03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
lines
 
03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
bear with me for one second line six and
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
seven of the proposed bill where it says
 
03:53:39.830 --> 03:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
quote shall be eligible for workers comp
 
03:53:42.309 --> 03:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
benefits under the chapter we would just
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
be seeking guidance or i think perhaps
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
additional clarity what exactly is the
 
03:53:48.630 --> 03:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
extent of that how expansive are we to
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
take that does that mean that if there
 
03:53:52.469 --> 03:53:52.479 align:start position:0%
was an adverse reaction that the
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
individual having that adverse reaction
 
03:53:56.150 --> 03:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
would be entitled to any and all
 
03:53:58.710 --> 03:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
benefits forever
 
03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
again i think that that's why again it
 
03:54:02.389 --> 03:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
might be worth referencing or looking to
 
03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
the presumption language because under
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
the presumption language it's presumed i
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
would say in practice most presumed
 
03:54:11.830 --> 03:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
injuries or incidents they're accepted
 
03:54:13.750 --> 03:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
as claims and you'll have the follow-on
 
03:54:15.750 --> 03:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
payment or care from the carrier but
 
03:54:17.590 --> 03:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
under the presumption model the carrier
 
03:54:19.110 --> 03:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
or the employer does still have the
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
right to issue or make denials and again
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
that would address under this existing
 
03:54:25.429 --> 03:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
language we just have questions over
 
03:54:28.150 --> 03:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
whether any claim could ever be denied
 
03:54:30.150 --> 03:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
so again say there's an adverse reaction
 
03:54:32.229 --> 03:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
say i missed some work say i have a
 
03:54:34.389 --> 03:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
couple medical appointments but what if
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
three months later i put in another you
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
know okay now i want to get this done or
 
03:54:40.870 --> 03:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
i want to get that done so i would just
 
03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
put out there that under this proposed
 
03:54:45.269 --> 03:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
legislation the department would say
 
03:54:48.070 --> 03:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
arguably anything that the person seeks
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
and says in some way flows from that
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
adverse reaction they'd be entitled to
 
03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to take any questions but
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to offer that context
 
03:54:57.670 --> 03:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that i will
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
recognize representative prout and then
 
03:55:03.189 --> 03:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question um
 
03:55:08.950 --> 03:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
you stated earlier that uh if someone
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
has an adverse reaction to other
 
03:55:11.910 --> 03:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines say that you i think use the
 
03:55:14.070 --> 03:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
example the flu shot it will be
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
evaluated under where comes compensation
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh today is that only if the employer
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
had mandated that flu shot i assume
 
03:55:23.990 --> 03:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
no so again in the general sense if the
 
03:55:26.550 --> 03:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
person is saying that there
 
03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
have an injury and workers comp the
 
03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
issue or the evaluation is always is it
 
03:55:32.790 --> 03:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
occupationally related if the person
 
03:55:34.710 --> 03:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
made the claim that
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
i got this flu shot because of work
 
03:55:38.630 --> 03:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's what made it more likely for me
 
03:55:39.910 --> 03:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
to get it
 
03:55:41.750 --> 03:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
to get the flu shot
 
03:55:43.590 --> 03:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
even if it wasn't mandated i think that
 
03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
you could have an argument but certainly
 
03:55:46.630 --> 03:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
under the mandate and you'd have a
 
03:55:48.950 --> 03:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
stronger argument
 
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:55:50.160 --> 03:55:51.750 align:start position:0%
follow up
um

03:55:51.750 --> 03:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer um
 
03:55:53.760 --> 03:55:54.550 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer um
so

03:55:54.550 --> 03:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:57.990 --> 03:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
do you see a section b or c of the bill
 
03:56:00.550 --> 03:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
which specify non-mandate related
 
03:56:03.030 --> 03:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
enticements as qualifying as adding
 
03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
anything to that evaluation or is that
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
already completely covered on the
 
03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
existing framework that you were just
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
speaking about
 
03:56:12.630 --> 03:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
again we were looking at b and c of the
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation as kind of defining
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
the parameters of what a mandate is so
 
03:56:18.630 --> 03:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
mandate was not just a strict it's
 
03:56:20.469 --> 03:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
required but a mandate would also be
 
03:56:24.150 --> 03:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
taken as an incentive or enticement so
 
03:56:25.349 --> 03:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't know if i'm answering
 
03:56:26.710 --> 03:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
your questions but i don't know that it
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily changes uh the analysis or
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
would change anything under
 
03:56:33.510 --> 03:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
existing law it would just make it more
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
clear that it's
 
03:56:35.040 --> 03:56:36.550 align:start position:0%
clear that it's
required

03:56:36.550 --> 03:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
being here
 
03:56:47.349 --> 03:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner
 
03:56:47.359 --> 03:56:49.510 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner
um

03:56:49.510 --> 03:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
you referred to adverse reactions who
 
03:56:52.560 --> 03:56:53.830 align:start position:0%
you referred to adverse reactions who
determines

03:56:53.830 --> 03:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
determines
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
whether a
 
03:56:58.630 --> 03:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
medical condition after a vaccination
 
03:57:01.429 --> 03:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
for a flu or for covid who determines
 
03:57:03.910 --> 03:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
whether some medical condition is indeed
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
an adverse reaction or just a
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
coincidental medical condition
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
so i thank you for the question
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan representative
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
turcotte had asked a question along that
 
03:57:16.870 --> 03:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
those lines earlier
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the proposed legislation it
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
does define an adverse reaction sickness
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
disease trauma injury or condition
 
03:57:23.279 --> 03:57:24.630 align:start position:0%
disease trauma injury or condition
arising

03:57:24.630 --> 03:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
arising
 
03:57:27.110 --> 03:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
so basically if they were not sick
 
03:57:29.750 --> 03:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
before and now they're sick
 
03:57:31.189 --> 03:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately you would need some
 
03:57:32.950 --> 03:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
determination likely from a medical
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
provider or something in which they're
 
03:57:37.110 --> 03:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
able to then say okay that's supporting
 
03:57:39.189 --> 03:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
a report of this injury or report of
 
03:57:41.349 --> 03:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
this reaction i do think that the
 
03:57:43.510 --> 03:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
department in evaluating those things
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
would not just be looking from someone
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
saying they felt sick i think they would
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
like some type of
 
03:57:51.189 --> 03:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
likely a provider making some type of
 
03:57:55.590 --> 03:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative infantine
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:58:02.550 --> 03:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
mr ogden
 
03:58:06.710 --> 03:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:08.469 --> 03:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
where in law
 
03:58:10.550 --> 03:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
would we find that and the reason why i
 
03:58:10.560 --> 03:58:11.429 align:start position:0%
would we find that and the reason why i
ask

03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
ask
 
03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
is would would the same thing occur if
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
you removed the word shall in line six
 
03:58:18.870 --> 03:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
to may
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
or would you just strike that all
 
03:58:22.469 --> 03:58:22.479 align:start position:0%
together and what was the other language
 
03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
the presumptive language and where is
 
03:58:25.590 --> 03:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
that found in law
 
03:58:25.600 --> 03:58:26.630 align:start position:0%
that found in law
so

03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
and i would look at there's a couple
 
03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
different places the one that i
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
specifically reference in my testimony
 
03:58:36.389 --> 03:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
is 281 a17c
 
03:58:38.950 --> 03:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
and it just literally in talking about
 
03:58:41.189 --> 03:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
first responders or emergency responders
 
03:58:43.030 --> 03:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
and acute stress disorder just puts out
 
03:58:44.950 --> 03:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
that there shall be a presumption
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
that it's occupationally related i think
 
03:58:48.870 --> 03:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
the use of presumption is purposeful in
 
03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
the sense that that's a known legal term
 
03:58:53.670 --> 03:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's come up in the context of
 
03:58:55.349 --> 03:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
comp claims and
 
03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
whether you know all the way up to the
 
03:58:58.870 --> 03:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
supreme court that you know if there's a
 
03:59:01.110 --> 03:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
presumption uh the important thing is
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
the presumption
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
shifts the burden it's assumed or
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
presumed that it's occupationally
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
related but still the carrier employer
 
03:59:11.510 --> 03:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
would have the wherewithal to say for
 
03:59:13.349 --> 03:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
certain reasons the presumption could be
 
03:59:15.269 --> 03:59:15.279 align:start position:0%
rebutted so i don't know if that answers
 
03:59:17.830 --> 03:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
your question but it's elsewhere in law
 
03:59:20.469 --> 03:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of in 281 a there are certain
 
03:59:23.670 --> 03:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
sections also 281 a17 dealing with heart
 
03:59:25.030 --> 03:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
and lung disease there's a couple
 
03:59:27.429 --> 03:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
different areas mainly in the first
 
03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
responder context dealing with
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
presumptions of occupational uh related
 
03:59:31.840 --> 03:59:34.950 align:start position:0%
presumptions of occupational uh related
hazards

03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:36.950 --> 03:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
please follow up
 
03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
mr ogden i'm just concerned
 
03:59:41.429 --> 03:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
with making this presumptive
 
03:59:43.910 --> 03:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
03:59:46.229 --> 03:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
and going back to a regular type of
 
03:59:46.239 --> 03:59:48.630 align:start position:0%
and going back to a regular type of
claim

03:59:48.630 --> 03:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
claim
 
03:59:48.640 --> 03:59:49.590 align:start position:0%
claim
where

03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
someone makes a claim insurance company
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
or the employer does the investigation
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to go back if they
 
03:59:56.550 --> 03:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
don't get the result they want they can
 
03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
go for a hearing with you folks so i go
 
04:00:00.870 --> 04:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
back to my
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
line six without putting this into a
 
04:00:03.520 --> 04:00:05.269 align:start position:0%
line six without putting this into a
presumptive

04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
presumptive
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
part of the law
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:14.950 --> 04:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
solve some of your concerns whether it's
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
a guarantee
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
that you will get the benefits
 
04:00:17.680 --> 04:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
that you will get the benefits
regardless

04:00:19.830 --> 04:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
in response to that i'd say if you want
 
04:00:24.389 --> 04:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
it to be a guarantee i think the shall
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
be considered occupational disease i
 
04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
think that that's workable if you want
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
it as a guarantee i would leave it as
 
04:00:32.550 --> 04:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
shall be the department's concern would
 
04:00:35.429 --> 04:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
then be the following shall shall be
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for workers comp if that was
 
04:00:39.990 --> 04:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
changed to a may that would address our
 
04:00:40.000 --> 04:00:41.189 align:start position:0%
changed to a may that would address our
concern

04:00:41.189 --> 04:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:00:43.349 --> 04:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of administration going forward
 
04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
is is there ever an opportunity for
 
04:00:44.960 --> 04:00:45.990 align:start position:0%
is is there ever an opportunity for
denial

04:00:45.990 --> 04:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
denial
 
04:00:47.429 --> 04:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
that's what that's where i met the first
 
04:00:47.439 --> 04:00:48.790 align:start position:0%
that's what that's where i met the first
all right

04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative abellani
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner um would there be a
 
04:00:59.590 --> 04:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
time frame on this
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
typical workman's case
 
04:01:03.429 --> 04:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
workman's comp places have to be claimed
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
within 48 hours of injury
 
04:01:07.030 --> 04:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
where is the timeline where what would
 
04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
you be looking for for guidance on a
 
04:01:10.150 --> 04:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
timeline for this
 
04:01:10.160 --> 04:01:10.950 align:start position:0%
timeline for this
well

04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
this does not in any way
 
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
for our review alter the existing time
 
04:01:17.189 --> 04:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
frames for reporting injury so i think
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
that you'd be within that you know the
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
18-month type of you have 18 months for
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
appeal but you're looking for the
 
04:01:25.510 --> 04:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
employer to report within five days
 
04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
but the employer doesn't necessarily
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
report until they're notified by the
 
04:01:31.349 --> 04:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
employees so i don't think this changes
 
04:01:32.950 --> 04:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
any of those timelines so we wouldn't be
 
04:01:34.150 --> 04:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
looking for anything special or
 
04:01:34.160 --> 04:01:35.429 align:start position:0%
looking for anything special or
particular

04:01:35.429 --> 04:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
it would just be do you have a notice of
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
injury reported are they seeking the
 
04:01:42.389 --> 04:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
claim within 18 months
 
04:01:48.150 --> 04:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:49.750 --> 04:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr ogden
 
04:02:01.269 --> 04:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
how would one determine like if six
 
04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
eight months down the road after the
 
04:02:06.710 --> 04:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination someone had a heart attack
 
04:02:09.189 --> 04:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
people have heart attacks or strokes how
 
04:02:11.030 --> 04:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
would we determine that that was caused
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
by a
 
04:02:12.840 --> 04:02:14.469 align:start position:0%
by a
vaccine

04:02:14.469 --> 04:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
04:02:16.150 --> 04:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good question i think
 
04:02:18.309 --> 04:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
that again with with this what we would
 
04:02:19.750 --> 04:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
be looking for
 
04:02:22.150 --> 04:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
is it is there an adverse reaction
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
within 14 days so we'd be looking for 14
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
days from the vaccine do we have some
 
04:02:29.349 --> 04:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
type of adverse reaction if you're
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:02:32.469 --> 04:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
they've had an adverse reaction and then
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
sometime thereafter they've had a heart
 
04:02:37.510 --> 04:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
attack i think that you would have to
 
04:02:39.510 --> 04:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
tie them together somehow i don't know
 
04:02:41.349 --> 04:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
exactly how they would do that or could
 
04:02:43.349 --> 04:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
do that but they would have to if
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
they're saying the heart attack was
 
04:02:46.229 --> 04:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
related to the earlier injury they would
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
have to make that case or claim
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
04:02:58.630 --> 04:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:03:02.790 --> 04:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
um i have a card here from mr juve
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
who i don't see with us in the room
 
04:03:06.319 --> 04:03:07.990 align:start position:0%
who i don't see with us in the room
um

04:03:07.990 --> 04:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.520 --> 04:03:16.389 align:start position:0%
 
she

04:03:16.389 --> 04:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
she
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
did not mark whether she is in support
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
or oppose the bill so if you could say
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is laura condon
 
04:03:27.910 --> 04:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
again i'm a volunteer director of
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
advocacy with the national vaccine
 
04:03:31.349 --> 04:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
information center and we're an
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
educational resource advocacy
 
04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
and we advocate for informed consent for
 
04:03:35.520 --> 04:03:37.349 align:start position:0%
and we advocate for informed consent for
vaccination

04:03:37.349 --> 04:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
04:03:39.030 --> 04:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
while it is clear this bill has good
 
04:03:40.790 --> 04:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
intentions and i very much appreciate
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
the efforts of the sponsors i have
 
04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill that is written
 
04:03:46.469 --> 04:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
it would actually limit and reduce
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
workers compensation protections already
 
04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
available to employees subject to covet
 
04:03:53.429 --> 04:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates or injured or killed by
 
04:03:55.269 --> 04:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
these mandatory shots
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
specifically my concerns are two points
 
04:03:57.600 --> 04:03:58.389 align:start position:0%
specifically my concerns are two points
here

04:03:58.389 --> 04:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
the 14 day limit for an injury claim
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
will deny many
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
rightful compensation having worked with
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
a vaccine injured for many many years i
 
04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
can attest that many do not immediately
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
recognize the symptoms of vaccine injury
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
14 days can easily pass before the
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
connection is made a person may
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
experience back or shoulder pain that
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
they do not recognize as vaccine related
 
04:04:21.990 --> 04:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
to perhaps a symptom of myocarditis into
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
14 days
 
04:04:25.429 --> 04:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
yet they may later suffer a heart attack
 
04:04:27.830 --> 04:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
serious heart damage or death
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
open beer shows that 110 deaths
 
04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
helps to track the bears reports and it
 
04:04:36.389 --> 04:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
shows here that 110 deaths actually
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
reported at 20 days
 
04:04:44.950 --> 04:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
time limit here
 
04:04:50.070 --> 04:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
um in addition perhaps this bill should
 
04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
be modeled after the national vaccine
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
injury compensation program that allows
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
for claims for injury from vaccines that
 
04:04:57.120 --> 04:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
for claims for injury from vaccines that
occur

04:04:58.150 --> 04:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
occur
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
within three years after first symptoms
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
of the injury
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
this provides for the time to complete
 
04:05:07.590 --> 04:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
necessary medical evaluation and testing
 
04:05:09.750 --> 04:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
number two the bills should provide
 
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
compensation for death
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
to date there have been 22 193
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
reports of deaths in the united states
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
and 64 deaths right here in new
 
04:05:22.389 --> 04:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire following covet vaccination
 
04:05:24.870 --> 04:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is per the the viers reporting
 
04:05:24.880 --> 04:05:26.710 align:start position:0%
this is per the the viers reporting
system

04:05:26.710 --> 04:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:05:28.710 --> 04:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
actual deaths are most certainly much
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
higher than
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
reported to theirs
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
you might ask what is veers viirs is the
 
04:05:37.750 --> 04:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
government's post marketing safety data
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
reporting system now there are those
 
04:05:42.150 --> 04:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
that will cast out on the beers reports
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
and in doing so they would cast out on
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
the very programs that the cdc and the
 
04:05:50.229 --> 04:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
fda rely on to evaluate vaccine safety
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
remember that filing a false mayor's
 
04:05:52.080 --> 04:05:53.030 align:start position:0%
remember that filing a false mayor's
report

04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
is a federal crime if you cast out on
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
the bears reporting system what is the
 
04:05:59.910 --> 04:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
valid safety reporting system for
 
04:06:05.510 --> 04:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:07.750 --> 04:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to mention that the
 
04:06:10.150 --> 04:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
insurance industry is noticing an
 
04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
increase in death claims in this past
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
year and the working age population not
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
those over age 80.
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
earlier this month the life insurance
 
04:06:21.429 --> 04:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
ceo from one america life in indiana
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
reported that deaths are up 40
 
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
among people ages 18 to 64 and most of
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
the claims for deaths are being being
 
04:06:33.269 --> 04:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
filed are not classified as covades
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
what is killing our working age
 
04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
population in such great numbers this
 
04:06:40.150 --> 04:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
past year
 
04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm skipping over some things i can
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
email you to email to you many
 
04:06:46.150 --> 04:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
businesses are choosing not to impose
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
any vaccine mandate even if covid19
 
04:06:51.510 --> 04:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines eventually obtain fda approval

and are made available
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
this may be very wise avoidance of
 
04:06:57.429 --> 04:06:57.439 align:start position:0%
liability for illness disability and
 
04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
death caused by such vaccine mandates
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
many people are unaware that the
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
national childhood vaccine injury act of
 
04:07:07.990 --> 04:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
1986 acknowledged vaccine injury and
 
04:07:10.150 --> 04:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
deaths and it provides a compensation
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
program for those who are injured and
 
04:07:14.070 --> 04:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
killed provides advisory committee and
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
larger shields manufacturers and
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
administrators from liability for harm
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
caused by vaccines
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
while the federal law may shield
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and vaccine administrators
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
from liability for harm
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
this federal law does not provide
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
immunity from liability protection for
 
04:07:33.269 --> 04:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
private businesses organizations schools
 
04:07:35.189 --> 04:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
or associations who may attempt to
 
04:07:37.110 --> 04:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
independently impose their own vaccine
 
04:07:39.750 --> 04:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
requirements absent any law requiring
 
04:07:41.830 --> 04:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
that they do so
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
i understand that many may first think
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
that vaccines are safe and effective and
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
mandating their use will protect their
 
04:07:50.550 --> 04:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
employees customers patrons and yes from
 
04:07:52.870 --> 04:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
the harm of viral illness
 
04:07:54.790 --> 04:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
but the science and reality is much more
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
complicated than that simple sales pitch
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
those who independently mandate the use
 
04:08:01.269 --> 04:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
of cova vaccines will assume the
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
liability of harm that results from many
 
04:08:05.110 --> 04:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
such mandates
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
then there are others who may think that
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
the prep act provides immunity from
 
04:08:11.110 --> 04:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
liability for all cove and 19
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
vaccinators for all covet 19 vaccinators
 
04:08:16.229 --> 04:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
but that's not true either
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
you look to the prep act the prep act
 
04:08:20.550 --> 04:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
provides immunity from liability for
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
licensed health professionals authorized
 
04:08:25.110 --> 04:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
to administer code 19 vaccines and
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
certain other individuals identified by
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
hhs to administer coded vaccines no such
 
04:08:32.950 --> 04:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
immunity from liability has been
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
extended to any and all types of
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
businesses who may impose a covered
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
but is this bill even necessary
 
04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
i see nothing in statute that will
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
prevent the payment of workers
 
04:08:45.510 --> 04:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
compensation claims for all employer
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
workplace mandates including a vaccine
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
mandate while vaccine mandates are new
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
requirements there is no provision that
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
would exclude workers compensation
 
04:08:54.399 --> 04:08:55.349 align:start position:0%
would exclude workers compensation
coverage

04:08:55.349 --> 04:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
i made inquiry to the insurance to new
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire insurance department some
 
04:09:00.790 --> 04:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
months ago and that yielded a
 
04:09:03.189 --> 04:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
non-committal response given the newness
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
of the issue is expected that his
 
04:09:07.590 --> 04:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
employees file claims if there is any
 
04:09:09.429 --> 04:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
dispute about coverage the matter would
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
go to a hearing and they would look to
 
04:09:13.110 --> 04:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
statute for guidance
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
absent any statute limiting or
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
preventing coverage for a workplace
 
04:09:19.349 --> 04:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
requirement that injures it seems
 
04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable to believe that these vaccine
 
04:09:22.870 --> 04:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
injury claims would already be covered
 
04:09:24.790 --> 04:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
by workers compensation
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
and employers who impose these covered
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates may pray that there is
 
04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
workers compensation coverage as it
 
04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
certainly would be expected that an
 
04:09:35.110 --> 04:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
injured employee would have civil case
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
against his or her employer for imposing
 
04:09:39.990 --> 04:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
a vaccine mandate that caused injury
 
04:09:43.030 --> 04:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
disability or death so again
 
04:09:44.550 --> 04:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not convinced that this bill is
 
04:09:46.710 --> 04:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
needed but if you are to consider it at
 
04:09:49.110 --> 04:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
the very least the time frame for filing
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
a claim for injury should be extended to
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
three years the same time frame for
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
finance claim and the federal vaccine
 
04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
injury compensation program
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
and the bills should be amended to
 
04:10:02.229 --> 04:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
clearly cover disability and death
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
not just illness and injury i sincerely
 
04:10:06.710 --> 04:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank the sponsors for bringing this
 
04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
bill forward for discussion
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
employers who are injured by covered
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
child media mandates in the workplace
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
should be filing workers compensation
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
claims and not burning health insurance
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
and paying out of pocket for deductibles
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
and uncovered care
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
they deserve the full coverage of
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
workers compensation and should be
 
04:10:27.670 --> 04:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
filing claims now
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
an employer who imposes a workplace
 
04:10:31.990 --> 04:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
mandate should be liable for the safety
 
04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
of that workplace mandate thank you very
 
04:10:34.159 --> 04:10:34.950 align:start position:0%
of that workplace mandate thank you very
much

04:10:34.950 --> 04:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
04:10:39.110 --> 04:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:10:43.990 --> 04:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
i have a card from paula minahan who
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
represents the new hampshire hospital
 
04:10:45.840 --> 04:10:49.269 align:start position:0%
represents the new hampshire hospital
association

04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:59.110 --> 04:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
04:11:04.389 --> 04:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
paula minihan senior vice president
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
state government relations with the new
 
04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals in the
 
04:11:11.110 --> 04:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
state we do have concerns about this
 
04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
bill and as stated by
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner ogden we
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
there is question for us as to whether
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
or not this bill is even necessary
 
04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
it seems like current law does allow for
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
an individual to file workers comp claim
 
04:11:29.070 --> 04:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
if they had an adverse reaction to an
 
04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
employer-required vaccine
 
04:11:35.590 --> 04:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
what we find confusing it is b and c of
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't the way we read it is it
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
says or so why would an employee file a
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
workers comp claim if an employer
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
imposes additional requirements and who
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
declines to receive a covet vaccine and
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
then if they provide a bonus to an
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
employee it's confusing to us
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i i think that we'll just leave our
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
comments at that i don't think this we
 
04:12:04.070 --> 04:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe this bill is necessary and
 
04:12:06.550 --> 04:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
we do not support it um and thank you
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
for the time
 
04:12:10.389 --> 04:12:10.399 align:start position:0%

you need to step out and get something
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
to eat or drink
 
04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
i'll feel
 
04:15:15.590 --> 04:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
although my mother probably doesn't
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i talk about her it is
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
11 45 and she wants me to be on time
 
04:15:24.309 --> 04:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to open the hearing on
 
04:15:27.110 --> 04:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1358
 
04:15:29.830 --> 04:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
and introduce representative william
 
04:15:29.840 --> 04:15:34.550 align:start position:0%
and introduce representative william
foster

04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:15:37.750 --> 04:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
for the record
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
i am representative william foster from
 
04:15:42.790 --> 04:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county five i'm here today
 
04:15:45.670 --> 04:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:48.070 --> 04:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1358
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
requiring public and private employers
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
to establish procedures and exceptions
 
04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
for the use of mandatory intrusive
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
testing as condition
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.229 --> 04:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
in that the state of new hampshire has
 
04:16:06.070 --> 04:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
affirmed in statute the natural and
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent right
 
04:16:11.349 --> 04:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
to individual body integrity
 
04:16:13.349 --> 04:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
and in that our state constitution
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
proclaims that no subject shall be hurt
 
04:16:17.830 --> 04:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
molested or restrained in his body
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
liberty or state for worshiping god in
 
04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
the manner and season most agreeable to
 
04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
the dictates of his own conscience
 
04:16:27.670 --> 04:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
it is therefore a lot illogical
 
04:16:30.070 --> 04:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
that decisions in regards
 
04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
to each individual's physical body shall
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
be whenever possible the free choice of
 
04:16:36.149 --> 04:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
in a manner most agreeable to the
 
04:16:39.510 --> 04:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
dictates of their own conscience and
 
04:16:39.520 --> 04:16:41.750 align:start position:0%
dictates of their own conscience and
reason

04:16:41.750 --> 04:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
reason
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
it was from this line of reasoning that
 
04:16:48.790 --> 04:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:51.189 --> 04:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
there was not that i could find anywhere
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:54.000 --> 04:16:55.750 align:start position:0%
 
defining

04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
defining
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
what type of testing
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
could be required for employment by the
 
04:17:00.080 --> 04:17:01.349 align:start position:0%
could be required for employment by the
state

04:17:01.349 --> 04:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:17:01.359 --> 04:17:02.070 align:start position:0%
state
or

04:17:02.070 --> 04:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:17:05.110 --> 04:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
by private entities
 
04:17:06.389 --> 04:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
to what
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
depth that
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
testing would go
 
04:17:12.870 --> 04:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
and so the first thing i sought to do
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
with this bill and i seek to do with
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
is to define
 
04:17:17.520 --> 04:17:19.349 align:start position:0%
is to define
um

04:17:19.349 --> 04:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
intrusive testing as meaning any medical
 
04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
testing that requires the penetration or
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
invasion of an individual's body through
 
04:17:27.590 --> 04:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
their skin
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
to establish
 
04:17:38.640 --> 04:17:40.710 align:start position:0%
to establish
that

04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:43.110 --> 04:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
if a company wants an employee whether
 
04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
it's public or private
 
04:17:48.070 --> 04:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
to undergo testing that involves that
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
that the employee has the right to
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
request an exemption from it
 
04:17:55.110 --> 04:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
and that the employer should grant that
 
04:17:55.120 --> 04:17:57.189 align:start position:0%
and that the employer should grant that
exemption

04:17:57.189 --> 04:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
04:17:57.199 --> 04:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
exemption
um

04:17:59.110 --> 04:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
i did this by
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
amending rsa
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
275 and inserting a new section 275 41e
 
04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on testing exempt
 
04:18:10.399 --> 04:18:11.830 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on testing exempt
status

04:18:11.830 --> 04:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
status
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
and it does four things it defines
 
04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
intrusive testing
 
04:18:19.510 --> 04:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
it establishes that public or private
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
employer in the state
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
that mandates intrusive testing
 
04:18:25.590 --> 04:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
as a condition of new or continued
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
employment shall upon the employee's
 
04:18:30.070 --> 04:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
request for a religious or conscientious
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
objector exemption
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
grant that exemption
 
04:18:35.199 --> 04:18:36.070 align:start position:0%
grant that exemption
and

04:18:36.070 --> 04:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:38.710 --> 04:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
it also establishes that any public
 
04:18:40.389 --> 04:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
private employer in the state that's
 
04:18:45.349 --> 04:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:53.750 --> 04:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
emergency use or experimental product
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
for that testing
 
04:18:57.510 --> 04:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
shell upon the employee's request grant
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
an exception
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
and the second thing that it really does
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
is it directs the employers
 
04:19:06.630 --> 04:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
mandating the testing to establish
 
04:19:09.110 --> 04:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures that ensure no
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
employee is harassed or discriminated
 
04:19:11.040 --> 04:19:12.149 align:start position:0%
employee is harassed or discriminated
against

04:19:12.149 --> 04:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
against
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
due to that employee's testing exemption
 
04:19:14.880 --> 04:19:17.349 align:start position:0%
due to that employee's testing exemption
status

04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
status
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
and basically what it does there is it's
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
basically saying that
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
the companies
 
04:19:27.030 --> 04:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
at least most companies that i have
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
already have existing um
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
policies for that
 
04:19:37.030 --> 04:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
and what this does is basically say that
 
04:19:38.790 --> 04:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
this kind of that kind of harassment
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
won't be tolerated and that it will be
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.229 --> 04:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination and harassment is dealt
 
04:19:52.000 --> 04:19:53.189 align:start position:0%
discrimination and harassment is dealt
with

04:19:53.189 --> 04:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
and so i'd like to ask the committee
 
04:19:59.110 --> 04:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
to support this bill and
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'll take questions
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:20:05.750 --> 04:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative proud
 
04:20:07.269 --> 04:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:20:09.110 --> 04:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative take my question would
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
you see this bill as preventing a
 
04:20:14.070 --> 04:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
employer having a policy of requiring
 
04:20:15.670 --> 04:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
employees to take a breathalyzer at the
 
04:20:25.030 --> 04:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
no i would not actually if if you can uh
 
04:20:31.429 --> 04:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
test the breathalyzer without
 
04:20:33.269 --> 04:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
without being intrusive on it i would
 
04:20:36.149 --> 04:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.149 --> 04:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:20:39.429 --> 04:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm fortunate in life i haven't
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
had much experience with breathalyzers
 
04:20:41.279 --> 04:20:42.550 align:start position:0%
had much experience with breathalyzers
um

04:20:42.550 --> 04:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:44.229 --> 04:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
but from what i understand about them is
 
04:20:45.510 --> 04:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
you normally you have to blow into a
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
straw and therefore you'd have to put
 
04:20:48.950 --> 04:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
that straw in your mouth and looking the
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
definition of intrusive testing
 
04:20:51.680 --> 04:20:52.550 align:start position:0%
definition of intrusive testing
i

04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:20:55.030 --> 04:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
wonder if that would end up on the
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
auspices of this bill or not
 
04:20:59.830 --> 04:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
well the intent of the bill certainly
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't to do that um
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
if you see that as a problem i don't
 
04:21:06.149 --> 04:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
have any problem with amending it so
 
04:21:08.149 --> 04:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
that it would cover a situation like
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
that but
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is actually just
 
04:21:16.870 --> 04:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
to limit the intrusive testing on people
 
04:21:18.149 --> 04:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:21:19.990 --> 04:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any additional questions
 
04:21:22.229 --> 04:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
representative mandeville
 
04:21:24.149 --> 04:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative i i'd just
 
04:21:25.990 --> 04:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
like to follow up on that question with
 
04:21:29.349 --> 04:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
two other examples one being
 
04:21:32.550 --> 04:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
a thermometer maybe put under the tongue
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
or a swab put into the nose like in the
 
04:21:35.520 --> 04:21:37.030 align:start position:0%
or a swab put into the nose like in the
common

04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
common
 
04:21:39.269 --> 04:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
test for covid that is being used now
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
would would either or both of those be
 
04:21:43.750 --> 04:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
viewed as
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
entitled to an exemption per this
 
04:21:46.720 --> 04:21:48.950 align:start position:0%
entitled to an exemption per this
bill

04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
both of those could absolutely be
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
entitled to an exemption under this
 
04:21:53.680 --> 04:21:54.710 align:start position:0%
entitled to an exemption under this
um

04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:57.189 --> 04:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
and in in reality with a thermometer
 
04:21:58.630 --> 04:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
they have thermometers that do not
 
04:22:00.149 --> 04:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
require that you place them under your
 
04:22:00.159 --> 04:22:01.510 align:start position:0%
require that you place them under your
tongue

04:22:01.510 --> 04:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
tongue
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
and as far as
 
04:22:03.680 --> 04:22:06.870 align:start position:0%
and as far as
that

04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
penetration into a nose
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes that would be covered under it
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:19.110 --> 04:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
do you draw any distinction between the
 
04:22:21.910 --> 04:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
deeper and the less deep penetration
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
with the swabs uh in this you said
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
intrusive and i'm just trying to get a
 
04:22:27.030 --> 04:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
if you and i are talking about the same
 
04:22:30.870 --> 04:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
thing as far as intrusive in that
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
respect is
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
no i no the the legislation is written
 
04:22:37.030 --> 04:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
does not draw a distinction between
 
04:22:39.030 --> 04:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
those two thank you thank you robert
 
04:22:39.040 --> 04:22:40.469 align:start position:0%

the so you're talking about blood tests
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
as well if a condition a pre-employment
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
condition is for a blood test that would
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
also be exempted yes thank you thank you
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make sure i heard your your
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
question correctly could you repeat it i
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
know you answered but i didn't quite
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
hear all the questions um
 
04:23:11.349 --> 04:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
if this covered blood tests as a
 
04:23:11.359 --> 04:23:15.030 align:start position:0%
if this covered blood tests as a
pre-employment

04:23:15.030 --> 04:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry your answer representative
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
my answer was yes it would be covered
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
under this
 
04:23:22.710 --> 04:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
so if i might ask a follow-up to that
 
04:23:24.550 --> 04:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative avaloni
 
04:23:26.309 --> 04:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:29.429 --> 04:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
many uh
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
companies that have drivers
 
04:23:33.990 --> 04:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
or have any individuals that work on a
 
04:23:36.550 --> 04:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
job site or in a manufacturer they have
 
04:23:36.560 --> 04:23:37.670 align:start position:0%
job site or in a manufacturer they have
rules

04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
and protocols that if there is an
 
04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
accident whether they get hurt
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
themselves or in a vehicle accident they
 
04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
will be tested for drugs and alcohol and
 
04:23:48.309 --> 04:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
that can be that can be done either as a
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
blood test
 
04:23:51.990 --> 04:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
or such and and
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that that would
 
04:23:56.710 --> 04:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
be caught under under this
 
04:23:59.189 --> 04:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
was that your intent in any way
 
04:24:01.349 --> 04:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
well it would be caught but uh there are
 
04:24:03.750 --> 04:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
alternative ways of testing if someone
 
04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
was to object to the test and this is
 
04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
all based on
 
04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
um someone actually saying uh no i want
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
like i said there are other tests that
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
can be done
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
04:24:25.030 --> 04:24:25.040 align:start position:0%

04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of

relations with the new hampshire
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
hospital association representing all
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
our hospitals we are opposed to 15
 
04:25:21.990 --> 04:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
1358 excuse me
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
we support an employee's right to
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
require vaccinations or periodic
 
04:25:28.630 --> 04:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
screening testing as a condition of
 
04:25:31.030 --> 04:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
employment and
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
chairman chairman i made the same note
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
that you did relative to drug testing
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
because i think this this
 
04:25:40.870 --> 04:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
this bill does contemplate um or would
 
04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
allow for an exemption for drug testing
 
04:25:46.469 --> 04:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
which i think is um is
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
even more concerning
 
04:25:50.550 --> 04:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
there's a process employers require
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
employees to follow if they choose to
 
04:25:54.149 --> 04:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
apply for an exemption and if they are
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
granted an exemption the employee
 
04:25:57.990 --> 04:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
may be required to get tested
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
periodically among other precautions
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
required by the employer this is a
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
decision an employee agrees to make as a
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
condition of continued employment
 
04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
the bill is drafted includes the term
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
conscientious objectior as well as a
 
04:26:14.070 --> 04:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
definition of intrusive testing
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
compelling organizations that choose to
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
require covid19 vaccinations or testing
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
for their employees to permit anyone who
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
objects to the vaccine or testing on the
 
04:26:27.510 --> 04:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
grounds of personal conscience or prior
 
04:26:29.830 --> 04:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
recovery from covid would render any
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine or testing requirement moved
 
04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
putting in patients and staff at greater
 
04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
risk of illness or death we are opposed
 
04:26:39.910 --> 04:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
to 1358 and we urge the committee to
 
04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
find this bill in expedient to legislate
 
04:26:43.830 --> 04:26:43.840 align:start position:0%

i am here today to introduce hb 1377

relative to unemployment benefits
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is being brought about due to
 
04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
a change in employment requirements that
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
were instituted after the employee was
 
04:59:50.000 --> 04:59:51.270 align:start position:0%
were instituted after the employee was
hired

04:59:51.270 --> 04:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
hired
 
04:59:53.910 --> 04:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
we all have reasonable expectations when
 
04:59:55.590 --> 04:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
we go to work for
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
an employer
 
04:59:59.350 --> 04:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
these expectations are spelled out at
 
05:00:00.708 --> 05:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
the time of higher
 
05:00:00.718 --> 05:00:01.910 align:start position:0%
the time of higher
however

05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:00:04.470 --> 05:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
due to government mandates midstream
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
employees are having to make difficult
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
life choices and some are being forced
 
05:00:10.070 --> 05:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
out of their positions for
 
05:00:10.080 --> 05:00:12.150 align:start position:0%
out of their positions for
non-compliance

05:00:12.150 --> 05:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
folks who have worked with the companies
 
05:00:16.550 --> 05:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years are being pushed out
 
05:00:19.030 --> 05:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
and being denied religious and medical
 
05:00:19.040 --> 05:00:21.430 align:start position:0%
and being denied religious and medical
exemptions

05:00:21.430 --> 05:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
05:00:23.510 --> 05:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
doctors are not giving out medical
 
05:00:25.110 --> 05:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
exemptions even if they know it is in
 
05:00:27.270 --> 05:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the patient due to
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
a backlash in the medical community
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
yesterday i heard testimony that a woman
 
05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
who got bell's palsy from a flu shot
 
05:00:37.590 --> 05:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
and has to be careful regarding the
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
ingredients and what is put into her
 
05:00:38.798 --> 05:00:39.670 align:start position:0%
ingredients and what is put into her
body

05:00:39.670 --> 05:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
body
 
05:00:42.310 --> 05:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
has refused a mandated vaccine because
 
05:00:45.270 --> 05:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
she cannot get a list of the ingredients
 
05:00:47.750 --> 05:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
her doctor refused
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
to give her the medical exemption due to
 
05:00:51.430 --> 05:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
the backlash
 
05:00:54.788 --> 05:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
and thus she was forced to leave her job
 
05:00:57.030 --> 05:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
this is only one example but there are
 
05:00:58.550 --> 05:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
many many others
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
encountering this situation
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own folks are
 
05:01:05.590 --> 05:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
losing their jobs and they have no
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
recourse it is up to us at the state
 
05:01:10.628 --> 05:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
level to assist folks with a helping
 
05:01:13.590 --> 05:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
hand until they can get on their feet
 
05:01:15.430 --> 05:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
asking for an additional six months of
 
05:01:17.590 --> 05:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits is not
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
unreasonable in my opinion
 
05:01:21.990 --> 05:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
we are talking about loyal employees who
 
05:01:23.350 --> 05:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
are forced out because they are doing
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
what is best for their health
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
monday night at my county meeting we
 
05:01:30.070 --> 05:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
heard from the new nursing home director
 
05:01:31.590 --> 05:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
that 11 people
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
may lose their job
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
for non-compliance due to the federal
 
05:01:37.990 --> 05:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
mandate on february 15th
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
we also heard that an additional 60 of
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
the staff
 
05:01:44.310 --> 05:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
would lose their job march 15th if they
 
05:01:45.990 --> 05:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
make booster a part of being fully
 
05:01:46.000 --> 05:01:47.350 align:start position:0%
make booster a part of being fully
vaccinated

05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
05:01:50.070 --> 05:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
what are these folks to do
 
05:01:51.510 --> 05:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
i also heard
 
05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
that the vendors
 
05:01:55.110 --> 05:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
employees are being turned away and
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
those that do serve the nursing home can
 
05:02:00.070 --> 05:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
now charge higher prices
 
05:02:01.990 --> 05:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
on a personal note
 
05:02:04.150 --> 05:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
a close family member passed away within
 
05:02:06.550 --> 05:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
40 hours 48 hours after receiving her
 
05:02:08.150 --> 05:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
second vaccine
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
the daughter who is a kind caring person
 
05:02:12.310 --> 05:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
anguished for months over whether to
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
take the vaccine so she continued to
 
05:02:15.830 --> 05:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
help others
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
and in the end she took the vaccine
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
but the psychological toll it took on
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
her was unnerving
 
05:02:24.070 --> 05:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
had she opted not to take the vaccine
 
05:02:26.708 --> 05:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
she would have no income i'm open to
 
05:02:26.718 --> 05:02:28.948 align:start position:0%
she would have no income i'm open to
questions

05:02:28.948 --> 05:02:28.958 align:start position:0%

taking the question um you put this

under 275
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
would this be better under 282 for
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and i
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%

you thank you
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:00.070 --> 05:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan represented
 
05:03:02.708 --> 05:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
followed by representative mandeville
 
05:03:04.470 --> 05:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
i understand the desire to have someone
 
05:03:12.868 --> 05:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
get unemployment benefits and if if you
 
05:03:15.510 --> 05:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
um voluntarily resign
 
05:03:17.430 --> 05:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
not really voluntarily it could be
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
argued that someone who refuses to take
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
a vaccination has voluntarily desi
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
resigned because they could have
 
05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
kept their job if they got the vaccine i
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
understand your point in letting them
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
get the workers comp
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
what i'm curious about is why they would
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
get an additional six months
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
beyond what
 
05:03:39.350 --> 05:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else is unemployed would get
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
05:03:40.878 --> 05:03:42.550 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
representative

05:03:42.550 --> 05:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh first off this has nothing to do with
 
05:03:46.230 --> 05:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
workers comp this is strictly
 
05:03:46.240 --> 05:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
workers comp this is strictly
unemployment

05:03:47.990 --> 05:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry and the other thing is
 
05:03:51.270 --> 05:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
is that there was a contractual
 
05:03:51.280 --> 05:03:52.628 align:start position:0%
is that there was a contractual
agreement

05:03:52.628 --> 05:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
between an employer an employee when
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
they started working there and nowhere
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
in that did it say that they had to take
 
05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
a mandated vaccine
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
so they have changed their practices
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
midstream and i think it is unfair for
 
05:04:05.600 --> 05:04:06.708 align:start position:0%
midstream and i think it is unfair for
employ

05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
employ
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
employer employees who have worked for a
 
05:04:11.190 --> 05:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
company and been loyal to them
 
05:04:12.868 --> 05:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
to be out on the street because they are
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
doing what is best for their health and
 
05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
their family and
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
not only that is it's the psychological
 
05:04:20.150 --> 05:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
damage and the toll it takes on these
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
folks too so an additional six months i
 
05:04:27.910 --> 05:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:29.430 --> 05:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
what was it manifold
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
05:04:30.718 --> 05:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
following up on representative
 
05:04:36.390 --> 05:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
sullivan's question i wonder if
 
05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
you would have any concern
 
05:04:38.400 --> 05:04:40.390 align:start position:0%
you would have any concern
that

05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
enacting this bill
 
05:04:42.958 --> 05:04:43.910 align:start position:0%
enacting this bill
would

05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:04:43.920 --> 05:04:45.110 align:start position:0%
would
create

05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
create
 
05:04:45.120 --> 05:04:46.390 align:start position:0%
create
problems

05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
problems
 
05:04:46.400 --> 05:04:48.230 align:start position:0%
problems
keeping

05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
keeping
 
05:04:48.240 --> 05:04:49.270 align:start position:0%
keeping
staff

05:04:49.270 --> 05:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
staff
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
in places especially
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
such as nursing homes or health
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
facilities which are struggling with
 
05:04:57.590 --> 05:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
staffing anyway
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
but other places as well
 
05:04:59.760 --> 05:05:00.788 align:start position:0%
but other places as well
where

05:05:00.788 --> 05:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
there would be this opportunity created
 
05:05:06.310 --> 05:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
to get a kind of a windfall of sorts an
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
extra six months by simply saying i'm
 
05:05:10.320 --> 05:05:11.910 align:start position:0%
extra six months by simply saying i'm
not

05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:05:13.830 --> 05:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
being vaccinated even if they might
 
05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise want to or been vaccinated
 
05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
05:05:20.868 --> 05:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative and i'll go back to when
 
05:05:23.110 --> 05:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
we gave unemployment to anybody that
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
just claimed that they were afraid to go
 
05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
to work for covet and then an additional
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
six hundred dollars per month which put
 
05:05:30.788 --> 05:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
a hardship on businesses
 
05:05:32.788 --> 05:05:32.798 align:start position:0%
however collecting unemployment benefits
 
05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
is not a substitute for your at regular
 
05:05:36.788 --> 05:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
check it is only a portion of that and
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
is only to help
 
05:05:46.310 --> 05:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:46.320 --> 05:05:48.628 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:05:48.628 --> 05:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
05:05:51.910 --> 05:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
05:05:55.030 --> 05:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
would this bill change at all um who is
 
05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
eligible for unemployment upon
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
termination uh for
 
05:06:00.628 --> 05:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
not receiving a
 
05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirement because i
 
05:06:03.430 --> 05:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
believe we've previously heard testimony
 
05:06:03.440 --> 05:06:04.310 align:start position:0%
believe we've previously heard testimony
that

05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:06:04.320 --> 05:06:06.070 align:start position:0%
that
the

05:06:06.070 --> 05:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
department of labor only
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
considers it if it wasn't directly job
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
related so they said health care workers
 
05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be eligible
 
05:06:14.470 --> 05:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
but most other workers were would this
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
change that at all
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:06:18.958 --> 05:06:19.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
so

05:06:19.910 --> 05:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:06:22.788 --> 05:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
i'll just relate a personal experience
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
i had the opportunity to go work for a
 
05:06:26.070 --> 05:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
hospital at one point but they told me
 
05:06:27.430 --> 05:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
that i would have to receive the flu
 
05:06:30.070 --> 05:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
shot every year which i opted out of
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
so i did not take that job so
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
people collecting
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
most businesses do not require you to
 
05:06:42.788 --> 05:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
take a mandated flu shot or any other
 
05:06:42.798 --> 05:06:44.070 align:start position:0%
take a mandated flu shot or any other
vaccine

05:06:44.070 --> 05:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:06:46.788 --> 05:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
to work at their place of employment
 
05:06:46.798 --> 05:06:47.750 align:start position:0%
to work at their place of employment
and

05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:06:49.590 --> 05:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
under this because they're such
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
controversial and it was an emergency
 
05:06:54.390 --> 05:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
and experimental
 
05:06:54.400 --> 05:06:55.590 align:start position:0%
and experimental
vaccine

05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
i i think it calls into question
 
05:06:57.680 --> 05:06:58.788 align:start position:0%
i i think it calls into question
especially

05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
especially
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
in the fact that you cannot even get a
 
05:07:02.550 --> 05:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
list of ingredients folks do not even
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
know if they're allergic to anything
 
05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing a lot of side effects
 
05:07:09.670 --> 05:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
due to this and i think people need to
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
be able to look out for their health
 
05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
because without your health nothing else
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
really matters
 
05:07:17.110 --> 05:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:18.628 --> 05:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for the
 
05:07:18.638 --> 05:07:20.868 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for the
representative

vaccine policy i'll hand that out

05:08:35.670 --> 05:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chairman um so
 
05:08:41.350 --> 05:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
first and foremost the department
 
05:08:44.788 --> 05:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
as we customarily do with policy matters
 
05:08:46.628 --> 05:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
that come before this committee the
 
05:08:49.110 --> 05:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
department is neutral with regard to the
 
05:08:52.948 --> 05:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
bill that we're currently considering
 
05:08:54.628 --> 05:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
i do
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
need to note that the

05:09:03.510 --> 05:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:09:05.190 --> 05:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
that they did take a position in
 
05:09:05.200 --> 05:09:06.390 align:start position:0%
that they did take a position in
opposition

05:09:06.390 --> 05:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
05:09:09.030 --> 05:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
to this bill when they met this past
 
05:09:09.040 --> 05:09:10.150 align:start position:0%
to this bill when they met this past
monday

05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
monday
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
that was a four to nothing
 
05:09:12.718 --> 05:09:14.070 align:start position:0%
that was a four to nothing
vote

05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:09:17.190 --> 05:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine is a member of that
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
committee that counsel
 
05:09:20.310 --> 05:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the house of
 
05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
representatives he did abstain from that
 
05:09:22.480 --> 05:09:23.270 align:start position:0%
representatives he did abstain from that
but

05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:09:25.910 --> 05:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
the chair of that committee lee nyquist
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
did ask that i make sure that the
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee was aware that they had taken
 
05:09:32.230 --> 05:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
a position in opposition to this bill
 
05:09:33.270 --> 05:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
but again
 
05:09:35.910 --> 05:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
the council is separate and distinct
 
05:09:37.830 --> 05:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
from the department the department is
 
05:09:37.840 --> 05:09:39.990 align:start position:0%
from the department the department is
neutral

05:09:39.990 --> 05:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
05:09:42.310 --> 05:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
as we do with all
 
05:09:44.070 --> 05:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
matters that
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
potentially impact the unemployment
 
05:09:48.390 --> 05:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
program in the state the department has
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
submitted this bill to the u.s
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
department of labor
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
and has requested that they review
 
05:09:58.788 --> 05:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
the proposal for purposes of compliance
 
05:10:01.590 --> 05:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
and conformity with federal requirements
 
05:10:04.230 --> 05:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
members of this committee
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
can remember
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
some prior legislation that we've gone
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
through that same
 
05:10:11.270 --> 05:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
process on
 
05:10:13.110 --> 05:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have a response yet from the
 
05:10:15.270 --> 05:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
u.s department of labor certainly as
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
soon as we do have that response we'll
 
05:10:19.030 --> 05:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
make that available
 
05:10:20.868 --> 05:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
to chairman infantine
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee so you can
 
05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
review that and ask any associated
 
05:10:25.360 --> 05:10:27.510 align:start position:0%
review that and ask any associated
questions

05:10:27.510 --> 05:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:10:30.550 --> 05:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
based upon some recent opinions that we
 
05:10:32.550 --> 05:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
have gotten back from u.s department of
 
05:10:32.560 --> 05:10:33.590 align:start position:0%
have gotten back from u.s department of
labor

05:10:33.590 --> 05:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
labor
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
on some recent matters that this
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
committee has dealt with
 
05:10:40.230 --> 05:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
i do suspect
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
that they may take issue
 
05:10:44.948 --> 05:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
with some of the provisions
 
05:10:47.670 --> 05:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
in this bill particularly
 
05:10:50.230 --> 05:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
with the proposal to provide an
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
additional six months
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
of unemployment benefits uh to a
 
05:10:57.430 --> 05:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
screw up the microphone as i adjusted
 
05:10:57.440 --> 05:10:58.868 align:start position:0%
screw up the microphone as i adjusted
here

05:10:58.868 --> 05:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:11:01.350 --> 05:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
but with their the proposal to provide
 
05:11:03.470 --> 05:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
an additional six months of benefits to
 
05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
a particular group
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
of people claiming unemployment
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
what we have seen
 
05:11:15.708 --> 05:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
most recently i believe we were in the
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
2019 time period
 
05:11:20.788 --> 05:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
might have been 2018
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan you remember uh
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
quite clearly when we were dealing with
 
05:11:26.470 --> 05:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
the bus driver issue
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
and there was a proposal that came
 
05:11:30.628 --> 05:11:30.638 align:start position:0%
before this committee
 
05:11:33.910 --> 05:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
to ease the work search requirements
 
05:11:35.510 --> 05:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
for bus drivers
 
05:11:37.270 --> 05:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
um it was a way they felt that it would
 
05:11:40.708 --> 05:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
help retain more of their workforce
 
05:11:42.150 --> 05:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
back then as they do now they were
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
struggling to have enough drivers
 
05:11:46.628 --> 05:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
so that bill would have eased work
 
05:11:48.708 --> 05:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
search requirements but only for one
 
05:11:50.310 --> 05:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
particular group
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
um us department of labor got back to
 
05:11:55.110 --> 05:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
the state and said
 
05:11:55.120 --> 05:11:55.990 align:start position:0%
the state and said
that

05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:58.628 --> 05:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
treating one group differently than the
 
05:11:58.638 --> 05:12:00.150 align:start position:0%
treating one group differently than the
others

05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
others
 
05:12:02.070 --> 05:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
for purposes of a requirement for
 
05:12:02.080 --> 05:12:03.990 align:start position:0%
for purposes of a requirement for
eligibility

05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
05:12:05.990 --> 05:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
ran counter to their equal treatment
 
05:12:06.000 --> 05:12:07.190 align:start position:0%
ran counter to their equal treatment
provision

05:12:07.190 --> 05:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
provision
 
05:12:08.868 --> 05:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
now they didn't tell the state that you
 
05:12:10.708 --> 05:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't do this that's not how they
 
05:12:10.718 --> 05:12:11.910 align:start position:0%
couldn't do this that's not how they
operate

05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
operate
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
with us what they did was they told us
 
05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
that it would if enacted it would have
 
05:12:18.708 --> 05:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
caused new hampshire to be out of
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
compliance and conformity with federal
 
05:12:20.718 --> 05:12:22.310 align:start position:0%
compliance and conformity with federal
requirements

05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:12:24.550 --> 05:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
what that means is that if we're found
 
05:12:26.470 --> 05:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
out of compliance we lose our
 
05:12:27.750 --> 05:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
administrative funding for the
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment program uh that's about 30
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
and if we're out of conformity that
 
05:12:36.310 --> 05:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
means that employers in the state no
 
05:12:39.030 --> 05:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
longer get to take their 90 tax credit
 
05:12:41.270 --> 05:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
against their federal tax obligation for
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax purposes that's about a
 
05:12:45.830 --> 05:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
200 million a year
 
05:12:48.150 --> 05:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
hit for new hampshire business so at the
 
05:12:50.788 --> 05:12:50.798 align:start position:0%
time they came back and said if you
 
05:12:53.430 --> 05:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
treat these workers differently than
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
others for purposes of eligibility
 
05:12:59.110 --> 05:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
that would cause a conformity issue
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature in response to that
 
05:13:04.310 --> 05:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure other
 
05:13:06.550 --> 05:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
matters that they were considering
 
05:13:08.310 --> 05:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
changed that bill
 
05:13:10.868 --> 05:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
and made it so that anybody
 
05:13:14.070 --> 05:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
on a temporary layoff of a defined
 
05:13:14.080 --> 05:13:15.270 align:start position:0%
on a temporary layoff of a defined
duration

05:13:15.270 --> 05:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
duration
 
05:13:16.550 --> 05:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
originally they were looking at nine
 
05:13:18.550 --> 05:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
weeks ultimately they ended up at 11
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
weeks but anyone on a temporary layoff
 
05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
with a with a certain return date to
 
05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
that employer
 
05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
would then be
 
05:13:30.868 --> 05:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
would not have to deal with work search
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
requirements as a as a
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
matter of continued eligibility
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
department of labor u.s department of
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
labor was fine with that we weren't
 
05:13:39.200 --> 05:13:40.150 align:start position:0%
labor was fine with that we weren't
treating

05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
treating
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
the bus drivers or anyone else any
 
05:13:43.110 --> 05:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
differently it was everyone that found
 
05:13:45.030 --> 05:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
themselves in that situation
 
05:13:47.190 --> 05:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
so i bring that up just to point out
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
that with the proposed uh bill here
 
05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
that with proposing to provide an
 
05:13:55.510 --> 05:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
additional six months of benefits to
 
05:13:55.520 --> 05:13:56.550 align:start position:0%
additional six months of benefits to
certain

05:13:56.550 --> 05:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
certain
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
individuals based on their type of
 
05:14:01.030 --> 05:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
separation from employment that could be
 
05:14:04.230 --> 05:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
a cause of concern but again i'm not the
 
05:14:06.628 --> 05:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
u.s department of labor i just wanted to
 
05:14:08.788 --> 05:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
bring that to your attention when we do
 
05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
get that opinion back from them we'll
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
certainly make that
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:24.788 --> 05:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
looking at our
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
current policy that we have
 
05:14:28.628 --> 05:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
05:14:31.270 --> 05:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility for unemployment benefits
 
05:14:32.708 --> 05:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
in situations
 
05:14:34.868 --> 05:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
like this where we have an employer that
 
05:14:37.430 --> 05:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
has a requirement for vaccination
 
05:14:38.788 --> 05:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
i can give you some numbers on what
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
05:14:42.310 --> 05:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
since about september
 
05:14:44.070 --> 05:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about
 
05:14:46.470 --> 05:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
the origins of that policy
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
and then certainly answer questions
 
05:14:48.958 --> 05:14:49.830 align:start position:0%
and then certainly answer questions
so

05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:49.840 --> 05:14:51.030 align:start position:0%
so

05:14:51.030 --> 05:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:14:51.040 --> 05:14:52.948 align:start position:0%
since
our

05:14:52.948 --> 05:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:14:52.958 --> 05:14:54.310 align:start position:0%
our

05:14:54.310 --> 05:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
materials
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
were first published back in
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
on our website back in september
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
the materials that you have in front of
 
05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
you with the the frequently asked
 
05:15:03.440 --> 05:15:04.628 align:start position:0%
you with the the frequently asked
questions

05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
those were posted to our website we've
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
had about 134
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
claims for unemployment benefits
 
05:15:12.080 --> 05:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
claims for unemployment benefits
so

05:15:13.350 --> 05:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:15.430 --> 05:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
situations where someone has filed for
 
05:15:15.440 --> 05:15:16.550 align:start position:0%
situations where someone has filed for
unemployment

05:15:16.550 --> 05:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the reason that they are no longer
 
05:15:18.480 --> 05:15:19.510 align:start position:0%
and the reason that they are no longer
working

05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
working
 
05:15:22.470 --> 05:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
is related to a vaccine requirement from
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
now that is not the full universe of
 
05:15:27.430 --> 05:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
people that have left employment in new
 
05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire i am sure
 
05:15:31.750 --> 05:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
but it is the universe of people that
 
05:15:34.310 --> 05:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
have left employment and have filed for
 
05:15:38.470 --> 05:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits so 134 individuals
 
05:15:42.390 --> 05:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
to date 70 7-0 of those claims have been
 
05:15:45.750 --> 05:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
denied 30 percent have been allowed
 
05:15:48.628 --> 05:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
when we look within particular sectors
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
the health care sector has been the the
 
05:15:50.638 --> 05:15:51.670 align:start position:0%
the health care sector has been the the
dominant

05:15:51.670 --> 05:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
dominant
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh sector from which people have
 
05:15:57.030 --> 05:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
separated and filed for unemployment
 
05:16:01.750 --> 05:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
we've had 92 of those 134 claims have
 
05:16:04.550 --> 05:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
been within health care employers
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
and of those 92 claims from individuals
 
05:16:10.390 --> 05:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
last employed by a health care employer
 
05:16:12.708 --> 05:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
that's hospitals but also ambulatory
 
05:16:15.910 --> 05:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
health other medical type employers
 
05:16:17.830 --> 05:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
we've had 90
 
05:16:20.390 --> 05:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
of those have been denied
 
05:16:25.590 --> 05:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
so again total 134 claims filed thus far
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
for people that have left for those
 
05:16:29.350 --> 05:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
types of reasons and have filed for
 
05:16:29.360 --> 05:16:30.550 align:start position:0%
types of reasons and have filed for
unemployment

05:16:30.550 --> 05:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
05:16:33.030 --> 05:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh 70 denied
 
05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
of that 92 have been within health care
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
and those health care claims 90
 
05:16:41.510 --> 05:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
of those have been denied so
 
05:16:43.270 --> 05:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
getting into the
 
05:16:46.070 --> 05:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
approach that the department takes
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
to these types of situations
 
05:16:52.708 --> 05:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
first and foremost we very much respect
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
the at will nature private sector
 
05:16:56.788 --> 05:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
employment here in the state
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
so when we implement a policy in looking
 
05:16:59.520 --> 05:17:00.390 align:start position:0%
so when we implement a policy in looking
at

05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
a claim for unemployment benefits where
 
05:17:04.708 --> 05:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
someone has
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
violated an employer policy we're not
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
telling the employer that they can't
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
have that policy
 
05:17:13.590 --> 05:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
we are simply looking at it and looking
 
05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire supreme court case law
 
05:17:18.628 --> 05:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
most specifically the sweepstakes
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
decision issued back in 1988 in the
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
progeny of cases that have come from
 
05:17:27.270 --> 05:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
that decision and looking to see whether
 
05:17:29.910 --> 05:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
or not the employer's policy is
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable under the circumstances
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
so again not telling the employer they
 
05:17:37.750 --> 05:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
can't have that policy but what we are
 
05:17:39.590 --> 05:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
doing is looking at it to see whether or
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
not the individual qualifies for
 
05:17:44.070 --> 05:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits and whether that
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
policy is reasonable under the
 
05:17:46.400 --> 05:17:47.830 align:start position:0%
policy is reasonable under the
circumstances

05:17:47.830 --> 05:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
05:17:50.550 --> 05:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
so reasonableness is really a function
 
05:17:52.550 --> 05:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the context in which
 
05:17:55.110 --> 05:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
the policy is applied
 
05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
context here is going to be the sector
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
in which that policy is being applied so
 
05:18:00.958 --> 05:18:01.750 align:start position:0%
in which that policy is being applied so
with

05:18:01.750 --> 05:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:18:03.510 --> 05:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
specifically with a vaccination
 
05:18:03.520 --> 05:18:05.670 align:start position:0%
specifically with a vaccination
requirement

05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:18:07.350 --> 05:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about a health care
 
05:18:07.360 --> 05:18:09.350 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about a health care
employer

05:18:09.350 --> 05:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
employer
 
05:18:13.350 --> 05:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
charged with providing care to
 
05:18:16.390 --> 05:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
our most frail and vulnerable citizens
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
health care employers are
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
considered to be acting reasonably with
 
05:18:25.670 --> 05:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
a strict vaccination requirement because
 
05:18:28.150 --> 05:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
of the circumstances under which they
 
05:18:30.070 --> 05:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
find themselves in the services that
 
05:18:31.430 --> 05:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
they provide
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
largely provided care to a vulnerable
 
05:18:36.868 --> 05:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
population so a health care employer
 
05:18:38.948 --> 05:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
with that interpretation would be
 
05:18:42.150 --> 05:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to have a strict requirement
 
05:18:44.550 --> 05:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
require vaccination of
 
05:18:47.830 --> 05:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
its employees they need to consider
 
05:18:50.230 --> 05:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
medical and religious grounds for
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
exception to that policy
 
05:18:55.110 --> 05:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
but if someone
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
refused to comply
 
05:18:58.628 --> 05:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
did not
 
05:18:58.638 --> 05:18:59.910 align:start position:0%
did not
meet

05:18:59.910 --> 05:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
meet
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
the grounds for a medical or religious
 
05:19:04.628 --> 05:19:04.638 align:start position:0%
exemption to that policy they would not
 
05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
be eligible for unemployment benefits in
 
05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
that healthcare context
 
05:19:11.990 --> 05:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
now moving outside of healthcare
 
05:19:12.000 --> 05:19:12.830 align:start position:0%
now moving outside of healthcare
in

05:19:12.830 --> 05:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
hospitality in retail
 
05:19:17.750 --> 05:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
office environments
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
where we're not dealing with an employer
 
05:19:22.708 --> 05:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
that's providing care
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
to a frail and vulnerable population
 
05:19:29.830 --> 05:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
employers that are outside of healthcare
 
05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
if they were to implement a strict
 
05:19:31.680 --> 05:19:32.708 align:start position:0%
if they were to implement a strict
policy

05:19:32.708 --> 05:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:19:32.718 --> 05:19:33.750 align:start position:0%
policy
only

05:19:33.750 --> 05:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:19:36.948 --> 05:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
where they required vaccination did not
 
05:19:39.030 --> 05:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
allow any alternatives alternatives
 
05:19:39.040 --> 05:19:39.830 align:start position:0%
allow any alternatives alternatives
being

05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
an employee agreeing to testing and
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
masking protocol
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
that they required vaccination and we're
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
outside of health care that individual
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
that separates from that employer
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
is likely to be eligible for
 
05:19:56.550 --> 05:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
05:19:56.560 --> 05:19:57.350 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
now

05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:05.030 --> 05:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
has a flexible policy where they require
 
05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
vaccination but
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
those employees that choose not to be
 
05:20:11.670 --> 05:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinated they allow them
 
05:20:14.310 --> 05:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
to comply with testing
 
05:20:14.320 --> 05:20:15.270 align:start position:0%
to comply with testing
and

05:20:15.270 --> 05:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:17.750 --> 05:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
masking alternatives to that vaccination
 
05:20:17.760 --> 05:20:19.030 align:start position:0%
masking alternatives to that vaccination
requirement

05:20:19.030 --> 05:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
and someone still
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
quits that employment or is fired for
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
refusing to comply with that flexible
 
05:20:25.760 --> 05:20:26.868 align:start position:0%
refusing to comply with that flexible
policy

05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:20:30.310 --> 05:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
they would likely not be eligible for
 
05:20:32.150 --> 05:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
05:20:35.430 --> 05:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
but again employer needs to consider
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
any medical or religious grounds for
 
05:20:41.750 --> 05:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
that employee not being able to comply
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
medical grounds for being unable to
 
05:20:49.270 --> 05:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
comply with a vaccine policy requirement
 
05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
we look towards the medical community
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
for that individuals provide us with
 
05:20:55.830 --> 05:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
medical documentation
 
05:20:57.830 --> 05:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
from their provider
 
05:21:00.310 --> 05:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's largely what we look at for
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not the
 
05:21:04.390 --> 05:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
individual has met that medical
 
05:21:06.230 --> 05:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
exception to that policy and whether
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
they are eligible for unemployment not
 
05:21:10.548 --> 05:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
that they have to be rehired by the
 
05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
employer mind you but whether they're
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
eligible for unemployment right
 
05:21:17.510 --> 05:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to religious grounds we
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
look to make sure that the employer has
 
05:21:19.440 --> 05:21:20.788 align:start position:0%
look to make sure that the employer has
considered

05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
considered
 
05:21:23.430 --> 05:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
a request for a religious exception
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
from that individual
 
05:21:29.350 --> 05:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
and then as long as the employer has
 
05:21:30.628 --> 05:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
considered it
 
05:21:33.910 --> 05:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
it was timely raised by the individual
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
then we defer to the employer's decision
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
with regard to that request for a
 
05:21:42.470 --> 05:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
religious exception
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of variation
 
05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
within a very small universe of claims
 
05:21:50.548 --> 05:21:50.558 align:start position:0%
with 134 claims thus far
 
05:21:52.868 --> 05:21:52.878 align:start position:0%
but that is largely an overview of how
 
05:21:55.510 --> 05:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
we approach it based upon
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
at will nature of private sector
 
05:21:59.190 --> 05:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
employment in the state
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
and based upon the decisions issued by
 
05:22:04.788 --> 05:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court going
 
05:22:06.948 --> 05:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
back to our sweepstakes decision which
 
05:22:08.788 --> 05:22:08.798 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
05:22:10.948 --> 05:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
the ability of an employer to enact a
 
05:22:13.350 --> 05:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
policy and whether or not individuals
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
who are unable to comply or violate that
 
05:22:17.350 --> 05:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to be eligible for
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
05:22:21.030 --> 05:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that's how we've approached these
 
05:22:23.190 --> 05:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
cases and the document that was
 
05:22:25.830 --> 05:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
circulated i hope there was enough for
 
05:22:27.830 --> 05:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee but that
 
05:22:29.350 --> 05:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
provides some
 
05:22:30.788 --> 05:22:30.798 align:start position:0%
some frequently asked questions some
 
05:22:32.628 --> 05:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
common scenarios that we try to hope to
 
05:22:35.750 --> 05:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
illustrate the approach that we've taken
 
05:22:38.390 --> 05:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
so i'll stop with that and i can
 
05:22:38.400 --> 05:22:39.510 align:start position:0%
so i'll stop with that and i can
certainly

05:22:39.510 --> 05:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:22:41.350 --> 05:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
05:22:44.788 --> 05:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:45.750 --> 05:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh just for sure you're aware mr deputy
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner i did provide the committee
 
05:22:54.070 --> 05:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
with the powerpoint presentation you
 
05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee outlining the
 
05:22:58.868 --> 05:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
number of claims and etcetera so they
 
05:23:01.110 --> 05:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
are a little familiar with that i did
 
05:23:02.788 --> 05:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
see a few hands representative seaworth
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:08.310 --> 05:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:23:08.320 --> 05:23:09.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
your

05:23:09.190 --> 05:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:23:09.200 --> 05:23:10.548 align:start position:0%
your
testimony

05:23:10.548 --> 05:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
something i'm and maybe you can clarify
 
05:23:16.150 --> 05:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
if it's too big a question maybe we can
 
05:23:19.510 --> 05:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
take it offline but where i'm getting
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
a little confused in the gray area so
 
05:23:26.070 --> 05:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm an employer i'm unhappy with
 
05:23:26.080 --> 05:23:26.948 align:start position:0%
i'm an employer i'm unhappy with
my

05:23:26.948 --> 05:23:26.958 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:23:26.958 --> 05:23:28.628 align:start position:0%
my
employee's

05:23:28.628 --> 05:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
employee's
 
05:23:31.270 --> 05:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
work product and i say i can't employ
 
05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
you anymore
 
05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i fire him it would seem he's almost
 
05:23:38.310 --> 05:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
certainly eligible for unemployment
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
under such a circumstance on the other
 
05:23:40.878 --> 05:23:41.910 align:start position:0%
under such a circumstance on the other
hand

05:23:41.910 --> 05:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
hand
 
05:23:43.910 --> 05:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
and trying to generalize from this
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine if i say
 
05:23:49.990 --> 05:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
my employee is not complying
 
05:23:50.000 --> 05:23:50.788 align:start position:0%
my employee is not complying
with

05:23:50.788 --> 05:23:50.798 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:23:53.350 --> 05:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
what i've laid out as the requirements
 
05:23:55.270 --> 05:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
for employment here
 
05:23:58.070 --> 05:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
then it goes into this test are are my
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
requests reasonable and he may or may
 
05:24:02.708 --> 05:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
not be able to
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
be eligible for unemployment and it
 
05:24:06.788 --> 05:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
seems to me there's there's some gray
 
05:24:08.708 --> 05:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
area in between there where what's the
 
05:24:10.390 --> 05:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
05:24:13.030 --> 05:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
poor performance and not meeting my
 
05:24:16.868 --> 05:24:16.878 align:start position:0%
requirements of the employee can you
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
maybe in a little easier way than my
 
05:24:21.350 --> 05:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
question was phrase kind of explain
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
the difference between those two
 
05:24:25.510 --> 05:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances and just for clarification
 
05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
i know that representative turcotte
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
would be a stellar employee so
 
05:24:32.070 --> 05:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
i know that you aren't referring to his
 
05:24:34.230 --> 05:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
work performance
 
05:24:37.350 --> 05:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
so when we get into your ability to do
 
05:24:38.470 --> 05:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
the job
 
05:24:40.868 --> 05:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
right the your ability to do the job and
 
05:24:43.430 --> 05:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
if you're fired for being unable to do
 
05:24:44.868 --> 05:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
the work
 
05:24:48.070 --> 05:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
you are in almost all cases going to be
 
05:24:50.310 --> 05:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
eligible for unemployment benefits
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
really you're
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
you unfortunately maybe got hired into a
 
05:24:56.310 --> 05:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
position for which you
 
05:24:58.788 --> 05:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
just you overshot
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
and then couldn't do the work
 
05:25:02.830 --> 05:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
we do not
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
um or rather when when it comes to
 
05:25:06.480 --> 05:25:08.070 align:start position:0%
um or rather when when it comes to
ability

05:25:08.070 --> 05:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
ability
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
and your lack thereof you're going to be
 
05:25:10.320 --> 05:25:12.310 align:start position:0%
and your lack thereof you're going to be
eligible

05:25:12.310 --> 05:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
05:25:16.708 --> 05:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
compliance with an employer policy
 
05:25:19.270 --> 05:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
is a different circumstance
 
05:25:20.948 --> 05:25:20.958 align:start position:0%
under which you would find yourself
 
05:25:23.110 --> 05:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
potentially unemployed
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
and when we when we look again at
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
employer policies vaccination is a
 
05:25:30.948 --> 05:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
employer policy in this case
 
05:25:32.788 --> 05:25:32.798 align:start position:0%
we look to see
 
05:25:36.310 --> 05:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
the reasons why an employer has either a
 
05:25:39.270 --> 05:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
strict or a flexible policy
 
05:25:42.150 --> 05:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to a vaccination requirement
 
05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
and then again we look to see the
 
05:25:46.230 --> 05:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
context in which that employer is
 
05:25:46.240 --> 05:25:47.830 align:start position:0%
context in which that employer is
operating

05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
operating
 
05:25:50.070 --> 05:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
there could be a scenario where a
 
05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
non-healthcare employer
 
05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
might be dealing with a vulnerable
 
05:25:55.360 --> 05:25:57.110 align:start position:0%
might be dealing with a vulnerable
clientele

05:25:57.110 --> 05:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
clientele
 
05:25:59.190 --> 05:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
they might decide to have a strict
 
05:26:01.270 --> 05:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirement but they're
 
05:26:03.110 --> 05:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
outside of the health care
 
05:26:03.120 --> 05:26:04.230 align:start position:0%
outside of the health care
sector

05:26:04.230 --> 05:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
sector
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
and they might be able to justify
 
05:26:08.708 --> 05:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
the strict requirement
 
05:26:10.708 --> 05:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
and then someone that does not comply
 
05:26:11.750 --> 05:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:26:13.510 --> 05:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
might find themselves ineligible for
 
05:26:13.520 --> 05:26:14.868 align:start position:0%
might find themselves ineligible for
unemployment

05:26:14.868 --> 05:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
05:26:17.510 --> 05:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
in each and every one of these cases and
 
05:26:19.990 --> 05:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'll just stress that again in each and
 
05:26:22.708 --> 05:26:22.718 align:start position:0%
every single one of these unemployment
 
05:26:22.718 --> 05:26:23.830 align:start position:0%
every single one of these unemployment
cases

05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with a vaccination requirement
 
05:26:30.390 --> 05:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
as we do with all separation decisions
 
05:26:32.470 --> 05:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
we talk with the individual filing for
 
05:26:32.480 --> 05:26:33.670 align:start position:0%
we talk with the individual filing for
unemployment

05:26:33.670 --> 05:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
05:26:36.548 --> 05:26:36.558 align:start position:0%
and we talk with the employer
 
05:26:39.190 --> 05:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
so we go through a fact-finding process
 
05:26:41.430 --> 05:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
we get as much information relevant to
 
05:26:43.910 --> 05:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
that separation as we can get from both
 
05:26:46.310 --> 05:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
of them oftentimes it involves us going
 
05:26:47.590 --> 05:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
05:26:49.830 --> 05:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
to each of them to ask additional
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions and based upon the information
 
05:26:54.548 --> 05:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
that we get from both sides then
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
applying that within the context of the
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
four corners of our policy we determine
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not that individual is
 
05:27:01.280 --> 05:27:02.548 align:start position:0%
whether or not that individual is
eligible

05:27:02.548 --> 05:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
05:27:04.948 --> 05:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
all of these claims
 
05:27:06.628 --> 05:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
are then
 
05:27:08.230 --> 05:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
with the attention that the department
 
05:27:10.390 --> 05:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
provides to this area we meet regularly
 
05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
on a weekly basis we're reviewing claims
 
05:27:14.628 --> 05:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
that are coming in
 
05:27:17.430 --> 05:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the the circumstances
 
05:27:19.670 --> 05:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
under which these claims are being filed
 
05:27:21.510 --> 05:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
and we're making sure that the decisions
 
05:27:23.190 --> 05:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
are being issued consistent with the
 
05:27:26.070 --> 05:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
policy but each and every case each side
 
05:27:27.590 --> 05:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity
 
05:27:31.670 --> 05:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:32.948 --> 05:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
president of sullivan followed by
 
05:27:34.868 --> 05:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
abalone and
 
05:27:37.110 --> 05:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
then cahill thank you mr
 
05:27:37.120 --> 05:27:38.390 align:start position:0%
then cahill thank you mr
chairman

05:27:38.390 --> 05:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
and thank you rich for taking
 
05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
mr uh
 
05:27:42.080 --> 05:27:42.948 align:start position:0%
mr uh
uh

05:27:42.948 --> 05:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:46.948 --> 05:27:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:49.350 --> 05:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
you explained in detail what the
 
05:27:52.788 --> 05:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
six-month issue um might
 
05:27:55.990 --> 05:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
entail with the u.s department of labor
 
05:27:57.830 --> 05:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
but as i read this
 
05:27:57.840 --> 05:27:58.628 align:start position:0%
but as i read this
this

05:27:58.628 --> 05:27:58.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
bill does not appear to make someone
 
05:28:03.350 --> 05:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
automatically eligible because they're
 
05:28:05.590 --> 05:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
fired over covet
 
05:28:08.548 --> 05:28:08.558 align:start position:0%
reasons so it seems that the criteria
 
05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about now would
 
05:28:14.070 --> 05:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
still apply is that your understanding
 
05:28:16.070 --> 05:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
and that's a very good question
 
05:28:16.080 --> 05:28:17.590 align:start position:0%
and that's a very good question
represented

05:28:17.590 --> 05:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
represented
 
05:28:20.548 --> 05:28:20.558 align:start position:0%
in the department's reading of this bill
 
05:28:20.558 --> 05:28:21.590 align:start position:0%
in the department's reading of this bill
where

05:28:21.590 --> 05:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
it does not specifically state that an
 
05:28:26.310 --> 05:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
individual will be automatically
 
05:28:26.320 --> 05:28:27.430 align:start position:0%
individual will be automatically
eligible

05:28:27.430 --> 05:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
in this circumstance the department
 
05:28:31.750 --> 05:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
would still be applying its existing
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
policy that we've detailed today
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
it does require though if someone is
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
found eligible in that circumstance they
 
05:28:42.310 --> 05:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
would then receive an additional six
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
months of benefits
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
one item to point out with that regard
 
05:28:47.680 --> 05:28:48.470 align:start position:0%
one item to point out with that regard
is

05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:28:50.390 --> 05:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
the bill does
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
when it when it comes to the financing
 
05:28:55.270 --> 05:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
of those benefits
 
05:28:59.030 --> 05:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation financing
 
05:29:00.628 --> 05:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
there's a handful of us in the state
 
05:29:02.150 --> 05:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
that probably think it's an interesting
 
05:29:04.150 --> 05:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
topic all employers think it's
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
interesting every quarter though i can
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
guarantee you that because employers pay
 
05:29:11.910 --> 05:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
for the unemployment compensation system
 
05:29:15.510 --> 05:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
the trust fund is built of dollars paid
 
05:29:17.110 --> 05:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire
 
05:29:17.120 --> 05:29:18.628 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire
employers

05:29:18.628 --> 05:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
employers
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
so during the pandemic in state
 
05:29:24.270 --> 05:29:24.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits we paid out about
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
350 million dollars that came out of our
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
trust fund that was made up of tax
 
05:29:34.390 --> 05:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
payments from new hampshire business
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
so if we are talking about providing an
 
05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
additional six months of benefits to any
 
05:29:39.920 --> 05:29:41.190 align:start position:0%
additional six months of benefits to any
individual

05:29:41.190 --> 05:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
individual
 
05:29:44.390 --> 05:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
that is paid by new hampshire employers
 
05:29:46.310 --> 05:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
the bill says that
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
this would get funded by either
 
05:29:48.000 --> 05:29:49.350 align:start position:0%
this would get funded by either
employers

05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
employers
 
05:29:52.310 --> 05:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
or the department
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
for purposes here of unemployment comp
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
financing we are one in the same
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
the dollars that get paid out in a claim
 
05:30:03.110 --> 05:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
are dollars that the employer has paid
 
05:30:04.948 --> 05:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
into the fund
 
05:30:04.958 --> 05:30:06.390 align:start position:0%
into the fund
so

05:30:06.390 --> 05:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:08.470 --> 05:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
an important point to remember is that
 
05:30:10.830 --> 05:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
if we're increasing the duration of
 
05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility we're increasing the dollars
 
05:30:15.990 --> 05:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
that are coming out of the trust fund
 
05:30:19.110 --> 05:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
and depending on how that is structured
 
05:30:21.750 --> 05:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's either going to cause
 
05:30:25.190 --> 05:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:27.670 --> 05:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
effect on an employer's experience which
 
05:30:30.708 --> 05:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
causes their tax rate to go up
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
or if it's direct charge to the trust
 
05:30:35.270 --> 05:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
fund then it's going to lower the
 
05:30:38.470 --> 05:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
balance in the trust fund thus delaying
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
the time that employers get their fund
 
05:30:44.230 --> 05:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
balance reductions to their tax rate
 
05:30:47.910 --> 05:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
and that's for our for-profit employers
 
05:30:50.548 --> 05:30:50.558 align:start position:0%
our non-profit employers
 
05:30:52.150 --> 05:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
our hospitals
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
and other non-profits they are largely
 
05:30:57.750 --> 05:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursing employers it's important
 
05:31:00.070 --> 05:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
that we remember them
 
05:31:02.150 --> 05:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
that means that they pay back to the
 
05:31:05.030 --> 05:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
fund dollar for dollar for every benefit
 
05:31:06.628 --> 05:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
that goes up
 
05:31:06.638 --> 05:31:07.590 align:start position:0%
that goes up
so

05:31:07.590 --> 05:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:31:10.350 --> 05:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:31:13.110 --> 05:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
92 claims that we had from the health
 
05:31:15.270 --> 05:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
care sector
 
05:31:17.670 --> 05:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
if those claims that were rejected were
 
05:31:20.070 --> 05:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
paid and we paid an additional six
 
05:31:22.070 --> 05:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
months of benefits
 
05:31:23.910 --> 05:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
those are employers that are reimbursers
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
they pay back dollar for dollar they
 
05:31:27.750 --> 05:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
would have to pay back to the fund for
 
05:31:29.430 --> 05:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
those benefits
 
05:31:31.670 --> 05:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
if those individuals were paid for that
 
05:31:34.390 --> 05:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
full enhanced duration of
 
05:31:37.990 --> 05:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
26 weeks plus an additional
 
05:31:40.708 --> 05:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
six months so for a full year
 
05:31:43.270 --> 05:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
you're looking at about a 1.2 million
 
05:31:43.280 --> 05:31:44.390 align:start position:0%
you're looking at about a 1.2 million
dollar

05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
05:31:44.400 --> 05:31:45.830 align:start position:0%
dollar
charge

05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
charge
 
05:31:47.590 --> 05:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
to our health care employers in the
 
05:31:47.600 --> 05:31:49.190 align:start position:0%
to our health care employers in the
state

05:31:49.190 --> 05:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:31:49.200 --> 05:31:50.868 align:start position:0%
state
now

05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
with our for profits it's calculated
 
05:31:55.510 --> 05:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
differently but in each and every case
 
05:31:57.670 --> 05:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
there would be an impact on that
 
05:32:01.350 --> 05:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
employer's experience in their tax rate
 
05:32:02.548 --> 05:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
but again
 
05:32:04.788 --> 05:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
it all comes down to
 
05:32:07.190 --> 05:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
with unemployment comp financing this is
 
05:32:07.200 --> 05:32:08.230 align:start position:0%
with unemployment comp financing this is
not

05:32:08.230 --> 05:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:32:10.708 --> 05:32:10.718 align:start position:0%
financed by the general fund this is not
 
05:32:12.548 --> 05:32:12.558 align:start position:0%
financed separately from the department
 
05:32:14.788 --> 05:32:14.798 align:start position:0%
or the federal government this is paid
 
05:32:16.070 --> 05:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
for by
 
05:32:17.990 --> 05:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
our employers both for-profit and
 
05:32:20.708 --> 05:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
non-profit in the state
 
05:32:22.230 --> 05:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:32:24.310 --> 05:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:32:26.230 --> 05:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer you're always
 
05:32:29.110 --> 05:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:30.548 --> 05:32:30.558 align:start position:0%
you've covered
 
05:32:33.990 --> 05:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
roman one in the bill fairly clearly um
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
could you speak to roman two and three
 
05:32:38.788 --> 05:32:38.798 align:start position:0%
with regard to the 14 days
 
05:32:41.830 --> 05:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
the court hearing within 14 days
 
05:32:46.390 --> 05:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the recovery of
 
05:32:49.030 --> 05:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
costs and legal fees to
 
05:32:50.708 --> 05:32:50.718 align:start position:0%
see how that compares to the
 
05:32:54.070 --> 05:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
department's current practices
 
05:32:56.868 --> 05:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you representative so
 
05:32:58.830 --> 05:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
i would have to defer to the
 
05:32:59.830 --> 05:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor on
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
roman two
 
05:33:03.830 --> 05:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
05:33:05.910 --> 05:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
there might be a different intent
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
with regard to an expedited court here
 
05:33:10.230 --> 05:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure what the sponsor is
 
05:33:11.990 --> 05:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
referring to there
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
and with making the change to
 
05:33:19.190 --> 05:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
rsa 275 and not 282a there might be a
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
different intent
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
however the
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:27.350 --> 05:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
appeals for unemployment compensation
 
05:33:27.360 --> 05:33:28.548 align:start position:0%
appeals for unemployment compensation
purposes

05:33:28.548 --> 05:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
05:33:31.590 --> 05:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
we largely are administrative appeals
 
05:33:34.230 --> 05:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
until an individual gets up to the new
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court
 
05:33:36.080 --> 05:33:36.788 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court
so

05:33:36.788 --> 05:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:39.750 --> 05:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
if you apply for benefits and receive a
 
05:33:42.070 --> 05:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
decision that you disagree with you
 
05:33:44.628 --> 05:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
appeal that decision to the department
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
we have an internal appeals unit you
 
05:33:49.990 --> 05:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
have a hearing that's right now going to
 
05:33:52.868 --> 05:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
be remote either on zoom or going to be
 
05:33:54.310 --> 05:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
on telephone
 
05:33:56.070 --> 05:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
and you have your opportunity to make
 
05:33:58.948 --> 05:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
your case to why you should be eligible
 
05:34:00.868 --> 05:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
if you disagree with that decision you
 
05:34:02.788 --> 05:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
then have another layer of
 
05:34:05.350 --> 05:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
administrative review that you can take
 
05:34:08.788 --> 05:34:08.798 align:start position:0%
that you can take advantage of
 
05:34:12.868 --> 05:34:12.878 align:start position:0%
then have another layer to our appeals
 
05:34:15.430 --> 05:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
board so a separate
 
05:34:18.070 --> 05:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
body but administratively attached to
 
05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
the department
 
05:34:22.390 --> 05:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
they then refuse to review that decision
 
05:34:24.150 --> 05:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately if you disagree with
 
05:34:25.910 --> 05:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
that you can take that to a
 
05:34:27.510 --> 05:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
discretionary review to the new
 
05:34:30.150 --> 05:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court so
 
05:34:31.990 --> 05:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
knowing what our appeal structure looks
 
05:34:32.000 --> 05:34:33.190 align:start position:0%
knowing what our appeal structure looks
like

05:34:33.190 --> 05:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the intent there is
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
with roma 2 but i would i would
 
05:34:40.150 --> 05:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
defer to the the sponsor to want to
 
05:34:44.070 --> 05:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:45.830 --> 05:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
all right representative avalani
 
05:34:47.830 --> 05:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
followed by cahill
 
05:34:49.990 --> 05:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
mr clerk did you want to ask a question
 
05:34:53.590 --> 05:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
or do you have a question mr clerk
 
05:34:53.600 --> 05:34:54.868 align:start position:0%
or do you have a question mr clerk
john

05:34:54.868 --> 05:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
john
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
did you want to ask about something
 
05:34:57.670 --> 05:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
there or you just want to be in line to
 
05:34:58.948 --> 05:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
05:34:59.830 --> 05:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
avalani cahill
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you deputy
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner this is going to dovetail
 
05:35:07.990 --> 05:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
very nicely into what representative
 
05:35:09.670 --> 05:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
sullivan asked
 
05:35:12.628 --> 05:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
say there was an additional six months
 
05:35:14.070 --> 05:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
that was
 
05:35:17.750 --> 05:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
added to the unemployment for certain
 
05:35:17.760 --> 05:35:18.830 align:start position:0%
added to the unemployment for certain
mandated

05:35:18.830 --> 05:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
05:35:21.190 --> 05:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
policies how would you quantify the
 
05:35:23.110 --> 05:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund and the cost to
 
05:35:23.120 --> 05:35:24.470 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund and the cost to
employers

05:35:24.470 --> 05:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
employers
 
05:35:26.070 --> 05:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
and you've already explained the profit
 
05:35:27.910 --> 05:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofit with the unemployment fund
 
05:35:29.590 --> 05:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
need to be larger with the cost to
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
employers need to be more in order to
 
05:35:32.310 --> 05:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
cover that
 
05:35:34.390 --> 05:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
possible possibility of having one
 
05:35:38.230 --> 05:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:40.948 --> 05:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question so
 
05:35:40.958 --> 05:35:42.150 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question so
it

05:35:42.150 --> 05:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:35:44.150 --> 05:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
i can say with certainty that it would
 
05:35:45.590 --> 05:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
be a further
 
05:35:47.990 --> 05:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
drain on the unemployment trust fund
 
05:35:49.830 --> 05:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about additional
 
05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
benefits that have to come out of the
 
05:35:54.548 --> 05:35:54.558 align:start position:0%
trust fund there is not another source
 
05:35:56.788 --> 05:35:56.798 align:start position:0%
for those payments
 
05:35:58.628 --> 05:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
so that would be additional dollars
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
coming out of the trust fund
 
05:36:04.150 --> 05:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
and for employers that are involved in
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
those separations it would be a negative
 
05:36:10.230 --> 05:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
impact on their tax rate their tax rate
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
is determined by
 
05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
their experience with the unemployment
 
05:36:15.830 --> 05:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
system so we look at taxes paid in and
 
05:36:18.548 --> 05:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
then we look at benefits paid out to
 
05:36:21.030 --> 05:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
your former employees and so that would
 
05:36:23.590 --> 05:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
be an addition that would be additional
 
05:36:25.510 --> 05:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
benefits that would be charged against
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
that employer's experience your
 
05:36:30.070 --> 05:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
experience then determines what your
 
05:36:32.470 --> 05:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
rate is going to be which statutory
 
05:36:36.310 --> 05:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
table within 282 a you find yourself
 
05:36:39.990 --> 05:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
so the more you pay in in taxes the less
 
05:36:42.470 --> 05:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
we pay up benefits to your employees the
 
05:36:44.390 --> 05:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
lower your rate
 
05:36:46.628 --> 05:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
right now average
 
05:36:46.638 --> 05:36:48.150 align:start position:0%
right now average
for-profit

05:36:48.150 --> 05:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
employer tax rate in the state is
 
05:36:54.390 --> 05:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
even though we just paid 176
 
05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
000 people or about 25 of new
 
05:37:02.708 --> 05:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire's workforce unemployment
 
05:37:04.948 --> 05:37:04.958 align:start position:0%
benefits over the last two years
 
05:37:08.150 --> 05:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
so employer tax rates have come down
 
05:37:10.390 --> 05:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
surprisingly fast
 
05:37:11.910 --> 05:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
much faster than they did during the
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
great recession
 
05:37:16.310 --> 05:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
as you remember those rates stagnated up
 
05:37:18.230 --> 05:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
in the the three percent
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
and plus range for a few years
 
05:37:25.270 --> 05:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
following uh that 2010
 
05:37:27.510 --> 05:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
2011 period
 
05:37:30.628 --> 05:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
so employers would see a negative
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
negative impact
 
05:37:33.830 --> 05:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
on their tax rates because we're looking
 
05:37:33.840 --> 05:37:34.708 align:start position:0%
on their tax rates because we're looking
at

05:37:34.708 --> 05:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
additional benefits being paid out
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
that the balance in the trust fund
 
05:37:42.948 --> 05:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
determines when employers get reductions
 
05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
to their rates
 
05:37:46.390 --> 05:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature in
 
05:37:47.750 --> 05:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
05:37:50.310 --> 05:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
it was part of the trailer bill
 
05:37:52.628 --> 05:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
the last budget made some changes to
 
05:37:52.638 --> 05:37:54.150 align:start position:0%
the last budget made some changes to
that

05:37:54.150 --> 05:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:37:56.390 --> 05:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
right now employers get a reduction to
 
05:37:58.548 --> 05:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
their tax rate when the fund equals or
 
05:38:01.590 --> 05:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
exceeds 250 million dollars for a full
 
05:38:01.600 --> 05:38:02.548 align:start position:0%
exceeds 250 million dollars for a full
quarter

05:38:02.548 --> 05:38:02.558 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
05:38:05.670 --> 05:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
the fund right now is at 194 million
 
05:38:05.680 --> 05:38:06.948 align:start position:0%
the fund right now is at 194 million
dollars

05:38:06.948 --> 05:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:38:09.590 --> 05:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
we project that the fund will be at that
 
05:38:12.628 --> 05:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
250 million dollar mark by the fourth
 
05:38:15.110 --> 05:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
quarter of this year
 
05:38:16.868 --> 05:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
it's pretty close remember you have to
 
05:38:18.708 --> 05:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
maintain that balance
 
05:38:20.708 --> 05:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
at at least 250
 
05:38:23.270 --> 05:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
for the full quarter but right now our
 
05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
forecast shows that 0.5 reduction to
 
05:38:29.830 --> 05:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
employer tax rates triggered by that 250
 
05:38:32.628 --> 05:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
million dollar balance being reached
 
05:38:34.470 --> 05:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
being realized for employers in the
 
05:38:37.750 --> 05:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
first quarter of 2023 the most expensive
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
quarter for employers in the state and
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
less those that have a seasonal pattern
 
05:38:44.310 --> 05:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
to their employer
 
05:38:44.320 --> 05:38:45.030 align:start position:0%
to their employer
the

05:38:45.030 --> 05:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:38:47.430 --> 05:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
next trigger that employers get a full 1
 
05:38:49.990 --> 05:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
reduction to their rate is at 350
 
05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
million and then a the maximum rate
 
05:38:55.830 --> 05:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
reduction of 1.5 percent kicks in at 400
 
05:38:58.390 --> 05:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
million and to put those rate reductions
 
05:39:00.548 --> 05:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
into perspective to perspective so it's
 
05:39:03.670 --> 05:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
a 0.5 reduction a 1 reduction in a one
 
05:39:05.670 --> 05:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
and a half percent reduction a new
 
05:39:07.510 --> 05:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
employer coming into new hampshire
 
05:39:09.430 --> 05:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
starts with a two point seven percent
 
05:39:12.628 --> 05:39:12.638 align:start position:0%
rate they pay 2.7 percent on the first
 
05:39:16.628 --> 05:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
14 000 in annual wages per employee so
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
when you start talking about 0.5
 
05:39:21.990 --> 05:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
1.0 and a 1.5 reduction it's a
 
05:39:24.948 --> 05:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
significant reduction for that rate that
 
05:39:26.868 --> 05:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
an employer finds themselves at and
 
05:39:29.190 --> 05:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
right now we're at about a 1.6
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
average tax rate across all private
 
05:39:34.310 --> 05:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
sector employers
 
05:39:35.830 --> 05:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative cahill followed by
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative mackey
 
05:39:39.510 --> 05:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
05:39:41.670 --> 05:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
lavers for uh
 
05:39:43.750 --> 05:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
explaining the impact potential impact
 
05:39:46.788 --> 05:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh for
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
private employers particularly the
 
05:39:48.718 --> 05:39:50.070 align:start position:0%
private employers particularly the
hospitals

05:39:50.070 --> 05:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
05:39:52.230 --> 05:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
what about public employers can you
 
05:39:54.230 --> 05:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
speak up a little bit mike i'm sorry
 
05:39:56.470 --> 05:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
what about how would this affect public
 
05:39:57.750 --> 05:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
employers i'm assumed that they would
 
05:40:00.390 --> 05:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
also be you know participating in this
 
05:40:02.548 --> 05:40:02.558 align:start position:0%
and shouldn't it be a fiscal note
 
05:40:06.788 --> 05:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
to uh to explain that to us
 
05:40:09.030 --> 05:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question so public
 
05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
employers in the state they are as you
 
05:40:11.200 --> 05:40:12.390 align:start position:0%
employers in the state they are as you
noted

05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
noted
 
05:40:13.750 --> 05:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
participants in the unemployment
 
05:40:15.830 --> 05:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
compensation system
 
05:40:15.840 --> 05:40:16.628 align:start position:0%
compensation system
so

05:40:16.628 --> 05:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:40:20.150 --> 05:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
the state as an employer is a required
 
05:40:20.160 --> 05:40:21.750 align:start position:0%
the state as an employer is a required
reimbursement

05:40:21.750 --> 05:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
so employees last employed by the state
 
05:40:27.510 --> 05:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
that qualify for unemployment benefits
 
05:40:29.830 --> 05:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
the state then reimburses the trust fund
 
05:40:32.470 --> 05:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
dollar for dollar for those payments
 
05:40:32.480 --> 05:40:33.470 align:start position:0%
dollar for dollar for those payments
our

05:40:33.470 --> 05:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:40:36.310 --> 05:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities and our county employers
 
05:40:38.310 --> 05:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
and our school districts
 
05:40:38.320 --> 05:40:39.590 align:start position:0%
and our school districts
they

05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
can elect to either be a reimburser
 
05:40:45.190 --> 05:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
and only pay
 
05:40:47.350 --> 05:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
to the trust fund when they have an
 
05:40:49.830 --> 05:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
individual that qualifies for benefits
 
05:40:51.910 --> 05:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
but when they do pay its dollar for
 
05:40:54.788 --> 05:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
dollar like the example i said of
 
05:40:56.788 --> 05:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
non-profit hospitals
 
05:40:58.628 --> 05:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
but they have the choice they could
 
05:41:00.868 --> 05:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
elect to be a tax-paying employer like a
 
05:41:03.830 --> 05:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
for-profit employer and in that case
 
05:41:06.548 --> 05:41:06.558 align:start position:0%
they would pay quarterly with a rate
 
05:41:09.110 --> 05:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
based upon their experience largely your
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
public employers
 
05:41:13.350 --> 05:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
the last time i looked for your local
 
05:41:16.230 --> 05:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
public county and school districts
 
05:41:18.708 --> 05:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
about 90 percent of them elect to
 
05:41:21.430 --> 05:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
reimburse and not be a tax bank employer
 
05:41:22.948 --> 05:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
but yes they do participate in the
 
05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation system they
 
05:41:27.030 --> 05:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
would be impacted by any change to
 
05:41:29.030 --> 05:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility or change and duration
 
05:41:29.040 --> 05:41:33.270 align:start position:0%
eligibility or change and duration
benefits

05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:35.430 --> 05:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
and all of this is based on really
 
05:41:37.270 --> 05:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
something that developed that neither
 
05:41:39.830 --> 05:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
the employer nor the employee could
 
05:41:39.840 --> 05:41:41.030 align:start position:0%
the employer nor the employee could
predict

05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
predict
 
05:41:43.750 --> 05:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
how one would respond to a situation i
 
05:41:45.270 --> 05:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
know in healthcare people expect that
 
05:41:46.868 --> 05:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
they have to take all the vaccines as
 
05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
they come up
 
05:41:48.000 --> 05:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
they come up
but

05:41:49.030 --> 05:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:41:50.628 --> 05:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
you would have no idea whether you had
 
05:41:52.230 --> 05:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
an employee who would be averse to
 
05:41:55.990 --> 05:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
taking a vaccine that was recommended
 
05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:03.270 --> 05:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
correct and we would look you know we
 
05:42:05.110 --> 05:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
would regardless of whether or not the
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
individual applying is coming from a
 
05:42:09.590 --> 05:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
public sector employer or a private
 
05:42:12.310 --> 05:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
sector employer we would look at
 
05:42:16.868 --> 05:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:18.788 --> 05:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
representative mackey
 
05:42:20.708 --> 05:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
followed by representative mendeville
 
05:42:22.548 --> 05:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:42:24.628 --> 05:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question um the representative
 
05:42:26.390 --> 05:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
said earlier that
 
05:42:28.548 --> 05:42:28.558 align:start position:0%
it was a legitimate reason to turn down
 
05:42:31.190 --> 05:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
employment if you're afraid of covid
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
05:42:35.990 --> 05:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
represent just to make sure i heard that
 
05:42:37.430 --> 05:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would be a legitimate
 
05:42:42.150 --> 05:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
reason to turn down employment because
 
05:42:44.948 --> 05:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
of fear of
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
coping 19. yes
 
05:42:47.760 --> 05:42:48.548 align:start position:0%
coping 19. yes
so

05:42:48.548 --> 05:42:48.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
with right now
 
05:42:52.230 --> 05:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
the only
 
05:42:52.240 --> 05:42:53.430 align:start position:0%
the only
program

05:42:53.430 --> 05:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:42:55.830 --> 05:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
for unemployment benefits
 
05:42:57.030 --> 05:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire is our
 
05:42:59.350 --> 05:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
regular state unemployment program
 
05:42:59.360 --> 05:43:00.070 align:start position:0%
regular state unemployment program
so

05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:43:01.110 --> 05:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
if you are
 
05:43:03.910 --> 05:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
unemployed through no fault of your own
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
and you have
 
05:43:07.270 --> 05:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
qualifying earnings
 
05:43:09.750 --> 05:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
from your prior four quarters
 
05:43:12.470 --> 05:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
you may be eligible for benefits
 
05:43:12.480 --> 05:43:13.510 align:start position:0%
you may be eligible for benefits
but

05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:43:15.990 --> 05:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
the reasons that we saw for unemployment
 
05:43:16.000 --> 05:43:17.230 align:start position:0%
the reasons that we saw for unemployment
during

05:43:17.230 --> 05:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
during
 
05:43:17.240 --> 05:43:18.948 align:start position:0%
during
2020

05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
2020
 
05:43:23.190 --> 05:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
and 2021 with individuals were
 
05:43:25.750 --> 05:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
able to apply for benefits
 
05:43:28.470 --> 05:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
because they were unable to go into the
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
workplace due to concerns around coven
 
05:43:33.270 --> 05:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
those reasons that were articulated in
 
05:43:36.470 --> 05:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
the cares act that program is gone new
 
05:43:38.548 --> 05:43:38.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire has not been a participant in
 
05:43:41.590 --> 05:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
that program since june of 21 it expired
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
for all states in september of 21
 
05:43:45.040 --> 05:43:45.990 align:start position:0%
for all states in september of 21
so

05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:43:48.470 --> 05:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
05:43:51.030 --> 05:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
leaving employment i guess would be
 
05:43:53.510 --> 05:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
in in this in the scenario that you
 
05:43:53.520 --> 05:43:54.708 align:start position:0%
in in this in the scenario that you
described

05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
described
 
05:43:57.590 --> 05:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
someone leaving just because of a fear
 
05:44:00.070 --> 05:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
of covid
 
05:44:02.150 --> 05:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
that would largely be looked at as a
 
05:44:04.230 --> 05:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
voluntary quit but we might be looking
 
05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
at some medical issues
 
05:44:08.548 --> 05:44:08.558 align:start position:0%
that the employer would certainly have
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
to consider if there were an
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
accommodation issue so that situation
 
05:44:14.948 --> 05:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
could get complicated pretty quickly
 
05:44:14.958 --> 05:44:16.470 align:start position:0%
could get complicated pretty quickly
well

05:44:16.470 --> 05:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:44:17.990 --> 05:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up uh
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
i understand that is no longer the case
 
05:44:21.510 --> 05:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
but that was the case where people were
 
05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
especially fearful of coburn
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
with the recent increase in adverse
 
05:44:27.990 --> 05:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
reactions and the reporting of adverse
 
05:44:28.000 --> 05:44:29.190 align:start position:0%
reactions and the reporting of adverse
reactions

05:44:29.190 --> 05:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
reactions
 
05:44:30.628 --> 05:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be somewhat hypocritical to
 
05:44:33.590 --> 05:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
not allow fear of the vaccine also to be
 
05:44:35.670 --> 05:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
used in the same way as the fear of
 
05:44:38.830 --> 05:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
coving was during the peak of the
 
05:44:38.840 --> 05:44:40.628 align:start position:0%
coving was during the peak of the
outbreak

05:44:40.628 --> 05:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
outbreak
 
05:44:44.230 --> 05:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
um if there were a desired change to
 
05:44:45.910 --> 05:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
state eligibility for unemployment
 
05:44:45.920 --> 05:44:47.670 align:start position:0%
state eligibility for unemployment
benefits

05:44:47.670 --> 05:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
the department very much respects
 
05:44:52.310 --> 05:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
this committee's role in the
 
05:44:54.390 --> 05:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
legislature's role in setting policy so
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
if that were a
 
05:44:57.590 --> 05:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
decision made by this body we would
 
05:44:57.600 --> 05:44:58.948 align:start position:0%
decision made by this body we would
certainly

05:44:58.948 --> 05:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:45:00.310 --> 05:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
implement it as
 
05:45:01.830 --> 05:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
as it was enacted
 
05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:06.830 --> 05:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
where was it minimal thank you mr
 
05:45:11.270 --> 05:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
chairman i i noted in your

is

05:45:28.948 --> 05:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:45:30.628 --> 05:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
where there's non-compliance with an

where there's non-compliance with an
employer-mandated

05:45:32.390 --> 05:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
employer-mandated
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirement we've heard
 
05:45:37.830 --> 05:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
questions in the committee before about
 
05:45:40.628 --> 05:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
whether something that was mandated by
 
05:45:42.390 --> 05:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government say
 
05:45:45.470 --> 05:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
was not necessarily an
 
05:45:45.480 --> 05:45:47.110 align:start position:0%
was not necessarily an
employer-mandated

05:45:47.110 --> 05:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
employer-mandated
 
05:45:49.030 --> 05:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination so for example in the
 
05:45:51.190 --> 05:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
context of the
 
05:45:53.670 --> 05:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
federal health care
 
05:45:53.680 --> 05:45:54.708 align:start position:0%
federal health care
mandate

05:45:54.708 --> 05:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
05:45:55.990 --> 05:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
which has been
 
05:45:59.510 --> 05:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:02.948 --> 05:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
would you read this
 
05:46:05.910 --> 05:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
legislation if it went through as
 
05:46:12.070 --> 05:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:15.430 --> 05:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
so that's a very good question
 
05:46:15.440 --> 05:46:16.628 align:start position:0%
so that's a very good question
fortunately

05:46:16.628 --> 05:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
fortunately
 
05:46:19.110 --> 05:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
the department works very closely
 
05:46:21.990 --> 05:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
with attorney general from ella
 
05:46:23.350 --> 05:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
and his office
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
with questions like the one you've
 
05:46:27.510 --> 05:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
described where we could potentially
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:31.680 --> 05:46:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
inconsistency

05:46:33.030 --> 05:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
inconsistency
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
um if if we were confronted with that
 
05:46:37.270 --> 05:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
would we know with the the federal rule
 
05:46:39.750 --> 05:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
being uh currently upheld
 
05:46:42.070 --> 05:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh for um employers that receive
 
05:46:44.230 --> 05:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid funds
 
05:46:46.948 --> 05:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
um and we had a different
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
requirement uh we would certainly seek
 
05:46:51.590 --> 05:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
counsel from the attorney general's
 
05:46:53.110 --> 05:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
office and it might be something that we
 
05:46:55.110 --> 05:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
were seeking opinions from
 
05:46:58.868 --> 05:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:00.788 --> 05:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:47:02.708 --> 05:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
assuming that this
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
did apply
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
to such circumstances
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
would you have
 
05:47:10.310 --> 05:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
an enlarged concern about the
 
05:47:12.948 --> 05:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
non-compliance issue you started with in
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
your testimony where the federal
 
05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
government had mandated
 
05:47:20.948 --> 05:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
a vaccine rule
 
05:47:23.030 --> 05:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
and our
 
05:47:24.948 --> 05:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
statutes were
 
05:47:27.750 --> 05:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
changing the application of the
 
05:47:30.470 --> 05:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit
 
05:47:33.750 --> 05:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
contrary to what was
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:38.628 --> 05:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
it would certainly
 
05:47:40.708 --> 05:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh that situation if you know an
 
05:47:43.750 --> 05:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
employer required
 
05:47:46.948 --> 05:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
to have a vaccination policy in that
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
context that would certainly
 
05:47:51.110 --> 05:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
be considered a way towards the
 
05:47:54.070 --> 05:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
reasonableness of that employer's policy
 
05:47:57.110 --> 05:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
when we look at the circumstances that
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
someone would find themselves in filing
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
for unemployment benefits but it would
 
05:48:01.510 --> 05:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
certainly way in favor of the
 
05:48:05.670 --> 05:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:05.680 --> 05:48:08.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:09.670 --> 05:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you again
 
05:48:13.350 --> 05:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner um given the
 
05:48:16.708 --> 05:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
cost factors across multiple
 
05:48:19.750 --> 05:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
employers non-profit profit
 
05:48:21.830 --> 05:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
public employees private employers could
 
05:48:23.670 --> 05:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
you quantify
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.548 --> 05:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:37.510 --> 05:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:39.750 --> 05:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
there would have to be
 
05:48:42.150 --> 05:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
some speculation obviously
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to the rate at which
 
05:48:46.150 --> 05:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
individuals would file
 
05:48:49.350 --> 05:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly quantify the cost
 
05:48:52.070 --> 05:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
of those claims that we have received
 
05:48:54.150 --> 05:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
that i had touched upon earlier with
 
05:48:57.030 --> 05:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
those 134 claims and then the health
 
05:48:58.310 --> 05:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
care claims and what that would have
 
05:49:00.310 --> 05:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
cost to our health care employers if
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
they had all been required to be paid
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then paid an additional six months
 
05:49:07.190 --> 05:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly do that
 
05:49:08.628 --> 05:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman with the
 
05:49:10.948 --> 05:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
chairman's approval of course
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
pardon with your approval of course yes
 
05:49:16.708 --> 05:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:19.670 --> 05:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:49:22.070 --> 05:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative cahill
 
05:49:23.990 --> 05:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
05:49:25.510 --> 05:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
again mr labors
 
05:49:27.910 --> 05:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
reading reading the bill
 
05:49:30.230 --> 05:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know to have discussed how you have
 
05:49:32.070 --> 05:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
an appeals process
 
05:49:34.788 --> 05:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
and you have criteria that you follow
 
05:49:36.948 --> 05:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
and we agree we seem to be agreeing that
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
six months of extension
 
05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
is perilous for our employers
 
05:49:46.628 --> 05:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative and i would have to defer
 
05:49:50.948 --> 05:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
to the committee on that one
 
05:49:52.948 --> 05:49:52.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:49:55.510 --> 05:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
i have uh just one brief
 
05:50:01.590 --> 05:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
the ten percent of the cases you did
 
05:50:03.590 --> 05:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
approve of the
 
05:50:05.270 --> 05:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
health care
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
was that because
 
05:50:09.670 --> 05:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
the department felt
 
05:50:11.830 --> 05:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
that the requirements from the employer
 
05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:16.638 --> 05:50:18.548 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:50:18.548 --> 05:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
with regard to the the 10
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
fallen within the health care sector
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
that have been allowed
 
05:50:27.510 --> 05:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of different scenarios
 
05:50:29.190 --> 05:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
that we've seen
 
05:50:32.150 --> 05:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
one has been with
 
05:50:34.868 --> 05:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
individuals that raised a religious
 
05:50:37.750 --> 05:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
request for a religious exception
 
05:50:40.150 --> 05:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
and employers allowing that
 
05:50:43.270 --> 05:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing it but then being unable to
 
05:50:45.510 --> 05:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
accommodate it
 
05:50:47.590 --> 05:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
in those types of situations where the
 
05:50:49.350 --> 05:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
employer again has done the due
 
05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
diligence they've reviewed the
 
05:50:53.190 --> 05:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
individual's request for that type of
 
05:50:56.230 --> 05:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
exception to the vaccine requirement
 
05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
they've granted it but are unable to
 
05:51:00.788 --> 05:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
accommodate it we pay those individuals
 
05:51:03.270 --> 05:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
05:51:05.750 --> 05:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
another common situation that we've
 
05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
we've seen in some of those that have
 
05:51:08.548 --> 05:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
been payable
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
have been with individuals that are 100
 
05:51:12.240 --> 05:51:13.590 align:start position:0%
have been with individuals that are 100
remote

05:51:13.590 --> 05:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
remote
 
05:51:13.600 --> 05:51:14.708 align:start position:0%
remote
so

05:51:14.708 --> 05:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
no plans
 
05:51:18.788 --> 05:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
for bringing them back into the facility
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
and they are 100 remote worker but yet
 
05:51:24.150 --> 05:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps for ease of administration and
 
05:51:25.430 --> 05:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
the requirement
 
05:51:25.440 --> 05:51:26.708 align:start position:0%
the requirement
everyone

05:51:26.708 --> 05:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
05:51:29.670 --> 05:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
has been required to be vaccinated an
 
05:51:31.990 --> 05:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
individual in that type of situation
 
05:51:34.390 --> 05:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
would be found eligible because again
 
05:51:36.708 --> 05:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
they are remote with no plans to be
 
05:51:38.708 --> 05:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
brought in the facility so that's a
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
couple of examples that we've seen for
 
05:51:40.558 --> 05:51:41.510 align:start position:0%
couple of examples that we've seen for
that

05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:51:44.070 --> 05:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
the small percentage of claims in the
 
05:51:45.350 --> 05:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
health care sector that have been
 
05:51:45.360 --> 05:51:46.788 align:start position:0%
health care sector that have been
payable

payable
 
05:51:48.548 --> 05:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
okay as a follow-up to representative
 
05:51:50.868 --> 05:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
avaloni's question
 
05:51:53.670 --> 05:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
in the past if you've seen
 
05:51:56.070 --> 05:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
bills requiring extended
 
05:51:58.150 --> 05:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits to
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state that are
 
05:52:02.230 --> 05:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
self-funded in this case wouldn't you
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:11.430 --> 05:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
it would it's unusual uh whether
 
05:52:13.830 --> 05:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
not where there being a potential impact
 
05:52:13.840 --> 05:52:15.190 align:start position:0%
not where there being a potential impact
to

05:52:15.190 --> 05:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:52:16.548 --> 05:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
local government
 
05:52:16.558 --> 05:52:17.910 align:start position:0%
local government
um

05:52:17.910 --> 05:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:19.590 --> 05:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
state government as well
 
05:52:22.070 --> 05:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
that there wouldn't be a financial note
 
05:52:25.110 --> 05:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
i would agree with you there but
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
it is a it's a challenging exercise to
 
05:52:31.670 --> 05:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
calculate out that cost
 
05:52:34.548 --> 05:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
again based on
 
05:52:36.868 --> 05:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
what we'd be a lot of assumptions that
 
05:52:38.310 --> 05:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
would need to be made
 
05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to always approach any sort
 
05:52:40.558 --> 05:52:41.430 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to always approach any sort
of

05:52:41.430 --> 05:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:52:43.590 --> 05:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal cost for
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
local government with with regard to
 
05:52:48.868 --> 05:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
that this particular requirement um we
 
05:52:52.470 --> 05:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
would provide you with plenty of caveats
 
05:52:54.708 --> 05:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:52:56.230 --> 05:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that we would submit but
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
again we would do our best
 
05:53:00.150 --> 05:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very additional questions for
 
05:53:02.070 --> 05:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
the deputy commissioner
 
05:53:05.510 --> 05:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
see none thank you really appreciate it
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
i'll call paula minahan from the new
 
05:53:09.910 --> 05:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association followed
 
05:53:19.030 --> 05:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:21.030 --> 05:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
05:53:23.110 --> 05:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
the committee paula minihan senior vice
 
05:53:24.548 --> 05:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
president state government relations for
 
05:53:26.070 --> 05:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hospital association
 
05:53:27.990 --> 05:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals the
 
05:53:29.830 --> 05:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
hospital association is opposed to house
 
05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill 1377
 
05:53:34.390 --> 05:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
it is our position that employers have
 
05:53:35.990 --> 05:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
the right to determine what is best for
 
05:53:38.230 --> 05:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
their employees and their clients
 
05:53:40.470 --> 05:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
patients and our patrons requiring
 
05:53:42.470 --> 05:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinations of health care workers for
 
05:53:44.868 --> 05:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases is not new for
 
05:53:46.390 --> 05:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals in new hampshire and i think
 
05:53:48.868 --> 05:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
it's important to note this bill is not
 
05:53:51.030 --> 05:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
specific to covet so this would
 
05:53:52.708 --> 05:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
definitely impact
 
05:53:55.030 --> 05:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals hospitals have required
 
05:53:57.190 --> 05:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
vaccination against several communicable
 
05:53:59.110 --> 05:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
and deadly diseases such as mumps
 
05:54:02.150 --> 05:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
measles rubella chickenpox dip theory of
 
05:54:04.470 --> 05:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
tetanus pertussis and influenza as a
 
05:54:06.230 --> 05:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
condition of employment with the same
 
05:54:06.240 --> 05:54:07.110 align:start position:0%
condition of employment with the same
types

05:54:07.110 --> 05:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
types
 
05:54:08.948 --> 05:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
of medical and religious exemptions
 
05:54:12.230 --> 05:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
allowed for under covid19 vaccines we
 
05:54:14.310 --> 05:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
believe it's absolutely the right to do
 
05:54:16.230 --> 05:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
for the health and safety of our
 
05:54:18.390 --> 05:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
patients our staff and citizens of new
 
05:54:20.470 --> 05:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the vast majority of
 
05:54:22.310 --> 05:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
hospital staff have been vaccinated
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
against covet and have received
 
05:54:26.230 --> 05:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
exemptions and we've heard from many
 
05:54:27.750 --> 05:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
health care workers who support the
 
05:54:30.070 --> 05:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirement to protect their
 
05:54:32.230 --> 05:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
health and that of patients one note i
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
need to state for the record the cdc.gov
 
05:54:38.548 --> 05:54:38.558 align:start position:0%
faqs lists the ingredients of all the
 
05:54:41.110 --> 05:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines and i just wanted to point that
 
05:54:42.948 --> 05:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
out because it has been stated a couple
 
05:54:45.030 --> 05:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
times and i think that was
 
05:54:48.070 --> 05:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
incorrectly stated that the vaccine
 
05:54:49.750 --> 05:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
ingredients are not available they're
 
05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely available on the cdc.gov
 
05:54:55.270 --> 05:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
website and i encourage anyone that is
 
05:54:57.830 --> 05:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
curious to go on and see
 
05:54:59.670 --> 05:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
the fact is that very very few
 
05:55:02.548 --> 05:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
individuals as mr laver said have either
 
05:55:06.070 --> 05:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
chosen to leave or have
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
due to with a hospital due to this
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
requirement and have relief of their
 
05:55:12.470 --> 05:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
position and i think his data supports
 
05:55:15.030 --> 05:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
that however this bill could cause a
 
05:55:17.030 --> 05:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
perverse incentive to encourage
 
05:55:19.830 --> 05:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
individuals to choose to not comply with
 
05:55:21.430 --> 05:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
the employer's requirement to be
 
05:55:23.910 --> 05:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated further the bill before you
 
05:55:26.470 --> 05:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
is not specific to back to covet as i
 
05:55:28.310 --> 05:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned and that which causes
 
05:55:31.030 --> 05:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
additional concerns and confusions for
 
05:55:33.430 --> 05:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
employers due to the open end nature of
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
such a bill we also made note that we
 
05:55:37.910 --> 05:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
thought we think this bill
 
05:55:40.788 --> 05:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a fiscal note and should um
 
05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
so that i think a number of you have
 
05:55:45.670 --> 05:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
already identified that in addition um
 
05:55:47.430 --> 05:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it would raise employer
 
05:55:51.350 --> 05:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
taxes which is also really
 
05:55:53.430 --> 05:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
troubling we're opposed to this bill and
 
05:55:55.430 --> 05:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
we encourage this um the committee to
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
find it an expedient to legislate thank
 
05:56:00.150 --> 05:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
you and i appreciate the time
 
05:56:01.750 --> 05:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
05:56:02.948 --> 05:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:08.708 --> 05:56:08.718 align:start position:0%

05:56:21.910 --> 05:56:21.920 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you committee chair

thank you committee members um
 
05:56:28.310 --> 05:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
i want to start by
 
05:56:30.548 --> 05:56:30.558 align:start position:0%
letting you all know that the sponsor of
 
05:56:32.708 --> 05:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
this bill was speaking of me
 
05:56:35.270 --> 05:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
and um i just i'm going to keep it
 
05:56:37.510 --> 05:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
really short i just wanted to let you
 
05:56:39.590 --> 05:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
folks know if you have any questions for
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
me directly i am more than willing to
 
05:56:44.310 --> 05:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
open to take questions the only thing i
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
want to point out is
 
05:56:50.230 --> 05:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
the last uh speaker mentioned that the
 
05:56:52.948 --> 05:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
cdc ingredients or the ingredients for
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
all three of the vaccines are on the cdc
 
05:56:55.200 --> 05:56:56.230 align:start position:0%
all three of the vaccines are on the cdc
website

05:56:56.230 --> 05:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
website
 
05:56:59.110 --> 05:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
um that is a partial truth
 
05:57:01.430 --> 05:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
what is on the cdc website is the list
 
05:57:03.910 --> 05:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
of active ingredients what is not on
 
05:57:06.070 --> 05:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
there is the full list of inactive
 
05:57:06.080 --> 05:57:07.830 align:start position:0%
there is the full list of inactive
ingredients

05:57:07.830 --> 05:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
ingredients
 
05:57:07.840 --> 05:57:09.030 align:start position:0%
ingredients
and

05:57:09.030 --> 05:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:11.110 --> 05:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
my allergy that they
 
05:57:15.030 --> 05:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
that they determined was with regards to
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
an inactive ingredient that's found in a
 
05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
lot of vaccines
 
05:57:21.910 --> 05:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
so that's it and i'll take any questions
 
05:57:24.470 --> 05:57:24.480 align:start position:0%

contractors of new hampshire
 
06:00:38.070 --> 06:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
i come to you today in opposition to
 
06:00:41.110 --> 06:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1538.
 
06:00:43.030 --> 06:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
i will be right up front with you i was
 
06:00:45.030 --> 06:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
hoping to hear from the sponsor the
 
06:00:48.150 --> 06:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
reason why this bill was put in
 
06:00:50.230 --> 06:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
in the sense of
 
06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
what problems have we had that would
 
06:00:54.948 --> 06:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
equate the necessity
 
06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
of having this being put in for the
 
06:01:01.030 --> 06:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
legislation but not able to have that
 
06:01:02.948 --> 06:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
i'm going to tell you
 
06:01:06.230 --> 06:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
i was involved this was a law
 
06:01:09.110 --> 06:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
prior to 1985 in the state of new
 
06:01:09.120 --> 06:01:10.310 align:start position:0%
prior to 1985 in the state of new
hampshire

06:01:10.310 --> 06:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:01:13.430 --> 06:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
and it was repealed by the legislature
 
06:01:16.390 --> 06:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line for that repeal was
 
06:01:18.788 --> 06:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
the increase in costs
 
06:01:20.948 --> 06:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
for construction projects
 
06:01:23.990 --> 06:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
the lar applied to municipalities so
 
06:01:26.310 --> 06:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
school building projects were affected
 
06:01:29.110 --> 06:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
so legislators looked at
 
06:01:31.030 --> 06:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
we don't need this extra cost we had a
 
06:01:34.390 --> 06:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
project that was a million dollars more
 
06:01:36.948 --> 06:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
when you added this kind of legislation
 
06:01:41.270 --> 06:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
onto it mandating increased labor costs
 
06:01:44.470 --> 06:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's what the davis bacon act does
 
06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
it's a prevailing wage rate and a lot of
 
06:01:48.150 --> 06:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
people don't understand it so today i'm
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
going to try to
 
06:01:52.150 --> 06:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
give you my short version of 30 years of
 
06:01:54.788 --> 06:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
seeing this type of bill before
 
06:01:56.150 --> 06:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
think of it this way you have a
 
06:01:58.708 --> 06:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
classification and i'm just going to say
 
06:02:01.590 --> 06:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
carpenter or clerk or whatever and you
 
06:02:02.788 --> 06:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
pay people
 
06:02:04.948 --> 06:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars an hour thirty dollars an
 
06:02:07.350 --> 06:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
hour and forty dollars an hour
 
06:02:09.510 --> 06:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
how the davis bacon system works they do
 
06:02:10.788 --> 06:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
a survey
 
06:02:12.548 --> 06:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
and they take everybody with that same
 
06:02:15.670 --> 06:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
classification with say it's a clerk
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
what they do is they average it so say
 
06:02:18.948 --> 06:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
you had equal numbers of people in all
 
06:02:21.670 --> 06:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
of those categories the prevailing wage
 
06:02:24.548 --> 06:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
rate would be 30 dollars everybody
 
06:02:27.270 --> 06:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
getting paid 20 now gets paid 30 as a
 
06:02:27.280 --> 06:02:28.548 align:start position:0%
getting paid 20 now gets paid 30 as a
minimum

06:02:28.548 --> 06:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
06:02:31.750 --> 06:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
the 40 are still going to get paid 40.
 
06:02:34.708 --> 06:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
you can see after 40 years of this act
 
06:02:36.788 --> 06:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
every time they do a survey
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
the minimum was the last survey
 
06:02:42.470 --> 06:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
so it continues to inflate
 
06:02:44.868 --> 06:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
the amount of money it doesn't really go
 
06:02:46.310 --> 06:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
by skill
 
06:02:48.868 --> 06:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
it's the classification
 
06:02:51.510 --> 06:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
i have made recommendations to the
 
06:02:53.270 --> 06:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
federal legislation
 
06:02:55.030 --> 06:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
to try to make it work for new hampshire
 
06:02:57.030 --> 06:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
another big issue for new hampshire is
 
06:02:59.590 --> 06:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough projects
 
06:03:03.110 --> 06:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
in each county to set a rate
 
06:03:06.390 --> 06:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
i think the fiscal note is way off i
 
06:03:07.990 --> 06:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
don't think the department of labor has
 
06:03:10.628 --> 06:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
any idea of how many classifications are
 
06:03:13.270 --> 06:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
not going to be already have a wage rate
 
06:03:14.708 --> 06:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
they're going to be swamped so how do
 
06:03:14.718 --> 06:03:15.430 align:start position:0%
they're going to be swamped so how do
they

06:03:15.430 --> 06:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:03:17.830 --> 06:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
pick a wage rate when i have
 
06:03:19.190 --> 06:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
06:03:20.948 --> 06:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
i'll pick one that is in the current
 
06:03:22.548 --> 06:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
federal program
 
06:03:23.750 --> 06:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
guard rail
 
06:03:26.310 --> 06:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
we have maybe three guard rail companies
 
06:03:27.670 --> 06:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
06:03:29.990 --> 06:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
if one company during the survey period
 
06:03:31.990 --> 06:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
works in one county
 
06:03:33.910 --> 06:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
they can't use that one company that's
 
06:03:35.350 --> 06:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
not an average they have to have more
 
06:03:38.230 --> 06:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
than one company to do the survey
 
06:03:40.628 --> 06:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
so it comes out blank
 
06:03:42.628 --> 06:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
so under this bill it goes to the
 
06:03:44.150 --> 06:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
department of labor and they have to
 
06:03:45.830 --> 06:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
come up with a wage rate
 
06:03:48.788 --> 06:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
there's no procedures and there's no
 
06:03:51.190 --> 06:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
right now if that were to happen
 
06:03:52.948 --> 06:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
it goes to the federal government under
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
a whole process
 
06:03:56.390 --> 06:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
which i can tell you contractors don't
 
06:03:57.670 --> 06:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
like and they don't know what they're
 
06:03:58.788 --> 06:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
06:04:00.070 --> 06:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
for a wage rate because they're going to
 
06:04:02.150 --> 06:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
look at surrounding counties and
 
06:04:05.190 --> 06:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
surrounding counties maybe massachusetts
 
06:04:06.948 --> 06:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
and suddenly the rate could come back
 
06:04:09.910 --> 06:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
nowhere near what they're paying
 
06:04:11.750 --> 06:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't mean they accept what
 
06:04:14.070 --> 06:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
they've been paying in that county
 
06:04:17.510 --> 06:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
on private jobs this is a big one
 
06:04:17.520 --> 06:04:19.030 align:start position:0%
on private jobs this is a big one
so

06:04:19.030 --> 06:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:21.590 --> 06:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
what i want you to get is this will add
 
06:04:24.150 --> 06:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
cost even though this excludes schools
 
06:04:25.590 --> 06:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
won't affect schools because it's been
 
06:04:25.600 --> 06:04:27.110 align:start position:0%
won't affect schools because it's been
excluded

06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
06:04:28.390 --> 06:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
which is great
 
06:04:31.030 --> 06:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
but i think it's going to impact stake
 
06:04:33.750 --> 06:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
projects the same way
 
06:04:33.760 --> 06:04:34.788 align:start position:0%
projects the same way
so

06:04:34.788 --> 06:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
you know i proposed i'm going to just
 
06:04:38.868 --> 06:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
give you some my
 
06:04:41.110 --> 06:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
wage rates shouldn't be just determined
 
06:04:42.948 --> 06:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
the prevailing wage rate i think what
 
06:04:45.190 --> 06:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
most legislators are looking for
 
06:04:47.830 --> 06:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
is a minimum wage on a craft if you were
 
06:04:49.990 --> 06:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
to do this for construction
 
06:04:52.230 --> 06:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
but i've heard no problem with how much
 
06:04:54.548 --> 06:04:54.558 align:start position:0%
contractors are already paying
 
06:04:56.470 --> 06:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
and if you know the shortage and help
 
06:04:58.470 --> 06:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
that we're currently having the biggest
 
06:05:00.230 --> 06:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
weak problem we have is employees going
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
to whatever company pays the most that's
 
06:05:04.470 --> 06:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
what's happening at the moment
 
06:05:07.430 --> 06:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
so you have to understand that
 
06:05:10.150 --> 06:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm highlighting this problem
 
06:05:12.310 --> 06:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
the first thing i would say on this bill
 
06:05:14.548 --> 06:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
don't adopt the federal
 
06:05:17.270 --> 06:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh davis-bacon regulations
 
06:05:18.788 --> 06:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
they haven't changed they only changed
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
it once since it was first put in place
 
06:05:24.310 --> 06:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
they added fringe benefits that's it
 
06:05:27.110 --> 06:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
to tell me a law that they enacted 50
 
06:05:28.708 --> 06:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
06:05:30.788 --> 06:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
works in today's environment i'm going
 
06:05:31.750 --> 06:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
to tell you
 
06:05:33.430 --> 06:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work for new hampshire maybe
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
it works for some big cities like
 
06:05:37.270 --> 06:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
philadelphia but it doesn't work in the
 
06:05:38.708 --> 06:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
little state of new hampshire we just
 
06:05:40.948 --> 06:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
don't have that many projects that would
 
06:05:40.958 --> 06:05:44.708 align:start position:0%
don't have that many projects that would
qualify

06:05:44.708 --> 06:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:47.590 --> 06:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
the other the other big issue
 
06:05:49.990 --> 06:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
i get involved with the surveys
 
06:05:51.830 --> 06:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
i'm encouraging contractors to fill out
 
06:05:54.150 --> 06:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
the survey so we don't have wage rates
 
06:05:55.670 --> 06:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
that come out through the davis bacon
 
06:05:57.430 --> 06:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
that are way off
 
06:05:57.440 --> 06:05:58.948 align:start position:0%
that are way off
and

06:05:58.948 --> 06:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:05:59.910 --> 06:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
they have
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
so you have to understand they do it
 
06:06:03.350 --> 06:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
every two three years they go around to
 
06:06:05.350 --> 06:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
the different like they'll do building
 
06:06:07.030 --> 06:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
and then they'll do highway they'll do
 
06:06:07.040 --> 06:06:08.548 align:start position:0%
and then they'll do highway they'll do
heavy

06:06:08.548 --> 06:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
heavy
 
06:06:10.230 --> 06:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's different classifications and
 
06:06:13.590 --> 06:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
they do surveys in the state
 
06:06:15.190 --> 06:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
let me just tell you the one that's up
 
06:06:17.270 --> 06:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:06:21.030 --> 06:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
highway they surveyed
 
06:06:24.150 --> 06:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the cutoff date was 2019.
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
they surveyed wage rates from november
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
of 2017
 
06:06:32.948 --> 06:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
to 10 31 2018. so a year
 
06:06:32.958 --> 06:06:34.708 align:start position:0%
to 10 31 2018. so a year
1718.

06:06:34.708 --> 06:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
1718.
 
06:06:37.590 --> 06:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
they're still in the verification mode
 
06:06:39.430 --> 06:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
do you think those rates are going to be
 
06:06:41.030 --> 06:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
anything compared to what we just went
 
06:06:43.350 --> 06:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
through this past year with inflation
 
06:06:44.948 --> 06:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
and employee costs
 
06:06:44.958 --> 06:06:46.390 align:start position:0%
and employee costs
so

06:06:46.390 --> 06:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:06:48.070 --> 06:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the thing i also want to
 
06:06:48.080 --> 06:06:49.030 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the thing i also want to
explain

06:06:49.030 --> 06:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
explain
 
06:06:51.270 --> 06:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
in some categories i've seen things like
 
06:06:52.948 --> 06:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
a classification in my 30 years i've
 
06:06:55.590 --> 06:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
never seen an oiler came up as a
 
06:06:55.600 --> 06:06:57.270 align:start position:0%
never seen an oiler came up as a
classification

06:06:57.270 --> 06:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
classification
 
06:06:59.270 --> 06:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
i don't remember an oiler ever being a
 
06:07:03.190 --> 06:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
classification it was 85 bucks an hour
 
06:07:04.948 --> 06:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
so i don't know who that is and who was
 
06:07:06.070 --> 06:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
getting that
 
06:07:08.150 --> 06:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
but somehow through this davis baking
 
06:07:10.788 --> 06:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
process that came out as a wager
 
06:07:14.310 --> 06:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
or we've had cases where a skill
 
06:07:16.310 --> 06:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
like pipe layer is less than another
 
06:07:18.628 --> 06:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
classification and there oh we had this
 
06:07:21.990 --> 06:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
one a pipe layer was paid less than the
 
06:07:23.910 --> 06:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
roller operator
 
06:07:25.350 --> 06:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
guess what pipe layers want to do they
 
06:07:26.948 --> 06:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
want to ride the roller
 
06:07:29.270 --> 06:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
it clearly skill wise the pipe layer was
 
06:07:32.070 --> 06:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
a much more expensive job but the rates
 
06:07:33.190 --> 06:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
came out
 
06:07:33.200 --> 06:07:34.708 align:start position:0%
came out
different

06:07:34.708 --> 06:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:07:37.990 --> 06:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
try correcting a rate of tried
 
06:07:39.750 --> 06:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's next to impossible through the
 
06:07:41.830 --> 06:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
federal highways through the federal
 
06:07:44.868 --> 06:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
davis bacon department of labor
 
06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
they have their rules you really can't
 
06:07:48.548 --> 06:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
change them this is what they've done
 
06:07:49.750 --> 06:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
for years
 
06:07:52.070 --> 06:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
so i really plead with you that this has
 
06:07:54.868 --> 06:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
bill has come up since 1985 multiple
 
06:07:57.830 --> 06:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
times and it hasn't made it into law
 
06:08:00.470 --> 06:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i think cost is one thing and i'd
 
06:08:02.310 --> 06:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
like to hear
 
06:08:04.150 --> 06:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know who's not getting paid enough
 
06:08:06.548 --> 06:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
in construction because
 
06:08:07.990 --> 06:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
i've got companies that tell me if i
 
06:08:09.510 --> 06:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
come to work for them for any one of
 
06:08:11.430 --> 06:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
those trades i'm getting 25 bucks or
 
06:08:13.670 --> 06:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
more per hour
 
06:08:16.470 --> 06:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
in this economy so i'm looking for
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
why we need this if we do need something
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
my doors are open for our state but i
 
06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
think under the fiscal note it's going
 
06:08:26.548 --> 06:08:26.558 align:start position:0%
to cost the labor department more i
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
think the fiscal note should address
 
06:08:30.390 --> 06:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
what the cost of construction projects
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
will be for the state
 
06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
have you ever gone to the government
 
06:08:35.430 --> 06:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
council with a construction project that
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
was 10 over budget
 
06:08:40.070 --> 06:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're in trouble if you're the state
 
06:08:40.080 --> 06:08:41.510 align:start position:0%
you're in trouble if you're the state
agency

06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
agency
 
06:08:43.830 --> 06:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
what's it going to cost state agencies
 
06:08:47.030 --> 06:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
to collect payrolls review them and make
 
06:08:49.430 --> 06:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
sure everything's in compliance there's
 
06:08:53.270 --> 06:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of costs to do this system
 
06:08:55.590 --> 06:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
so i bring that up to you
 
06:08:57.350 --> 06:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
06:08:59.670 --> 06:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
not many of us are
 
06:09:01.910 --> 06:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
here in the i didn't expect to have reps
 
06:09:04.150 --> 06:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
all by myself but
 
06:09:06.070 --> 06:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the committees
 
06:09:08.830 --> 06:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
glad to work with a subcommittee a
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
committee what we're trying to address
 
06:09:14.708 --> 06:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
and the best way to do it because
 
06:09:16.150 --> 06:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
i just don't know what the problem is
 
06:09:17.910 --> 06:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
for this bill this year
 
06:09:20.470 --> 06:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i would end my testimony and hope
 
06:09:23.270 --> 06:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
the committee votes itl
 
06:09:24.708 --> 06:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
06:09:26.470 --> 06:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative abalani followed by
 
06:09:28.230 --> 06:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
06:09:29.510 --> 06:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:09:31.750 --> 06:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
taking the question um there is no
 
06:09:33.590 --> 06:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note from the department of labor
 
06:09:35.350 --> 06:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
sorry charlino i'm sorry i just can't
 
06:09:37.270 --> 06:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
hear you uh there's no fiscal note from
 
06:09:39.190 --> 06:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
the department of labor
 
06:09:41.910 --> 06:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's only for administrative services
 
06:09:43.750 --> 06:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
oh that's correct the administrative
 
06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
services of the number of people they
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
may need
 
06:09:48.788 --> 06:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
but i guess i was looking at how the
 
06:09:50.708 --> 06:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
bill is drafted as
 
06:09:53.430 --> 06:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
projects of public works so i'm not sure
 
06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
if des's projects is
 
06:09:57.750 --> 06:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
department safety projects which all run
 
06:09:59.910 --> 06:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
through administrative services but
 
06:10:02.310 --> 06:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
they're controlled by those agencies
 
06:10:04.070 --> 06:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know what are those costs that would
 
06:10:06.628 --> 06:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
be in place i also
 
06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
i agree with you
 
06:10:10.070 --> 06:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
at first i looked at it to see what the
 
06:10:12.310 --> 06:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
municipal association was going to put
 
06:10:12.320 --> 06:10:13.030 align:start position:0%
municipal association was going to put
in

06:10:13.030 --> 06:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:10:15.190 --> 06:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note and i get it they didn't
 
06:10:17.750 --> 06:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
put anything as their example
 
06:10:19.270 --> 06:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman welcome
 
06:10:20.868 --> 06:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
06:10:22.390 --> 06:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:10:23.990 --> 06:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
06:10:27.270 --> 06:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
my question is to ask if you can fill in
 
06:10:29.670 --> 06:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
something i seem to remember from
 
06:10:29.680 --> 06:10:31.270 align:start position:0%
something i seem to remember from
earlier

06:10:31.270 --> 06:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:10:34.548 --> 06:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
discussions in this area you mentioned
 
06:10:36.310 --> 06:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
a big problem in new hampshire is where
 
06:10:37.510 --> 06:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
small state
 
06:10:39.990 --> 06:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative projects are thin on the
 
06:10:40.000 --> 06:10:41.270 align:start position:0%
representative projects are thin on the
ground

06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
ground
 
06:10:43.830 --> 06:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
and doesn't provide data i also seem to
 
06:10:46.230 --> 06:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
recall that these participating in the
 
06:10:50.230 --> 06:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
survey is voluntary so you can have
 
06:10:52.628 --> 06:10:52.638 align:start position:0%
very few of the participants actually
 
06:10:54.628 --> 06:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
turn in the data
 
06:10:54.638 --> 06:10:56.230 align:start position:0%
turn in the data
and

06:10:56.230 --> 06:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:58.708 --> 06:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
those that do may have
 
06:11:01.350 --> 06:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
a particular agenda
 
06:11:04.150 --> 06:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
so you get data that's naturally skewed
 
06:11:06.548 --> 06:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
by the people submitting the surveys
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
right when we encourage people to submit
 
06:11:08.638 --> 06:11:09.510 align:start position:0%
right when we encourage people to submit
data

06:11:09.510 --> 06:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
data
 
06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
we're hoping for the private sector to
 
06:11:13.590 --> 06:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
submit data but what is the incentive
 
06:11:15.830 --> 06:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
for them to do it there's a lot of
 
06:11:17.750 --> 06:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork involved in setting your
 
06:11:19.990 --> 06:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
classification filling out these forms i
 
06:11:21.910 --> 06:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
could bring them in for you
 
06:11:24.230 --> 06:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
then the labor department the federal
 
06:11:25.830 --> 06:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
labor department calls you up and wants
 
06:11:27.270 --> 06:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
to verify
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
all of this information so right now
 
06:11:31.110 --> 06:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
they're calling my contractors and
 
06:11:32.590 --> 06:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
trying to verify
 
06:11:35.190 --> 06:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
2017 data
 
06:11:38.070 --> 06:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at it going
 
06:11:40.150 --> 06:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
the rates back then now have no
 
06:11:40.160 --> 06:11:41.510 align:start position:0%
the rates back then now have no
correlation

06:11:41.510 --> 06:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
correlation
 
06:11:43.430 --> 06:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
and they only survey every three years
 
06:11:45.190 --> 06:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
so the stuff's behind but you're
 
06:11:46.470 --> 06:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct
 
06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
the only ones that benefits are the ones
 
06:11:51.030 --> 06:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
that are in the system that already have
 
06:11:53.830 --> 06:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
the rate if they're too high
 
06:11:55.830 --> 06:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
and so the agenda is for the high ones
 
06:11:59.430 --> 06:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
to come in but i think there is a
 
06:12:02.070 --> 06:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
i understand the philosophy but this
 
06:12:04.788 --> 06:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
bill attaching it to a system that has
 
06:12:07.590 --> 06:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
been problematic for new hampshire just
 
06:12:09.110 --> 06:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
is the wrong thing to do if you wanted
 
06:12:11.270 --> 06:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
to set up a system you might have to
 
06:12:12.868 --> 06:12:12.878 align:start position:0%
have a division of the department of
 
06:12:15.510 --> 06:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
labor and have a way for them to do
 
06:12:17.990 --> 06:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
surveys or set rates and you would have
 
06:12:20.628 --> 06:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
to figure out what's a fair formula
 
06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
i think this process is just not the
 
06:12:25.590 --> 06:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
correct for today but you're right
 
06:12:26.868 --> 06:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
even the contractors that are
 
06:12:28.948 --> 06:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
participating it's not necessarily that
 
06:12:30.948 --> 06:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
they have an agenda but
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're stuck with whatever comes out
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
and how to deal with it for the next
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
three years and so they don't want to do
 
06:12:39.670 --> 06:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:42.788 --> 06:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
any other questions for mr abbott
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much there's
 
06:12:46.310 --> 06:12:46.320 align:start position:0%

you okay
 
06:13:54.230 --> 06:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
also please check your emails there are
 
06:13:58.070 --> 06:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
some bills we will be exacting next week
 
06:14:00.868 --> 06:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
we will be executing after
 
06:14:02.830 --> 06:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
we're done with our
 
06:14:05.670 --> 06:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
our bills for the day
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
and there will be some amendments on
 
06:14:11.110 --> 06:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
some of those so please be ready to um
 
06:14:12.788 --> 06:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
you know we've read them read them have
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
possibly to the sponsor of the
 
06:14:20.708 --> 06:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
amendments beforehand representative
 
06:14:20.718 --> 06:14:25.110 align:start position:0%
amendments beforehand representative
sullivan

06:14:25.110 --> 06:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:27.590 --> 06:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering if it might make
 
06:14:29.910 --> 06:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
sense if we had downtime during the day
 
06:14:31.590 --> 06:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
if we knew what bills were going to be
 
06:14:31.600 --> 06:14:32.628 align:start position:0%
if we knew what bills were going to be
exact

06:14:32.628 --> 06:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
exact
 
06:14:34.390 --> 06:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
if we could save some time at the end of
 
06:14:36.708 --> 06:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
the day by executing some of the bills
 
06:14:44.948 --> 06:14:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:48.868 --> 06:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:51.030 --> 06:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
you would like to know the bill numbers
 
06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
so you can execute them possibly in
 
06:14:55.030 --> 06:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
between bills if we have time is that
 
06:14:55.990 --> 06:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
what you're asking representative
 
06:14:56.000 --> 06:14:57.190 align:start position:0%
what you're asking representative
sullivan

06:14:57.190 --> 06:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
sullivan
 
06:14:59.190 --> 06:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
well you've given us a list
 
06:15:00.470 --> 06:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:15:03.590 --> 06:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
it just seems if we had one of those
 
06:15:07.110 --> 06:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
half hour down times we could uh take up
 
06:15:08.548 --> 06:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
one of the execs that we were
 
06:15:10.150 --> 06:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
anticipating taking up at the end of the
 
06:15:12.310 --> 06:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
day it might just move us along that's
 
06:15:12.320 --> 06:15:13.190 align:start position:0%
day it might just move us along that's
all

06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:15:14.948 --> 06:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
that's fine um
 
06:15:16.390 --> 06:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
as long as you're not cramming things in
 
06:15:17.510 --> 06:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
there because i don't want to have a
 
06:15:19.110 --> 06:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
half an hour period and have a piece of
 
06:15:20.788 --> 06:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
legislation where there's going to be a
 
06:15:22.788 --> 06:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
lot of debate on it so we'll take it as
 
06:15:24.628 --> 06:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
we can i have no problem doing that as
 
06:15:26.868 --> 06:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
long as everyone is going to be prepared
 
06:15:30.150 --> 06:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
should one of those things come up
 
06:15:30.160 --> 06:15:33.430 align:start position:0%
should one of those things come up
representative

06:15:33.430 --> 06:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:34.628 --> 06:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for volunteering for that
 
06:15:36.310 --> 06:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
subject meeting are there any other
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
questions that will be left up to
 
06:15:40.548 --> 06:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
representative terracott to
 
06:15:42.948 --> 06:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
schedule a meeting
 
06:15:46.390 --> 06:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions to the chair
 
06:15:47.830 --> 06:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your diligence
 
06:15:50.788 --> 06:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
today and we have a couple more uh
 
06:15:53.110 --> 06:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
longer ones coming up
 
06:15:55.350 --> 06:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
longer days i would like to get have us
 
06:15:58.628 --> 06:15:58.638 align:start position:0%
all be done in three weeks possibly
 
06:16:01.190 --> 06:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
we do have to definitely exact a few
 
06:16:03.430 --> 06:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
bills next week because they are
 
06:16:06.868 --> 06:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
financial uh bills that have to go to
 
06:16:09.030 --> 06:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
06:16:09.040 --> 06:16:11.670 align:start position:0%
another committee
so

06:16:11.670 --> 06:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:12.708 --> 06:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
