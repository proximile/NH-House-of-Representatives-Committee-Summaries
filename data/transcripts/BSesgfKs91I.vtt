00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
clock orientation has not yet begun it
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
is simply because I'm waiting for
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
members to show up because the
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
information I want to pass
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
along is information that the members
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
should be here
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
to absorb
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
so we're going to wait until we get a
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
little bit better attendance that means
 
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
our first public hearing will probably
 
00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.030 align:start position:0%
our first public hearing will probably
be

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
delayed but uh such is life it's the
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
beginning of a new session year so it's
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
always a bit of a rocky start we'll get
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.120 --> 00:12:13.189 align:start position:0%
 
can

00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%

heard today during today's public
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
hearings and then at 2 o'clock tomorrow
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon we will have an executive
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
session on the five bills that we will
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
so that is our plan for the next couple
 
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:33.550 align:start position:0%
so that is our plan for the next couple
of

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:36.519 align:start position:0%
days we have 20 bills assigned to our
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
committee this
 
00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
year representative Doug Thomas and I
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
have worked out a tenative schedule that
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
sees us complete our work on all of
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
these bills in early
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
February five of the 20 bills are early
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
bills that must be done by the 15th of
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
February anyway but it is is our hope
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
get the majority of these bills done by
 
00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:06.519 align:start position:0%
early February not just the early
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
bills why do we want to push them
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
through so
 
00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:13.959 align:start position:0%
quickly the house Speaker has determined
 
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759 align:start position:0%
that it is in the best interest of the
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
house for all of us to meet as often as
 
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
we can on
 
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
Thursdays this session year rather than
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
stacking up hundreds of bills to be
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
in three Marathon house sessions in the
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
middle of
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
March the house Speaker would like to
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
have regular Thursday sessions either
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
all day sessions or possibly even
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
halfday sessions with afternoon sessions
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
on a Thursday afternoon that would leave
 
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
time for committee work on a Thursday
 
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
morning well the only way that's going
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
to happen is if those of us who serve on
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
policy committees crank out bills so
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
that they can be brought to the house
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
floor on a weekly
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
basis so we're going to do our part
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to get through our
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
bills and get them to the house floor
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
promptly so that the speaker can hold
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
these weekly house
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
sessions and we don't have to go through
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
this business of marathon sessions in
 
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
the middle of
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
March I don't know how many of you are
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
Ware of it but I've been here for this
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
is my 10th year in the legislature and
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple of marches where we
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
were in reps Hall until 3 or 4:00 in the
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
morning and that was not fun nor was it
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
policy yes we had to stop the clock
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
because midnight was a deadline and we
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
weren't done so we stopped the clock and
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
kept going until 4:00 in the
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
morning so we try we're trying to avoid
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
that kind of situation for this coming
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
year and as all of you are no doubt
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
aware by now we have something like 815
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
bills that have been submitted this year
 
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
so it's a heavy
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
workload we were lucky we only got 20 uh
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
but we have to do our part to help the
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
rest of the house get through this heavy
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
workload of 800 bills and so we will
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
crank ours out as quickly as we can uh
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington remember you
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
have to ask for permission to speak I
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
have a question yes go ahead uh are you
 
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
going to share the the schedule you and
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
Doug worked out so we'll know in advance
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
so we can plan well it's not completely
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
worked out um but yes we will share it
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
okay so that is our plan going forward
 
00:17:55.799 --> 00:17:57.390 align:start position:0%
okay so that is our plan going forward
for

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.310 align:start position:0%
for
2024

00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
couple of other announcements that you
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
should be aware of in the office just
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
off to our left here there is a stack of
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
copies of the 10-year State energy
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
strategy you are welcome to take a copy
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
if you don't already have
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
one question representative
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
nter um when was that put together is it
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
new or is it 10 years from next eight
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
or I think it's the 2021
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
version yes 2021 version thank you
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right so 10-year energy
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
strategy copies are
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
there each of you has received a folder
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
that contains bills for the coming
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
year it is unfortunately not complete
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
there were three bills that uh Os or not
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
OS but U house administrative Services
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
has not had a chance to finish printing
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
yet so there are three
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
bills that are assigned to us that are
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
not yet copied and in your folder I
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.590 align:start position:0%
think it's
1700

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
1700
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
1697 and 1627 I believe are the three
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
that didn't make it but anyway this is
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
the only copy of the bills that you are
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
going to receive this year so I urge
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
each of you to take good care of these
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
copies consider potentially getting a
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
three- ring binder and putting all your
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
bills in the three- ring binder if you
 
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
haven't already done
 
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.270 align:start position:0%
haven't already done
so

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh and take good care of these copies of
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
the bills because these are the only
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
ones you're going to get of course you
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
can print your own copy but uh whenever
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
you want but
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
as far as house committee uh Services is
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
concerned this is the only copy you're
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.549 align:start position:0%
 
year

00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
so next I want to remind everybody since
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
we're about to embark on public hearings
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
I want to remind everybody about the
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
hearings first of
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
all during a committee session if you
 
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
want to speak you have to be recognized
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
chair several times last year we had
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
people just spontaneously speak and that
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
interrupts the flow of activity for the
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
committee and can be confusing to people
 
00:20:47.149 --> 00:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
who are watching at home so please if
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
you want to speak raise your hand raise
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
it high so you can catch my attention
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
and I will recognize you to
 
00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
speak but you have to to be you have to
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
wait until you recognized to speak to
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
avoid collisions and chaos and clutter
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
mind now public hearings are here for us
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
on the committee to understand the bills
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
being presented to
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
us it is our job therefore to ask
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
questions of the people who are
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
describing the
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
bill we're not here to debate the bill
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves or with the people who
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
are explaining it to us we are simply
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
here to ask questions and gather
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
information now if you have a question
 
00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
to ask you raise your hand I'll
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
recognize you and you can ask the
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
question I will permit one follow-up
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
if after everyone else on the committee
 
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
who wants to ask a question has asked a
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
question and you want to ask a second
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
question I will permit
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
it but in your first round of
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
questions and I Ur urge you all to
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
remember that we treat everybody here
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
equally we treat people with
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
respect we maintain house decorum at all
 
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
times and if we have any difficulty with
 
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.310 align:start position:0%
times and if we have any difficulty with
someone

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
who's presenting information or somebody
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
who's sitting in the
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
back watching the display of
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
information we
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
will call a
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
break to deal with an unruly situation
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
if it should develop and we might even
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
involve house security officials if it's
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
necessary hopefully that won't be
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
necessary we've been pretty lucky up to
 
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.310 align:start position:0%
necessary we've been pretty lucky up to
this

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
point so is everybody clear now
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
on how we're going to conduct our public
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
hearings anybody have any
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman happy New
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
Year um the question that I have is
 
00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
around amendments um last year we had
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
someone come to present a bill where
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
they brought along an amendment that had
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
been made since the Inception of the
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
bill and they were prohibited from
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
presenting that Amendment but I have
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
seen even members of this committee go
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
to Second committee and and bring an
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
amendment along with the bill and
 
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
present it at that time so I wanted to
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
ask how we are going to be um handling
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
amendments since they're kind of our
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
bread and butter that people often find
 
00:23:58.269 --> 00:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
something wrong with the bill before
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
they bring it to the
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee excellent question so the way
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
you handle that situation is during
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
public testimony on the bill it is
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
proper to
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
discuss changes that you intend to make
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
to the bill via an amendment it is not
 
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
proper to submit the amendment the am
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment can only be submitted
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
during executive session but you can
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
discuss during testimony
 
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
the changes you plan to make and for to
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
give you a good example this afternoon
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
when I introduced House Bill
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
1398 I'm going to discuss a couple of
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
changes that I plan to make to the bill
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
before uh with an amendment before it
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
goes forward now we're executing that
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
bill tomorrow so my Amendment will be
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
ready tomorrow followup yes followup
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
followup would be related to that so
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
that will there also o be a work session
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh where we will be able to be familiar
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
with the amendment before we have to
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
vote on yes that's why I scheduled work
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
sessions before tomorrow's exec session
 
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:13.640 align:start position:0%

work session appears before the
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
the uh Amendment will be discussed fully
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%

00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
findings can guide strategies to

this is the last one public trust and

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee serves as a proactive measure
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
to assess and enhance the impact of

access to electronic devices this
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
approach aligns with principles of
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
inclusivity Equitable access to
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:00.279 align:start position:0%

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
was just wondering if there's any
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
evidence that these agencies are not
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
communicating I I don't think it's a
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
matter of an agency not doing their job
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any compiled
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
report that's available anywhere that
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
information further questions
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you um it's
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
sort of along the same lines
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
um uh the question always would be well
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
my first question would be why a
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
Communications bill comes to this
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee but my second
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
question uh would be uh around
 
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
um that evidence question of whether
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
whether there's been difficulty reaching
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
people I know we all passed an emergency
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
bill when all the electric rates went up
 
00:32:09.789 --> 00:32:09.799 align:start position:0%
and then we heard reports the following
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
spring uh that a very small portion had
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
actually been delivered to people and it
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
may actually be a result of this very
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
this very thing so we do have a specific
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
example to the representative's question
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh in our committee for a program that
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
we tried to Institute and it didn't
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
actually get to the people so
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
how uh how uh looking at the bill itself
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
what are the expectations in terms of
 
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
who is going to participate in this is
 
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
this just going to be a regular
 
00:32:39.629 --> 00:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
committee that's got senators and Reps
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
or um you know H how do we propose to
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
solve the problem if we do this study
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
committee right so um based on the bill
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
it it uh the committee would be um
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
comprised of the standard um the members
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
of the Senate and the house that those
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
are onlines uh
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
S8 and nine in the bill and actually and
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
so because it includes the Senate and
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
the the uh the uh the house um there's
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
there's a certain obligation that that
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
people have to to come to this committee
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
and and provide information if it's
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
requested so I think it would be uh
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
people representatives and Senators who
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
have in interest in this topic and who
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
have some sort of uh competence in this
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.639 --> 00:33:53.149 align:start position:0%
 
ask

00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
followup I'm sorry I thought I had hit
 
00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:55.950 align:start position:0%
followup I'm sorry I thought I had hit
the

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
button I'm loud to me so I had no idea
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
um so the question is around the uh
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not the expertise will live
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
on any type of subcommittee made up of
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislators to figure out who has
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
technology in their homes like I think
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
that would be hard to get at and I think
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
that's probably why our agencies have
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
had trouble reaching certain people and
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that that that's a fair
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
question or a fair objection um but
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to break through this Log
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
Jam you know the agent don't have this
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
information we need this information we
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
all know that we need the information
 
00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
not only do people not have
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
technological devices but um I I even
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
know members of the of the house that
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
have to stand in a corner of their house
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
because that's the only place where they
 
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
can get to the internet you know so we
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
need to be able to identify these people
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
somehow and this is this is just taking
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
the bull by the horns and and seeing if
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
we can do it ourselves if we can start
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
the start start the process on the
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
conversation because it needs to be
 
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
done representative
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
muns thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and happy
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
birthday um I don't I don't disagree
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
with any of the um the reasons that you
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
cited for why we
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
should do a better job of making sure
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
that the word is getting out to people I
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
guess my my question is do we need a
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
study committee to do that or could we
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
in instead
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
ask uh one of the state agencies the and
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
the two that come to mind are the
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
department of Information Technology or
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
the department of admin administrative
 
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
services to deliver a report to the
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
legislature EX on these issues I I I
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
just wonder you know what added value a
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
study committee made up of three uh
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
representatives and you know maybe a
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
senator or two will add to the um
 
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
will will will Aid in you know
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
addressing the problems I I think that's
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
a valid um observation and I actually
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
think that if we could commit to a work
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
study group here in this committee
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
because the Bill's in the committee that
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
this representative Bernardi has a
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:25.710 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
uh

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
so prior to the
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
internet we communicated by
 
00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.750 align:start position:0%
internet we communicated by
Mail

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
Mail
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
newspaper and then radio and
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
TV I am unaware of any other mechanism
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
that one could
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
use uh be outside the internet in order
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
to facilitate Communications uh and
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
those Vehicles would potentially
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
engender public meetings at different
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
times and places where people could show
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
up do you have any other ideas that uh
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
are going to facilitate broader
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
communication and are you asking the
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
this committee to develop those methods
 
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.790 align:start position:0%
this committee to develop those methods
or

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
or ask Departments of the of the state
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
to use those methods more often than
 
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.950 align:start position:0%
to use those methods more often than
they

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
do yes
 
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.910 align:start position:0%
do yes
guess

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
what yes I I believe this bill is asking
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
agencies to pursue those those Avenues
 
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
um and yes I believe this this committee
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
would would try to figure out ways to to
 
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
get the information um it's you're right
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
we all communicate with the internet I
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
haven't even turned my TV on in months
 
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
because I stream everything on my
 
00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
monitor on my and my computer at home
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
but a lot of people don't have access to
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
the technology and we're you know our
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
our our town newspapers are dying left
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
and right we have no way to sort of
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
reach these people there there are
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
Billboards there are things like that
 
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
but nothing is going to reach these
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
people like the internet so if they
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
don't have access to these these
 
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
electronic devices or the internet how
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
are we going to reach them and that's
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's the question that this committee
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
is charged
 
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
with representative Harrington has a
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you for taking
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
my question um my question is what what
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
is not in the bill I've read through
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
this a few times and what I don't see
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
and what I'm assuming is a long-term
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
goal and I'm trying to uh see if you
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
agree with this um is that the goal here
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
is taxpayer subsidized access to the
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
internet is that the goal of this uh
 
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal of this
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
committee no
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
how would you can I follow up follow up
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
how would you envision that when they do
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
all this study uh how is anything going
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
to happen where's the money going to
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
come from well I think that that's part
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
of the the the responsibility of the
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee is to figure out if if there a
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
solution costs money where the money is
 
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.550 align:start position:0%
solution costs money where the money is
coming

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
from well I think we know where that's
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
coming from representative Doug Thomas
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
have no doubt that you're interested in
 
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
some of this
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
information and perhaps there are some
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
people out there they don't have the the
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
internet we we know but um I'm just
 
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
curious did have you heard from any of
 
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
the state agencies that would be
 
00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
supplying these this information as to
 
00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
their concern that their information
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
isn't getting out what what surveys or
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
what reports are out there that would
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
indicate that we have an issue with this
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
that needs to be worked done I'm just
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
curious uh um you know is it just was it
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
your assumption from some of your
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
constituents that that don't get this
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
information or or where is this
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
assumption coming from that people
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
aren't getting the information that they
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
need I'm just curious what what document
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
or survey out there might be telling us
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
that we need to act on something no I
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
think it's the opposite I don't think
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
there is a report out there that that
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
identifies this and that's that's the
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
need that this committee would would
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
address follow up followup so my
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
understanding my understanding is that
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
because there is no report out there of
 
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
any issue we need to look to see if
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
there's one I I don't no that's not what
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
I said um there because there's no
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
report that identifies the extent of
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
this of this
 
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
problem um because that does not exist
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's what this committee would would
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
rectify okay representative lii has a
 
00:40:59.470 --> 00:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I'm
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
wondering what the committee might do to
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
avoid selection bias as we often see we
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
get a squeaky wheel which is some small
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
but not representative group that may be
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
um essentially um the only thing that
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
from um the the the responsibilities of
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
this committee are outlined in lines 8
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
through um
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
26 and so it would not be influenced by
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
any lobbyist or any squeaky wheel as you
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
put it um this is empirical data it's
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
collecting numbers of of residents
 
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
households that don't have electronic
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
devices or that have an
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
issue do you have a followup followup um
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the question I'm still trying to ask
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
is how would we avoid having the people
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
thus identified be uh unrepresentative
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
state I'm sorry I'm not sure I
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
understand um what you're what you're
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
asking uh whatever we do is going to be
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
focused on some small number of people I
 
00:42:25.549 --> 00:42:25.559 align:start position:0%
would think and the agencies might you
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
know e the selection selection bias is
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
the thing I'm concerned about is that U
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
we won't get a report that reflects the
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
whole of the state but only a minority
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
wheel um I selection bias um certainly
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
exists I just don't see it um existing
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
in this committee um I I appreciate your
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
concern for it um but this is this is
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
the entire um population this is not
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
just one one small group this is finding
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
Pockets yes of course you know so I I I
 
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.079 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling to
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
to appreciate the um concern that you
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
have I'm I'm just not sure I'm
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly I have to
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
move on representative PL has a question
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
question many of my concerns were
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
answered and I didn't hear this one has
 
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
any of the public or
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
residents came out do you have is there
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
out there a group or a number because
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
the US Census of 2022 show that we have
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
95% um return of New Hampshire residents
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
have computer access internet access and
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
they own a device and that's up 1.4%
 
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.069 align:start position:0%
they own a device and that's up 1.4%
since

00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:56.910 align:start position:0%
since
2020

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering is there residents
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
out there that came to these agencies
 
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
that said they did not get information
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um first of all that the 95%
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
that you quoted is that access to a
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
computer or access to a home computer so
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
are they counting Library use or School
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
use for
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
that may uh thank you that that's
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
including computers and smart devices
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
cell phones okay and I'm I'm sorry what
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
was the rest of your question
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
the how did somebody come all right um I
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
wish the prime sponsor were here because
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
he could answer that um I
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
I am not the prime sponsor so nobody
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
came to me the prime sponsor came to me
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
I agreed that this was a a good idea
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
that needed looking
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
into so I can't answer that I don't
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
know representative Noel has a
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and happy
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
birthday uh is there an implied measure
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
of what the impact and
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness that uh of of how those
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
would be measured impact and
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness would be measured as they
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
develop this I think that would be the
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the committee the
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee would develop
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you you're
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
welcome okay representative McGee has a
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
question um Mr chair I was going to ask
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
if anyone else is speaking on this bill
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
because I I have a question really of
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
doe if there if somebody else is coming
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
yes there is one other person signed up
 
00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.390 align:start position:0%
yes there is one other person signed up
to

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
speak it is not doe well I have a
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
question of doe if I could I will gladly
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
vacate the chair well before you vacate
 
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
the chair I have a couple of questions
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll come back to uh representative
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
McGee's questions after that my first
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
is will the
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
or does the Federal Communications
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
Commission Lifeline program provide any
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh of the information that you
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
seek uh with this study
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
committee I don't know but that's
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
certainly something the committee could
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
look into and the information could be
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
gathered from
 
00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
there okay my follow-up question is on
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
page two of the
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
bill lines one through three it talks
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
about the committee shall report its
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
findings and recommendations for
 
00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:35.390 align:start position:0%
findings and recommendations for
proposed

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
legislation but if you go back to page
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
one lines 18 through
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
26 there is no mention
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the committee's duties that
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
it will identify or
 
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.109 align:start position:0%
it will identify or
Define

00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
legislation so I'm having difficulty
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
understanding just understanding just
 
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what the
 
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
report is supposed to do is supposed to
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
provide at the end of the
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
process uh that's an excellent
 
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
observation and as an extech writer I
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
would agree that those two pieces don't
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
match um I think it is implied for
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
committees um any study committee that
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
the uh end result is some sort of
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation whether it's
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
legislatively or or agent agency-wide
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
but um but you're right those those two
 
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.030 align:start position:0%
but um but you're right those those two
pieces

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
don't specifically match but I think it
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's implied of all committees that they
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
the end result is a recommendation of
 
00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:43.270 align:start position:0%
the end result is a recommendation of
some

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
sort okay thank you very much now we'll
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
let you off the
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
hook representative Kennedy has one last
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
question go ahead I have one last boring
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
question sure uh this is a a procedure
 
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
Al question and it probably just shows
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
my ignorance but the the members of the
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
uh committee from the house and the
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
Senate it just says appointed there's
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
nothing about party affiliation is that
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
work I am not aware of any committee
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
that's formed by by party I think it's
 
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
only by members I I could be wrong I
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
don't know Mr chair are you can you
 
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
answer that one well I do know that when
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
the speaker appoints people to study
 
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:29.559 align:start position:0%
committees he does try to balance
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
um between Republicans and Democrats to
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
the best of his ability I understand
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
that but it's not it's never written
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
into to law is it it is occasionally
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
really it is yes I'll look into that
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas and now um
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
come forward and answer a question from
 
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.589 align:start position:0%
come forward and answer a question from
representative

00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
McGee

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
good morning uh committee uh Mr chair
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee uh for the
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
record Griffin Roberge uh State energy
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
program manager at the New Hampshire
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
Department of energy uh first time
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
testifying in 2024 so good to see each
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
of you uh willing to take any questions
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
on this bill but I just want to note
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
that um the department did not um intend
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill uh I might not
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
have readily available answers but more
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
than willing to get back to you
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
later yes thank you Mr Rob I appreciate
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
your willingness to come up here and try
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
and help us my question gets to the
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
question I provide I gave earlier or the
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
information I provided earlier and it
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
goes to um the question of whether
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
there's a need for the bill because
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when we have study committees
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's the main thing that we grapple
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
with and so I wondered if you could
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
provide additional information about the
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
program that was implemented as a result
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
of our emergency funding because I had
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
read an article in the spring following
 
00:49:58.109 --> 00:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
the passage of that bill to provide
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
emergency relief for people's High
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
electric bills uh that said that I think
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
under 5% of the money had actually gone
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
out the door so we we put a significant
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
amount of money into that and declared
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
Victory and said we've got money that's
 
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
going to go out to people it's going to
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
help but it didn't get to the people so
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
I I would like you to comment on whether
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
the agency is aware of any difficulty in
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
us maybe reaching intended audiences
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
because I think that's the essence of
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
this bill sure and uh thank you for the
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
question I don't think I could maybe
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
give a direct answer on that just
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
because respectfully I've been
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
completely focused on 2024 legislation
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
you're asking me to unearth something
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
from last year um but I do know that you
 
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
know there has been um some discussion
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
about some uptake in the HB 2023
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
emergency uh assistance program um you
 
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
know more than willing to follow back up
 
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:51.640 align:start position:0%
with with a lot more specifics on that
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
but I I I would just want to note that
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
um what what was the final version of
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2023 was not what um I would
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
submit the department was maybe
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
advocating for because I think we had
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
initially identified at in in the
 
00:51:10.349 --> 00:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
initial discussions on that bill is that
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
allow giving everybody assistance on
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
their bill would be the easiest way
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
because you are the way the program came
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
out is that you are asking people who
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
traditionally do not take advantage of
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
assistance programs to now all of a
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
sudden become familiar with those
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
programs and to take advantage of it
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
whereas it would have been a lot easier
 
00:51:32.349 --> 00:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
if there was just a a simple dollar
 
00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
amount allocated to everybody's Bill to
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
bring down that that cost a little bit
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
um but I'm more than willing to dig into
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of the specifics
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the uptake and follow back up
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
via email if that's
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you for that thank you
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
all right next step is um Mara Weston oh
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Doug Thomas has
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
a question thank thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
based on what your answer was to
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative McGee here just one quick
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
question does the department have a
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
mechanism to receive feedback on any of
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
its programs um or people calling in
 
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
requesting help uh or is it just someone
 
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:16.799 align:start position:0%
making a phone call sure and thank you
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
for the question uh as I think most
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
members of this committee are aware we
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
have a wonderful division director by
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
the name of uh Amanda Nunan who runs our
 
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
consumer service division at our
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
department um that division is staffed
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
with a number of folks who kind of
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
manage I guess you could say a call
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
center receive emails calls from uh
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
various constituents on a variety of
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
things disconnections having difficulty
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
with uh the Community Action Agency uh
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
trouble with their bill um so I would
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
say there is a dedicated uh Team of
 
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
Staff who are regularly involved in
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
providing constituent service to energy
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%

00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic please thank you how
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%

England tele connectivity and
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Association and in
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our members include Bree
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
line Charter Communications and Comcast
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm really here this morning to
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
offer our association as a resource if
 
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill were to move forward in
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
general I don't often find myself
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of study
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
committees but this is one where we
 
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
think actually there could be good value
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
um to constituents um we'd like to be a
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
partner in any of the conversations
 
00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:00.799 align:start position:0%
um and although we would never advocate
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
for taxpayer subsidized access to the
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
internet as I think representative
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
Harrington mentioned we always advocate
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
for awareness adoption and leveraging um
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
existing programs and one program for
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
example that our members have invested
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
heavily in is the affordable
 
00:54:22.109 --> 00:54:22.119 align:start position:0%
connectivity program and that program
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
provides discounts to um
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
to customers who need uh assistance both
 
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
in in terms of um accessing the service
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
and also accessing equipment um and what
 
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
we know is that to date uh less than
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
38,000 New Hampshire households have
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
enrolled in this program and we think
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
that this is one example where um
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
entities such as those I represent and
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
the state could partner together to help
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
educate New Hampshire citizens about
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
these types of programs so that if they
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
don't have access or access to the
 
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
equipment they would know and understand
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
what what is available to them so we do
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
see benefit in this we support the
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
effort and would' be happy to partner if
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
forward okay questions from the
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
committee representative Doug
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um very simple
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
question you um and I excuse me for not
 
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
remembering the program that you
 
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
referenced the less than 38,000 people
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
that uh uh had not or had only rolled I
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
guess in it um H how do you know that
 
00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
and what percentage of the overall
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
population does it
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
represent so I have written testimony
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
for you and I'm looking at it and
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
there's a footnote here that says there
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
is an ACP enrollment and claims
 
00:55:55.029 --> 00:55:55.039 align:start position:0%
tracker um that we referenced for that
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
that 38 37,000 plus number and in New
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um our members serve
 
00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.870 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um our members serve
approximately

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
485,000 customers now they're not all
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to be eligible for these types of
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
programs but we think that there is a
 
00:56:13.789 --> 00:56:13.799 align:start position:0%
gap that there are people who may be
 
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for uh these types of
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
low-income programs who are not
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
currently accessing them and that's just
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
one example of one program um there are
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
many different programs that are offered
 
00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
by different providers and we see that
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
there are many barriers to access and we
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
just would want to work to educate folks
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
and get the word
 
00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:36.349 align:start position:0%
and get the word
out

00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for the followup
 
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear and I don't doubt
 
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
those figures whatsoever but just to be
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
clear how do you differentiate
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
between the Gap people in in in the Gap
 
00:56:56.109 --> 00:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
as they're being in a gap because they
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
don't know about the program or they
 
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
don't care to apply for the program or
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
they just don't think it's worth it for
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
them to apply how how do you
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
differentiate between all of
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm not the
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
expert um so I I don't have those
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
answers for you today but I think if
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
this were to move forward my clients
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
would certainly want to educate you all
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
more about all the various programs that
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
they have who is accessing them and what
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
the criteria are for access to those
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
programs I know we partner with the
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
schools in some instances with
 
00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:37.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities in some instances and so
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
in general we would want to encourage
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know any partnership to help get the
 
00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
educate representative McGee has a
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Miss Wesson
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um so you are a
 
00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
telecommunications and connect ity
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
company and you also are unable to
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily identify all of the people
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
that you need to reach out to so um so
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
it it sounds to me as though you're
 
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
coming to us understanding that this is
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
an issue that would be helped by greater
 
00:58:16.109 --> 00:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
Focus um since the state itself has had
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
trouble identifying certain populations
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like you do too right you
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
you have something to offer those
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
populations but you don't have an easy
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
way to reach them is that correct
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
correct so I represent the the
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
association and our members in New
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are the providers and yes I
 
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
mean we we as I said partner with school
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
districts municipalities any
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
organizations that we can we go out into
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
the communities to educate about various
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
programs that we offer and yes we do
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
perceive that there is a gap and so we
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
welcome any opportunity to continue that
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
educational process thank you you're
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:01.950 align:start position:0%
educational process thank you you're
welcome

00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
representative kman has a
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh you said that
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
uh you don't advocate for taxpayer
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
subsidies uh yet it sounds like you are
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
funding various programs I'm just
 
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
curious where this funding comes
 
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
from uh there are various Federal
 
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
programs that we Implement and um we
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
also have our own programs funded by our
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
members Internet Essentials and again
 
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
there's a variety programs but our
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
members look to provide service wherever
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
they can provide service and to whomever
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
they can provide service and we do have
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
many different programs to help achieve
 
00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
adoption okay further questions
 
00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.829 align:start position:0%
adoption okay further questions
seeing

00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:56.839 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
none thank you I want to thank you Miss
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
Weston for testifying and now I'll call
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
on representative muse from Portsmouth
 
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
to talk about the bill that he
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
introduced or is the prime sponsor
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
of Representative Muse welcome to
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
sdn thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
colleagues and my apologies uh for being
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
late we've had an an interesting morning
 
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
on the Sea Coast we typically don't get
 
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of snow and uh this storm we got
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
more snow than
 
01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:30.109 align:start position:0%
more snow than
anyone

01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
um one of the reasons why I ran for
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
office um after 30 years of working and
 
01:00:39.309 --> 01:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
Consulting is that I like to solve
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
problems and when I see problems one of
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
the things that I try to do is I try to
 
01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
understand them a little bit better
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
because I think you need to understand a
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
problem before you jump in and try to uh
 
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.870 align:start position:0%
problem before you jump in and try to uh
suggest

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
Solutions um I I think what this bill is
 
01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
about is better understanding a problem
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
that's hurting our state's reputation
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
and also hurting a lot of lower inome
 
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
people in this
 
01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.589 align:start position:0%
people in this
state

01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
um many of the people who are eligible
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
for programs like low-income heating
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
assistance SNAP benefit uh SNAP benefits
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh as well as uh Medicaid Health Care
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
are low-income people who do not have
 
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
access to uh devices like computers uh
 
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
and smartphones uh some do uh it's
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
inconsistent sometimes they may have a
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
device but they may no longer uh
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
actually have a carrier that can get
 
01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
information to them um and so one of the
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
things that we continually run into as
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
an issue across agencies in New
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the entire issue of how do
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
you actually reach these
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
people um and one of the things that we
 
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
hear a lot from the agencies themselves
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not like the agencies
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
themselves aren't working hard but one
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
of the things that we uh that we hear a
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
lot is that um essentially they're
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
they're working hard to get the word out
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh and and when you work for a state
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
agency in New Hampshire uh communication
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
is about getting the word out the
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunate thing is when all we're when
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
that becomes our goal then putting
 
01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.390 align:start position:0%
that becomes our goal then putting
anything

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
out is a way to address that goal and to
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
solve the problem without actually
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
solving the problem uh a lot of times we
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a measurable goal and that's
 
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
why uh we could have we we may be having
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
an issue uh with the Medicaid coverage
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
for children where 6,500 kids uh uh are
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
now off of uh Medicaid uh because their
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
parents never responded to an
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility check request in information
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
well why is that did the parents just
 
01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.950 align:start position:0%
well why is that did the parents just
ignore

01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
ignore
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
it did the parents get the word how are
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
we how are we doing this um when it
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
comes to SNAP benefits we actually had
 
01:03:10.109 --> 01:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
to pay we I'm sorry we actually had to
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
pass a bill uh a year or so ago SB
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
404 because our Outreach numbers were so
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
bad uh we realized that we had to do
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
something about them um and we actually
 
01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.430 align:start position:0%
something about them um and we actually
appropriated

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
$250,000 for an Outreach program uh to
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
increase snap Outreach uh at the time we
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
passed that bill uh only about half the
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
people who are eligible for these
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
benefits we actually taking advantage of
 
01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.390 align:start position:0%
benefits we actually taking advantage of
them

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.069 align:start position:0%
them
so

01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
um this is something that is when I see
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
these stories it it it bothers me and
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
and I think probably the one that
 
01:03:48.029 --> 01:03:48.039 align:start position:0%
bothered me more than any and probably
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
the reason why this bill is in front of
 
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
this committee is what happened with
 
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
low-income energy assistance last year
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
where we had a $35
 
01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
million uh appropriation and the idea
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
was that uh this money would actually go
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
to lower income people who just were
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
outside the eligibility guidelines uh
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
for federal low-income heating
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
assistance uh and ultimately we had
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
about 2% of the people who are eligible
 
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the program um and
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
about 2% of that money actually spent on
 
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
heating relief during a summer that I
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
can tell you or during a winter that I
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
can tell you from my own personal
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
experience was probably the single most
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
expensive winter deita home that uh I've
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
had in New Hampshire and I'm guessing a
 
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
lot of other people were were in the
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
same situation as
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
well um so the response to that uh was
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
was interesting um one of the things
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we we did was in instead of
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
questioning Outreach um and and how we
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
were actually trying to uh to make
 
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
people aware of this and and and make it
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
simpler let's say for them to to take
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
advantage of the of the um you know of
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
this particular this particular program
 
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
um one of the responses was we should
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
have just given $100 to
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
everybody um because that would have
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
been a lot easier and so the the
 
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
question that I have is given all of the
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
different programs that we have that
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
Target low-income people
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
what is it that's so difficult about
 
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
reaching these folks um how can agencies
 
01:05:34.269 --> 01:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire begin to work better
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
together um not only when they have a
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
program to communicate but in general um
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
are there things that we can be doing uh
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
as a state that will that will help the
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
situation so so for example one of the
 
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
things that might help is more awareness
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
of a federal program that actually
 
01:05:54.029 --> 01:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
subsidizes um Internet carrier chares
 
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
charers for low-income people uh that's
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
available so there are there are things
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
out there uh there are pieces out there
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
I think there are fragments of solutions
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
um but what we have consistently in the
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
state is an approach where every agency
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
that has to tackle this kind of a
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
program uh seems to think it it's enough
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
to have a campaign to get the word out
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
without actually saying what are the
 
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
measurable goals that we are trying to
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
achieve and then driving towards those
 
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
measurable goals um I worked in in
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
Consulting for a long time and one of
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
the ways you sort of mask the people who
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
are trying to take your money for
 
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
communication versus people who are
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
trying to solve your problem or the
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
people who are trying to take your money
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
would say we could spend it on this we
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
could spend it on that we can get the
 
01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
word out right the people who are
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
actually trying to solve the problem
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
first of all are trying to understand
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
better uh and then what they what
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do is once they F once
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
they they believe they understand the
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
problem they set measurable goals and
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
targets that actually are demonstrations
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
of progress that they're actually
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
meeting meeting these goals and with
 
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
with programs like this I mean we have a
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
a big measurable is how many people are
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of them what percentage
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
of them is that but I think one of the
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
things that's important for us to do is
 
01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
to begin working towards achievable
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
goals in area in areas like this and and
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that when we approve
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
programs like this we have
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
targets uh and that those targets are
 
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:39.799 align:start position:0%
clearly communicated to state agency
 
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
this is one of the things that that
 
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
frustrates me you know when I when I see
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
situations like what happened with
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
low-income heating assistance is because
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think it had to be that way
 
01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
there there were there were things that
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
went wrong from the paper based
 
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
application process there were there
 
01:07:58.109 --> 01:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
were many things that that slowed it
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
down but given our history uh of
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
communicating with that type of a
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
population number one we should have
 
01:08:08.269 --> 01:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
known better and and number
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
two I think that there there are things
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
that we can do as as a legislature to
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
make it uh to to basically improve
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
results in this area and and I think the
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
bottom line is if we're going to spend
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
money on these things let's make sure we
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
spend wisely and the people who are
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
targeted to get this kind of help are
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
actually in a position where they can
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
get it and I don't think anybody felt
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
great about what happened to low-income
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
heating assistance last year and so part
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
of this and what I would urge you to do
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
is if there are things in my bill that
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
you don't like that if you they they're
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily aligned with a problem
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
that as as you see it that needs to be
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
solved please go ahead and change it but
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
but I think this is work that that does
 
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
need to be done and it's work that can
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
result I think in some point at F in
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
future legislation or um a uh just
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
smarter interaction uh smarter bills
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
when we write them and smarter
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
interactions with the agencies uh that
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
we support as
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
legislatures and with that I'll take any
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
questions you might have thank you
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
representative Muse questions
 
01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr chair
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I'm glad you
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
were able to get here
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh you've um provided a some more
 
01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
insight into this bill than we we had
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
previously I I have two questions the
 
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
first is um it sounds like this is much
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
more than just trying to
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
ensure computer or internet access to
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
the greatest number of people is that
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
correct I would say it's a it's a big
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
part of it and and I think part of it is
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
just the way the uh the uh uh Les wrote
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
the uh wrote the analysis of the bill um
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
but yeah I think it it's wider spread I
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
think the I think the issue is why do we
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
seem to consistently have issues uh
 
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
reaching and getting the kind of numbers
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
that we're looking to get when whenever
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about some type of a
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
program that impacts low-income people
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
okay um that that's that's really what
 
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get it and then my my
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
second question was and I had asked this
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
previously um I I think you you know
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
everything that you've described are
 
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
certainly uh things that we should take
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
a look at um I I guess I I wonder why
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
the need for a study committee why
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't this just be um an in agency
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
task force that's uh directed to provide
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
a report um and and I I come from that
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
um you know I I base that on the fact
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
that I don't really know what three
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
representatives and three senators are
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do to add to the
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
discussion it it could be an inter inter
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
agency tax task force the is the issue
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
is how do you get one of those assembled
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
um so if we think that one of the
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
solutions to this or or a way to
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
approach it might be creating an inter
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
agency task force after we get the
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
information I think that's great the
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
problem that we have now is that we
 
01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
don't have an inter agency task force
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
what we have are a bunch of separate
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
agencies doing their own thing and
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get the word out all in their
 
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
job representative Corman has a
 
01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh just
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
very simply I noticed that there's a a
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
Target date of November 1st of this year
 
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
for that report given that we don't even
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
know when this commit committee would be
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
formed do you feel that that that's
 
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
really enough time to get all the data
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
and then make appropriate
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations second-year study
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
committees are always a challenge and
 
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest challenges that we
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
face is that by I think November 3rd or
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
4th uh some of us may still be here and
 
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
some of us may not be so I think that's
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why why uh why that
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
deadline uh to make sure that we have it
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
so that the next legislature is in a
 
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
position where they can use this
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
information representative lii has a
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
um my question is um why do we want to
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
do this through the legislature we've
 
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
had the example of the fuel assistance
 
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
program and the 2% uptake however
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know from my point of view
 
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
that was a safety net and we didn't want
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
people freezing in New Hampshire in this
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
case why would the telecommunications
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
companies not try to make potential
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
customers aware of these programs that
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
are available that basically the money
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
would flow to them do we really need to
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
have the legislature
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
involved I think one of the reasons to
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
involve the legislature is we see we're
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
just extremely inconsistent about how we
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
do this so for example in the case of of
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
S sp404 um we actually approved a
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million dollars for
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
targeted Outreach I believe that the New
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire food bank is in charge of that
 
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
and then one of the things that they're
 
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
doing is they're actually working with
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
other food banks across the state to
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
increase awareness of the benefit um
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
they're also doing things on their
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
website as opposed to the State website
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
uh so there's they're basically a lot of
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
good things that are happening there um
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm not 100% sure of even even now
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
is how effective have some of those
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
things been you know are they seeing is
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
is Outreach actually turning into an
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
uptick in results because I think it's
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
important even when we try to do the
 
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
right thing not not to just Pat
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves on the back and and go away
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
and said well we tried to do the right
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
thing but but to kind of go back and to
 
01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
take a look and try to understand it you
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
know so we tried to do the right thing
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
did it actually work you know are are
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
more people signed up for SNAP benefits
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
are we finding that you know are there
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
still gaps um you know who's not signing
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
up for benefits what do we know about
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
those people do we know anything about
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
them is there any way we can get more
 
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
information about about them and how we
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
might be able to reach them in a way
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
that we're not doing now this is a thing
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
and and having worked in this field for
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
a long time I wor I did a lot of
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
corporate communication work and every
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
company you work for uh was different
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
they were retailers there were defense
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
contractors they were computer companies
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
and software companies um they they were
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
all very very different um but one of
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
the things that you we found pretty
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
consistently is when it came to lower
 
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
paid workers there were a lot of
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
commonalities and a lot of learning
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
experience that you you can kind of have
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
across those silos so I'm I'm thinking
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
and and sort of part of the theory
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
behind that this bill is if we you know
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
if we look at the way that agencies are
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
doing it now we can break down some of
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
the those silos encourage the sharing of
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
information and really just help these
 
01:15:15.149 --> 01:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
programs be more effective because when
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
we're spending the taxpayers money we
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're spending it
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
effectively and efficiently on the
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
things that we wanted to spend it on in
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
place all right thank you representative
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
Muse uh glad you made it in today and U
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
I'd really like to move on because uh
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're 15 minutes late for our current uh
 
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
most our next public hearing do you
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely need to ask this question
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's just ack one all right a quick
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
question from representative McGee thank
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair yeah um we had a question
 
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
earlier about whether the committee
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
would be focused on sort of a selective
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
solution and the question that I have
 
01:15:59.790 --> 01:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
is would you anticipate that U that a
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
committee like this or a task force
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be looking
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
for categories of populations that maybe
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
need to be dealt with differently so
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
that when we send something out we would
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
understand whether there are people who
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
maybe will never have technology access
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
because they've missed the boat and
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
they're older and they're not going to
 
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
learn and they don't want to use a
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
computer so I'm just curious whether you
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
think that we might also come up with
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
more of a composite about what kinds of
 
01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
resistance we're dealing with in terms
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
of reaching people yeah it I I think
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
that's all part of understanding the
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
problem uh so so yes and and and my hope
 
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
is that when a committee like this comes
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
together we actually have a fair number
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
of people in the house who have
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
communication backgrounds so um you know
 
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
keeping an eye on that as as we'd be
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
selecting members of the committee I
 
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
think would be helpful uh just simply
 
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of basic
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
information about about Outreach and
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
targeting and things like that that
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
folks like that might already be aware
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
of and and it wouldn't be coming at them
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh the first time so and I know
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGee you're one of those
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
folks uh and I think we have some others
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
in the room as well so um so
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
yeah all right thank you very much we
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here and I have no
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
more pink cards on this bill so I'm
 
01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
1047 and
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
spite of the fact that I would like to
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
take a break we're not going to because
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit late so I'm going to
 
01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
open a public hearing on House Bill 1230
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
relative to establishing a committee to
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
examine weatherization initiatives for
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
homes in New Hampshire and I'm going to
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
call on representative Chuck grassy the
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
this bill to our committee welcome to
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
see you again this was my um a committee
 
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
that I served three terms on back in the
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
70s so when it first started uh but uh
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%

here to introduce House Bill uh 1230
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
which deals with weatherization uh one
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
of the things I could say right now is
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
that all of the testimony you just heard
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
is relevant to what I have here I
 
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
probably don't have to say anymore uh
 
01:18:18.629 --> 01:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you that um I was
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
working have been working with a number
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
of groups over the summer and last
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
spring as well uh dealing with Energy
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency um and and housing two
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
different topics completely uh but one
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that I found is that there
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
was a large uh problem uh with our
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
weatherization program our Energy
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs uh that we really
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
weren't getting the Outreach it was
 
01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
necessary now I understand that these
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
are done through the Caps um but one of
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
the major constituencies that we have
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
that tend to not um take advantage of
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
this program as you heard previously uh
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
is seniors uh there's a large group of
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
seniors uh that in our in our state who
 
01:19:02.629 --> 01:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
um do not have the technology to go
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
online to get this information do not
 
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
understand the application process in
 
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
many cases and the application process
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
can be very very complicated uh and what
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
I've done is is requested that a
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee with only one Senator makes it
 
01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:19.639 align:start position:0%
easier to get them together um and three
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
house members that would study this over
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
the summer and BAS basically intake
 
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
information from the state and the
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate cap agencies uh on how uh
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know what the process is currently
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
and how we can make things better and
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
easier and increase that Outreach I had
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
a personal experience with the New
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves program uh went through
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
a situation about 10 years ago where we
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
were replacing the furnace in our house
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
that had failed um everything was going
 
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
well and uh when the contractors came in
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
I went online to see what kind of
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
assistance was available there was
 
01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
assistance available for me that we
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
qualified for uh worked with Unitil they
 
01:19:58.830 --> 01:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
said oh yes you qualify for this and I'm
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
pretty astute as far as computer's
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
concerned and I checked right along all
 
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
the way uh when my contractor finally
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
gave me and I had checked the week
 
01:20:08.189 --> 01:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
before and it was still taking
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
applications on November 1st
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my contractor delivered
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
the invoice and I went online there was
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
no money available that cost me
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
$2,800 that and the thing is is that I
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
think what we need to do as a state and
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
as a committee is to gather this
 
01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
information and take a look at how we
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
can improve the accessibility to these
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
programs and particularly the
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
weatherization program uh so that more
 
01:20:35.229 --> 01:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
people who are in need can take
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
advantage of it uh this will not only
 
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
save those people dollars but will also
 
01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
save the state in uh and as far as
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency is concerned um as I
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
said everything that was said before
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
pertains to this bill as well um so I
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
think it's two bills you could put
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
together and you could probably even
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
have the same study committee with two
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
less Senators if I understood you right
 
01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:01.639 align:start position:0%
and I will be happy to answer any
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions for
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
representative grassy representative
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
you representative grassy for taking my
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
question I actually work with a
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
community agency based in White River
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
Junction and we do weatherization for
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
low-income people in the Upper Valley so
 
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm certainly in favor of getting
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
more weatherization done uh the bill
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
talks about proper weatherization and
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is how how how is that
 
01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:33.270 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is how how how is that
defined

01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
um as you know legislative Services was
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
backed up a lot of times when this bill
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
did come out um you basically to what
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
you got out of legislative services and
 
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
I know that I had one re re rewrite
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
rewrite and I got it on the last in fact
 
01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
I didn't even have it on the last day we
 
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
had to sign off without having a final
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill in hand uh I don't know how you
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
defined uh proper weatherization I think
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
that um that's something that the
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee could certainly take a look at
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
and may want to amend it to to change
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
the wording on that uh but I think that
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at is weatherization
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
that will help save people um that we
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
create a more efficient uh structure and
 
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
and home uh for renters and homeowners
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh and uh that would uh save people
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
money all all along because you're not
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
only saving money for the homeowners
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
you're saving money through uh fuel
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
assistance programs as well
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
and uh so how you determine proper I I
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what the word how you define
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
that followup thank you for the followup
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
um the follow-up is uh in terms of
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
actually identifying uh where we need
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
weatherization am I correct that that
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
you would uh say that we'd probably be
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
doing it through state agencies and the
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
community action programs they would be
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
our sources of information well I think
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
you could also use yes but I think you
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
could also use local communities as well
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
because because sometimes building
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
inspectors uh and tax assessors have
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
that information as well particularly
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at at homes uh that
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
people live in which may be substandard
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
um and these were things that you could
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
do to um to to help those folks so if
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
you're aware of a an apartment complex
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
or an older home that has been converted
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
that has not uh been brought up to full
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency standards uh that uh
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
that a building inspector may be able to
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
make you aware of that so I would say
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
that sometimes the cities building
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
inspector or Town's building inspector's
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
office would be a place you could also
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
get further information as
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
well representative lecki has a question
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:23:33.239 --> 01:23:34.910 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
representative

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
um I as a hypothetical I still wonder
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
why we need to be involved as a
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
legislature in this if I were a
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
weatherization contractor I'd buy myself
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
an infrared camera drive around and
 
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
identify potential customers and let
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
them know that there was Aid available
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
and so excuse me um I'm just wondering
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
why would we would want to do this
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
through the state when individual um
 
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
contractor has a great incentive to try
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
to identify the properties that need
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
help uh that would be nice uh so but
 
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
representative but it doesn't happen um
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
most these contractors are relatively
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
busy as well so I don't see them going
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately additional questions
 
01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.110 align:start position:0%
unfortunately additional questions
representative

01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of goes along with the
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
previous uh legislation that we heard
 
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
from and that is that uh you're you're
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
talking about a problem where we don't
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
we don't know what we don't know so
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
would you agree that that you know a
 
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
large part of the problem is that we
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a good idea of what the
 
01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
housing stock in New Hampshire is and
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
this is as much a housing problem as it
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
is a weatherization problem and and so
 
01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:53.719 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's the unknown that we
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
need to seek more information about
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that question
 
01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
that's very important and that's what
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
got me involved in this is that I was
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
working with the housing group in
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
straford county and also a state group
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
that will hopefully be testifying you've
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
received some testify testimony from
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony from them as well and
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
when I was also dealing on the energy
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
side of things I I found that there was
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
a convergence between these two groups
 
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
the housing group that I was working
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
with that we don't know and that is part
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
of the problem we don't know and that
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
the Outreach is not working that we
 
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
currently have and we need to find a
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
different way to to do it and I'm hoping
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
that you know we may not come up to the
 
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
answer between now and November first uh
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
but at least we'll start bringing the
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
information together into a central
 
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
database someplace that somebody may be
 
01:25:38.669 --> 01:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
able to utilize to move forward with
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.709 align:start position:0%
 
future

01:25:43.709 --> 01:25:43.719 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
representative Ms has a
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
you representative for uh taking my
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
question um when you were doing research
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
on this uh on this bill did you reach
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
out to the Department of energy to see
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
if they have any reports that address
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
some of the um the items that you've
 
01:26:07.390 --> 01:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
listed as the duties of the committee no
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
I I did not read out the department of
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
energy but I did work with our local cap
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
in in straford County cap okay uh to uh
 
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
talk with them about what they're doing
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
and I found that there were things that
 
01:26:18.189 --> 01:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
were deficient uh such as they did not
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
know what the housing stock was uh and
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
what the opportunities were for them
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
they just you know they they get as much
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh they get as many applications as they
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
want uh and they fulfill those um could
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
they handle more work sure uh did they
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
want more more work not necessarily uh
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
but uh the thing is is that uh I found
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
that talking with a lot of clients or
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
people that need the service is that the
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
application process was very difficult
 
01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
and this is something we need to take a
 
01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
look at as well that you know when
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
you've got particularly seniors who uh
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
made as I said before may not have
 
01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
computer access um or may not um be
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
aware of they you know they aren't
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
keeping up their financial records the
 
01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
way they have in the past uh but they uh
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
they may be on Snap they may be on a few
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
other programs um these we we need to
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
make things we need to provide more
 
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
assistance to them as well and I think
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that this committee uh
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
could find that is there a way that we
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
can do our Outreach better and provide
 
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
better assistance to people to be able
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
to get um more uh WEA isation done
 
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Wendy Thomas
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair um
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here thank you for
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I um am a
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
certified building analyst through the U
 
01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
building performance Institute and so
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I learned is that
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
most houses most buildings and actually
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's not just houses but businesses lose
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
between 25 to 35% of their energy costs
 
01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
literally through the roof because of
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
poor insulation so I mean making sure
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
that buildings are insulated is a big
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
deal that's the best way you can save
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
money uh for your household or
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
anything NH saves does a pretty good job
 
01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
with weatherization information and
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
rebates and things like that how do you
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
see this
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
committee working with NH saves would it
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
replace NH saves would it link arms with
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
NH saves is does have nothing to do with
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
NH saves well no I I don't think it
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
replaces them for sure and and and I
 
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
don't see this committee I I see this
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
committee is basically taking a look at
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
the situation working with NH saves to
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
say how are you identifying your your
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
clients how are you providing more data
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
to them the problem I had with NH saves
 
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
is when I started my project I had to
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
wait till I got an invoice before I
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
submitted and when I finally submitted
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
the invoice the money was gone if I had
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
been able to lock in that promise at the
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of the project it would have
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
saved me a lot of problems um and and uh
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
you know that's something we need to
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
take a look at are the programs working
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
the way they supposed to are people um
 
01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
aware of what the responsibilities are
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
and what they have to do and then is
 
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
there assistance to be able to help
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
people along the
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
you representative Doug Thomas has a
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um this question
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
is mainly like
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
um I I wanted to feel if R
 
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
intent is what you're
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
proposing only go so far as informing
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
people that the program is available and
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
by that I mean I know there are people
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
out there particularly seniors um maybe
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
they might like to have better
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
weatherization but they don't want
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
people coming into their house and they
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't want people saying hey you should
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
have weatherization because you're not
 
01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
doing your part and we must come in your
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
house but they don't want to so I want
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
to be sure that the intent of this
 
01:29:59.709 --> 01:29:59.719 align:start position:0%
program would be just to inform that the
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
program is available and it really
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't go much farther than that is
 
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
that is that what your in intent is well
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't thank you for the question I I
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
don't think it's I mean certainly the
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
program doesn't Force anybody to have
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
their house inspected um and and if
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
people are made aware that the
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
information that the the funds are
 
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
available or services available um you
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
know that's that's fine and I think that
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
the the study committee in itself would
 
01:30:30.109 --> 01:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
look at beyond that uh into not just
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
making information available to people
 
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
but when we collect data we almost we
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
also may be able to identify additional
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
resources that are available beyond the
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
weatherization program that will help
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
people with energy efficiencies in their
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
homes particularly for low income and
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
seniors uh who who do need that help um
 
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
there's no programming if you don't want
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
people to come into your house there's
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
nothing we can force you to do to make
 
01:30:53.709 --> 01:30:53.719 align:start position:0%
us go into your house or to L Us in that
 
01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
I don't see that as any intent in here
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
you representative MC Williams has a
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair um thank you
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
representative Grassi uh my question is
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
related to two two technical issues um
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
just sort of an awareness piece uh the
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
first is um using high resolution
 
01:31:20.109 --> 01:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
thermal imaging via GPS and satellite um
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is probably more of a department of
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
energy than representative grassy issue
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
but I think that uh the awareness that
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
we do have data and that the state is
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
able to access this data would make a
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
big difference especially to
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas's comment
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
about the roof being the number one uh
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
area where residential buildings lose
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
their heat in the winter time and so
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
you're basically throwing your money out
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
the roof all winter while you're trying
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
to heat it and so using satellite
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
analysis of each of these known
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
locations where we have folks who are
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
Poss possibly eligible and if they knew
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
they were eligible they might apply for
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
some funds and stop throwing money out
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
of the roof using um high resolution
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
thermal imaging could be that data
 
01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
aggregator piece to address some of this
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
information so I just wanted to put that
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
out there are you familiar with this yes
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
okay and has your town been using this
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
EXC excuse me has your town been using
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
this not that I'm aware of okay all
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
right and then the second piece to this
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
is um how we track our building data in
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire specifically
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
for res presential we've had
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
conversations in this committee before
 
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
and I just want to bring it up again
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
because I think it's relevant to this
 
01:32:31.149 --> 01:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
discussion um we have talked about doing
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
some kind of metrics to analyze when a
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
building is sold when a residence is
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
sold if we were to do a blower door test
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
and include that information as part of
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
the MLS listing for the house that's
 
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
being sold then there would be data on
 
01:32:48.669 --> 01:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
that building in the marketplace
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
historical data that shows it was sold
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
in 2022 to and it had a blower door test
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
and this is the data on its performance
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
at that time so I think that being able
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
to track and having some sort of um data
 
01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
that carries with the building helps us
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
do our work better is your committee
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
looking at something like that to manage
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
the data that that wouldn't be outside
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
of its scope I think it's something that
 
01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
could be uh certainly could be involved
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
with that um in my career I spent 25
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
years as a town planner and I was also
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
one of the first people to work on on
 
01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
GIS here in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
I'm working with the granite system and
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
I think that that would be an excent
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
Resource as well to bring that type of
 
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh information in um you know I was not
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
aware that they were places were doing
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
that type of stuff I hadn't heard of
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
anything I've been out of the field for
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
more than 10 years now uh but certainly
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
that would be a tremendous asset that
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
this committee could look at as as
 
01:33:41.709 --> 01:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
bringing in and using as a resource uh
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
to provide more data to these the cap
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
agencies who are the on the ground
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
people uh when it comes to
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
weatherization awesome yeah so just for
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
your reference thank you yes uh SpaceX
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
company satellite view is one of the big
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
ones that's doing it now thank you I'm
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
done representative MC Williams you
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
weren't here at the beginning of our
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
session but I just reminded everybody
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
that if you want to ask a follow-up
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
question you do have to be recognized
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
for that thank you representative McGee
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
representative grassy for coming here
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
and presenting us this bill you sort of
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned in an off-hand way that this
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill could fold into the bill that was
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
heard PRI
 
01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious whether uh you've
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
just been discussing some specifics that
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
may be very distinct from the Outreach
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
only focus of the of the first bill so
 
01:34:37.109 --> 01:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh to that point do you think that there
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
actually might be some benefit in the
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
two bills if the committee decided to in
 
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
a work session say uh combine them in
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
order to see them go forward because
 
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:45.880 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have a lot of study
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
bills that go forward I don't think and
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
and you know listening to most of the
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
testimony because a large part of this
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
is Outreach but there's also the
 
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
collection of data and I think and and
 
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
you know identification of resources and
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
I think you're looking at that in both
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
bills uh and so I think there's there's
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of similarity between the
 
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
two bills that they could be merged uh
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
to have one study committee even if you
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
had two separate bills come down it
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be both bills could be
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
sent to the same
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
you representative nter has a question
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um how much are we currently
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
spending per year for weather is it
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
information following up on
 
01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
representative n's
 
01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
question on line 20 of the
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
bill it calls for the study committee to
 
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
develop a comprehensive set of
 
01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations and potential
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
legislative proposals to promote and
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
incentivize weatherization efforts in
 
01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.189 align:start position:0%
incentivize weatherization efforts in
our

01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
state and yet there is no mention
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the bill about
 
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
analyzing the affordability and the
 
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
cost of weatherization
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
efforts and there's no mention in the
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill as currently written about
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
performing any kind of cost benefit
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
analysis of
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
particular programs or
 
01:36:16.159 --> 01:36:19.350 align:start position:0%
particular programs or
weatherization

01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
initiatives how could we move forward
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
Ward without having that vital piece of
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
information uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
you know I I I you know this is one
 
01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
thing that we have to take a a bigger
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
look at I because right now we have a
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
weatherization program and I don't think
 
01:36:39.149 --> 01:36:39.159 align:start position:0%
it's meeting the needs of our citizens
 
01:36:41.229 --> 01:36:41.239 align:start position:0%
we have a much greater demand out there
 
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
it may not be an identified demand but
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
it is a demand that it's out there um
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
and as we get are able to use better
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
Technologies as uh you know satellite um
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
infrared um that's going to even create
 
01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
a greater awareness of what is needed
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
out there um you know whether it's being
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
efficiently spent um you know what is
 
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit uh of our current
 
01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
program I don't know if anybody's really
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
identified that uh we uh you know we you
 
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
have yeah and and the thing is is that
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's something that uh um you know
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken a look at and is that
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
is the weatherization program doing its
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
currently doing its job and is it
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
efficient and um if it is there is a
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
greater need we need to identify that
 
01:37:29.709 --> 01:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
greater need that's out there find it
 
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
and and serve
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
it so can I interpret from your answer
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
that you would be willing to add to the
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
study committee's
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
charge certainly a a a requirement that
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
they do some cost benefit analysis sure
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Ms has a
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um as a as a
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
followup to the chair's question doesn't
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh or don't lines 12 through 17 in the
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill get at uh analyzing the the costs
 
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
and the benefits well thank you because
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
actually line 14 does say assessing the
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
economic and environmental benefits of
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
weatherization um and so it does uh it
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
does do that I don't know if it you know
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
if there is a cost benefit analysis uh
 
01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
but that does uh right there say that we
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
need to take a look at the benefits of
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
Economic and environmental benefits of
 
01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.270 align:start position:0%
Economic and environmental benefits of
the

01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
program I would argue that the glaring
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
Omission from that particular line is
 
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
that there's no mention of
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
costs that's what a cost benefit
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
analysis is all about well I I I'm not
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
going to just I'm not going to get into
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
debate I I think that the but we're not
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
here to debate this
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
subject I appreciate that okay seeing no
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
further questions let's move on I'd like
 
01:38:55.149 --> 01:38:55.159 align:start position:0%
to call the next uh person who wants to
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill and that is Griffin
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:26.669 align:start position:0%
 
energy

01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record Griffin
 
01:39:31.589 --> 01:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
Roberge from the New Hampshire
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
Department of energy uh here to testify
 
01:39:37.589 --> 01:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
in a neutral stance on House Bill
 
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
12:30 um working its way around the room
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
right now is a letter of testimony uh
 
01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:44.199 align:start position:0%
from the department and really what it
 
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
does is it just kind of highlights um
 
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
our Department's role in managing the
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
federal weatherization assistance
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
program or WAP um just provide the
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
letter provides a brief overview of the
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh weatherization assistance program uh
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
basically the program is a as I
 
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned a federally funded program
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
that helps homeowners and renters um by
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
providing funding for Energy Efficiency
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
measures to reduce home energy
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
consumption um this is a means tested
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
program and limited to those making uh
 
01:40:19.709 --> 01:40:19.719 align:start position:0%
less of 60% of State median income um to
 
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
deploy the program the Department
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
contracts with the five Community Action
 
01:40:25.709 --> 01:40:25.719 align:start position:0%
agencies across the state caas as I have
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the letter or community action
 
01:40:31.149 --> 01:40:31.159 align:start position:0%
programs are or caps um they operate and
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
deliver the weatherization services at
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
the local level so they conduct the
 
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
client Outreach the income verification
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
and enrollment they work directly with
 
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
contractors to uh to complete projects
 
01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.310 align:start position:0%
contractors to uh to complete projects
individual

01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
homes um once an applicant is deemed
 
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
income eligible an energy auditor will
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh contact the applicant and do a
 
01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive energy audit and identify
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
um areas of improvement in the home um
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
typically um the projects are ranked in
 
01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
terms of highest energy cost savings
 
01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
first and then they go down um so
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
typically as has been mentioned here um
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
they're largely insulation projects so
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
air sealing um uh insulation in the
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
attic wall insulation um insulation in
 
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
basements and crawl spaces um the again
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to credit the Community
 
01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
Action agencies they are very
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable um about the program uh
 
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
the program's expectations and they are
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
dedicated to stretching our WAP funding
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
to the greatest extent possible um they
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
often work quite frequently with New
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves and I believe it's the
 
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
home energy assistance program to
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
supplement WAP funding um and on average
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
um the state of New Hampshire receives
 
01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
about $2 million each year in WAP
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
funding and obviously this varies year
 
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
toe subject to uh Federal Congressional
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and then finally with the
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
passage of the infrastructure investment
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
in jobs act in
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
22 um there was a one-time appropriation
 
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
of another 18 million to the state of
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for the WAP program um I
 
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
did also want to note that in going
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
through some of the duties in the bill
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
as introduced um the department is
 
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
unable to identify the number of homes
 
01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the state that are or are
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
not weatherized um New Hampshire does
 
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
not maintain any type of database about
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
what an individual homeowner might be
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
doing in their home in terms of putting
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
insulation in the wall or putting in a
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
new heating system um and then finally
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
the thing I want to note here is that uh
 
01:42:34.109 --> 01:42:34.119 align:start position:0%
WAP is again a federally funded program
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
with federal dollars come Federal
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
strings um states are very limited in
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
modifying or changing their WAP
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
Assistance programs really in any way
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
shape or form um states are required to
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
comply with federal guidelines um if
 
01:42:50.910 --> 01:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
they do not they run the risk of having
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
their whap funds pulled back uh by the
 
01:42:56.189 --> 01:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
federal government um should the bill
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
become law um the department is
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
obviously willing to participate in the
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
committee's proceedings and um that
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
really concludes my testimony happy to
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I have a question
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
for you in 2022 we passed House Bill 549
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
which authorized the department of
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
energy to spend up to $400,000 a year to
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
promulgate the benefits of energy
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
efficiency and home weatherization can
 
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
you give us any kind of status as to
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
what the department has done with the
 
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
money so
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
allocated and what kind of programs it
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
has initiated as a result thank you for
 
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
the question um that is something I'd
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
like to follow up follow back up on
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
again because this was focused on this
 
01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
bill was focused on the uh
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs I was uniquely
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
kind of focused on our WAP program um if
 
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
right I'll follow up with you uh follow
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
up with the committee by
 
01:43:57.070 --> 01:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
email okay thank you representative
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas has a question thank you Mr
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
chair um on page two your second bullet
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
states are limited in modifying or
 
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
changing their waps um is that a general
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
warning or do you have a specific
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
concern about this bill sure and thank
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
you for the question I and I apologize
 
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
for not being more specific in the
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
letter I think that point was focused
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:22.870 align:start position:0%
letter I think that point was focused
on

01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
lines 20 and 21 in the bill where it's
 
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
talking about a comprehensive set of
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations and uh potential
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
legislative proposals again it's a
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
federal program I I just don't want
 
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
legislators state legislators getting in
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
the position of imposing State
 
01:44:40.109 --> 01:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
legislation on a federal program because
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
it puts the department in a position as
 
01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
to whether or not we're running a foul
 
01:44:45.149 --> 01:44:45.159 align:start position:0%
of federal rules and regulations or
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
state statute that's I guess where we
 
01:44:46.719 --> 01:44:47.950 align:start position:0%
state statute that's I guess where we
coming

01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
from representative PL has a question
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair thank you for taking
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
my question um how does the department
 
01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:00.679 align:start position:0%
of energy advertise this uh weap program
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
and is the funds all uh exhausted sure
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question um to the
 
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
great yeah to the greatest extent
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
possible the department uh draws down um
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
its WAP funding every year we never want
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
to be in a position where we are sending
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
money back and I'm sorry I'm answering
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
your second question first um we never
 
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
want to be in a position where we send
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
federal dollars back um to the US
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um and again to the
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
greatest extent possible the Community
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
Action agencies uh work very well to
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
stretch these dollars to the greatest
 
01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
extent possible um if a project can't be
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
done they'll often hit up the home
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
energy assistance program under New
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves to see if they can
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
extend that a little bit further um when
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
it comes to advertising the program it's
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
my understanding um that a lot of the um
 
01:45:49.229 --> 01:45:49.239 align:start position:0%
onus falls on the Community Action
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
agencies who are very well
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
um they're basically on the ground
 
01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
working with these uh lowincome
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
communities because again WAP is focus
 
01:45:59.589 --> 01:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
is a means tested program and focused on
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
those making less than 60% of mean
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
household income um so they're very well
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
Adept at making sure people are aware of
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
their program offerings um and making
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
pipeline representative nder has a
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman not to
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
put you on the spot but um more than one
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
this morning I been hearing Federal
 
01:46:25.149 --> 01:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
funding Federal funding so tell me where
 
01:46:26.669 --> 01:46:26.679 align:start position:0%
does the federal government get its
 
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
money sure and thank you for the
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
question uh it raises it um through
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
taxes from
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers representative lewicki thank
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you for the uh
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh there's been much
 
01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:44.199 align:start position:0%
mention of these Community agencies that
 
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
are doing the actual
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
Outreach do they actually have some data
 
01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
do they you you go out once again with
 
01:46:54.430 --> 01:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
an infrared camera or whatever or try to
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
identify people who may be able to
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
benefit from this thank you for the
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
question representative I'd like to
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
follow back up if that's all right with
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
you via email probably the same one I'll
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
send the uh to representative vos's
 
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
question um again I know Community
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
Action agencies as a lot of other people
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh face Workforce challenges I don't
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
imagine um that they're sending folks
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
out in the field to knock on doors and
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
that type of thing but to great extent
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to follow back up with you and
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
get you more spoton answer thank
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
you representative ryos has a
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
um inherent in your um testimony Mr Abes
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
the clearly the way uh the
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
existing WAP works as well as the New
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves programs are essentially
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
they are are opt in PE
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
homeowners must take the initiative
 
01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:58.750 align:start position:0%
homeowners must take the initiative
correct

01:47:58.750 --> 01:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
to apply begin the process of getting
 
01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
their property assessed for um you know
 
01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
its current state of efficiency and
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
potential assistance
 
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
um the roughly 2 million a year in
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
funding seems to be you know the way the
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
programs have run for years and then the
 
01:48:24.750 --> 01:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
onetime appropriation of $18 million
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
would have been looks like you know an
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
enormous um infl in influx of resources
 
01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:35.719 align:start position:0%
available what's the current state of
 
01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
the use of that uh $18 million where are
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
we with
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
that disposition of the 18 million and
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
and is there uh is that funding
 
01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
available sort of in perpetuity for
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
should we get more more applications
 
01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:52.030 align:start position:0%
should we get more more applications
should

01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
we uh get a lot more people applying for
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
B for the program to get assistance
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
would that $18 million be there to help
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
them sure and thank you for the question
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
so the specifically regarding the
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment jobs act
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation um that is uh an
 
01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
allocation that's made for a fiveyear
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
period so we get it all up front we have
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
five years to spend it down um uh based
 
01:49:19.390 --> 01:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
on my discussions with uh folks on our
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program team
 
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
um there might be the option to extend
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
the award period if needed if for some
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
reason we haven't drawn down the 18
 
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
million within the five-year period um
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
but obviously that is not our goal we
 
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
we'd like to spend all the money as soon
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
as possible um regarding you know I
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
think there was uh a policy effort made
 
01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
by Congress and the Biden Administration
 
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
to certainly direct um Federal funding
 
01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
toward those who you know are of limited
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
means and are certainly more subject to
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
volatile energy price swings um I think
 
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
that would you know and it's an it's
 
01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
been an existing program it's an annual
 
01:50:01.629 --> 01:50:01.639 align:start position:0%
program so I think the thought was that
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
they would inject more money into that
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
um I believe I hope I'm answering your
 
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
question I think I'm hitting all the way
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
around it uh but we certainly do um
 
01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
intend to draw down the 18 million it is
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
relatively new to the department again
 
01:50:17.229 --> 01:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
it was just um appropriate I think to us
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
just recently but I think we're in the
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
process of of drawing down those funds
 
01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you to follow up on
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
representative rol's question is the18
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
million in addition to the 2 million
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
yearly that's correct funds
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
so the 18 million divided by five is 3.6
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
million you add 2 million to that
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
there's 5.6 million available for
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
weatherization for the next five years
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
is that correct I I would say if using
 
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
your analys using your example if you
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
were to take the 18 million that we all
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
have up front divide it by five years
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
you get about 3.6 million a year
 
01:51:00.189 --> 01:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
assuming everything remains constant we
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
get roughly that $2 million
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation added on it's about four
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
to five million I guess you could say
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
each year for the next five years okay
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
good thank you representative Kaplan has
 
01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:11.830 align:start position:0%
good thank you representative Kaplan has
a

01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr robish um you
 
01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
know along the same lines so we're
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
seeing roughly a doubling of your budget
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate that that money will
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
be spent that you will have applications
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
to to to spend down that money and uh
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know a follow-up question would be
 
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
how do you interact with New Hampshire
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
safes and how does that budget compare
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire safes budget sure I
 
01:51:35.069 --> 01:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
guess three question thank you for the
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
question I think we do intend to
 
01:51:39.229 --> 01:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
certainly draw down the 18 million again
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
we never want to be in the position
 
01:51:42.189 --> 01:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
where we're sending money back to the
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
federal government and that is something
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
that WAP staff in our department work
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with staff at you know I
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
heard mentioned earlier straford County
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
cap and the other caps around the state
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
to make sure the money is being deployed
 
01:51:58.069 --> 01:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively um I've
 
01:52:00.189 --> 01:52:00.199 align:start position:0%
already spaced I'm very sorry what was
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
the second question you asked I'm
 
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
sorry how do you interact with New
 
01:52:06.069 --> 01:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves I'm sorry about that how
 
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
does that budget compare to the New
 
01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves budget sure so the New
 
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves budget is certainly uh
 
01:52:14.189 --> 01:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
larger I would say than um the
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program budget
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
um again Community Action agencies were
 
01:52:21.550 --> 01:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
work very closely with individual
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
homeowners and the contractors that they
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
have contractors with to do the work and
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
then to identify measures that would be
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
the best use of w funding versus New
 
01:52:31.629 --> 01:52:31.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves funding and they work
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
very closely with those parties to make
 
01:52:36.430 --> 01:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
sure that it all works out in the
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
end representative McGee has a question
 
01:52:41.229 --> 01:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Ro
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again um so my question
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh has to do with uh it was a question
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
that came up earlier I believe it was
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
the chair that posed it around the
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
return on investment for Energy
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
Efficiency because I believe we see
 
01:52:55.229 --> 01:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
reports all the time and certainly the
 
01:52:57.149 --> 01:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves program which is run
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
by the the uh New Hampshire utilities
 
01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
default utilities um they generally come
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
out with a report on the trienal Energy
 
01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency program New Hampshire saves
 
01:53:10.589 --> 01:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
every three years and it always covers
 
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
the return on investment which the last
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
time I saw it I think it was 3.8 so it
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
was a you know $3.8 for every dollar
 
01:53:19.229 --> 01:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
invested do you does the department of
 
01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:21.639 align:start position:0%
energy maintain that information can you
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
give us a sense of what the return on
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
investment is for the dollars that we
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
spend and the second question
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
is am I correct in understanding that
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire shaves program is
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
funded through the regional greenhouse
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
gas initiative dollars I know I know
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
that the first dollar of the auction
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
goes to Energy Efficiency that's the the
 
01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
only program that we've designed that
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
can be funded through Reggie so I'm just
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
curious is is that correct
 
01:53:52.510 --> 01:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
still correct so I'll answer the first
 
01:53:54.069 --> 01:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
one I'm going to get to the second one
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
if I lose it I'll ask you to just repeat
 
01:53:59.229 --> 01:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
it so um on your first question about uh
 
01:54:02.189 --> 01:54:02.199 align:start position:0%
reporting on cost benefit uh for WAP at
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
least specifically um again like to
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
follow up with you in the committee on
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
that I know that we have regular
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
reporting um that we report to the US
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
Department of energy on on the progress
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
of our program um I am not a WAP staffer
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to get a little bit more
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
into the weeds as to whether or not we
 
01:54:20.910 --> 01:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
report any uh return on investment
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
information to the feds I can then relay
 
01:54:26.069 --> 01:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
that on to you okay um your second
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
question uh obviously the New Hampshire
 
01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
saves program is primarily funded
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
through the system benefits charge on
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
customers bills um the regie rebates as
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
far as I understand obviously
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
everything beside everything beyond the
 
01:54:41.669 --> 01:54:41.679 align:start position:0%
first dollar of every allowance sold is
 
01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
rebed back to customers um the remaining
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
money is put into What's called the
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency fund which I believe
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
is something that new hampsh saves uses
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
um as well um again I a lot of my
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
homework today here was a little bit
 
01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
more focused on WAP again like to follow
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
up on that one and get a little bit more
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
specificity on the use of the yeah I'd
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate understanding yep how that
 
01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:05.910 align:start position:0%
appreciate understanding yep how that
works

01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
yep representative PL has a question uh
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you once again thanks again taking
 
01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
my question um since lap was funded
 
01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:17.950 align:start position:0%
my question um since lap was funded
since

01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
1976 I'm not sure how along New
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has but to your
 
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge we heard to I'm sorry backstep
 
01:55:28.069 --> 01:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
we heard today that some of the few
 
01:55:30.589 --> 01:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
assistant monies were not spent to your
 
01:55:33.709 --> 01:55:33.719 align:start position:0%
knowledge is there any other weather
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
weatherization funding that is not being
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
spent to the max sure and thank you for
 
01:55:40.109 --> 01:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
the question I think what the earlier
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
reference was getting to in terms of
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance funding I'm assuming it
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
was talking about the programs
 
01:55:47.950 --> 01:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
established under uh HB 2023 from a few
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
years ago um regarding the federal
 
01:55:52.669 --> 01:55:52.679 align:start position:0%
funding whether it's weatherization
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
assistance program or Li Heap or the
 
01:55:58.189 --> 01:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance program um those monies
 
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh tend to be drawn down every single
 
01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
year um if there's an outlier there I
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
can certainly again follow up with the
 
01:56:09.069 --> 01:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
that okay seeing no further questions
 
01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
for Mr robar question please uh
 
01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
representative McGee I just have a
 
01:56:19.229 --> 01:56:19.239 align:start position:0%
followup to representative F's question
 
01:56:19.239 --> 01:56:20.510 align:start position:0%
followup to representative F's question
um

01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
so is it safe for us to assume that
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
there is a higher demand than there is
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
funding in these programs that if we if
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
we draw down the money every year thank
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
you for the question so yeah I I would I
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
think I think that would be fair to say
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
um yes um yeah I would say it's fair to
 
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
say Obviously the amount of homes that
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
are uh weatherized every year varies
 
01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
based on program budgets and the amount
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
of uptake and everything like that one
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
home might take more funding versus
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
another home um but I would say yes
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
there there does continue to be a need
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
for um weatherization assistance program
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
funding and we certainly do deploy it to
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
the greatest extent possible thank you
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr robers for being here this
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
morning and answering our questions next
 
01:57:15.069 --> 01:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
lame good morning Mr lame and welcome to
 
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:22.229 align:start position:0%
lame good morning Mr lame and welcome to
stn

01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
don't forget to turn on the mic goodness
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for having me today I
 
01:57:27.629 --> 01:57:27.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh my name is Brandon Le
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
May uh I am from Manchester I'm also an
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
organizer with rights and democracy uh
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
just here to speak in favor of hb1 1230
 
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh and I just want to kind of uh skip up
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
some of the things that have been talked
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
before and just kind of talk about my
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
experience I do a lot of Outreach
 
01:57:44.069 --> 01:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
particularly in areas with a lot of
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
renters in
 
01:57:48.030 --> 01:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester and throughout the past
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
couple Summers haven't been able do a
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
lot of door knocking in the winters um
 
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
we've reached out to a lot of homeowners
 
01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
and also middle and low income tenants
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
who have expressed an increasing
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
struggle to be able to pay their
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
utilities and the reason why I bring
 
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
this up is because HUD defines a cost
 
01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
burdened renter if they're spending more
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
than 50% of their rent and
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
utilities on sorry 50% of their income
 
01:58:17.709 --> 01:58:17.719 align:start position:0%
on rent and utilities as well so your
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
housing costs are heavily into your your
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
utility costs and what we found is that
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of the tenants that we' spoken to
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
struggle to keep their Apartments cool
 
01:58:30.510 --> 01:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
in the summer and warm in the
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
winter and this has really I think
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
highlighted the need for a study like
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
this we need this study in order to
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
confirm what we've been seeing on the
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
ground because anecdotal evidence is
 
01:58:43.629 --> 01:58:43.639 align:start position:0%
great but we really need to figure out
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
exactly how many of these renters in
 
01:58:48.030 --> 01:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
places like Manchester are struggling to
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
keep their apartments or their homes at
 
01:58:52.109 --> 01:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
an appropriate temp uh at an appropriate
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
temperature so I feel like the study
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill would help us actually clearly know
 
01:58:58.990 --> 01:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
where the need is and then what should
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
be done about that because obviously we
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be legislating based on
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
feelings um but yeah so I am also really
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
excited about the idea of weatherization
 
01:59:12.510 --> 01:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
in general uh mostly because you know
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
this legislator is doing some great
 
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
things to incentivize more housing being
 
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
built in the future the thing about
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
housing costs is that it's going to take
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
a while to get those down it's going to
 
01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
take a while to get the supply that we
 
01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:25.639 align:start position:0%
need it's going to take a while in order
 
01:59:27.069 --> 01:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
to renovate a lot of the apartments that
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
we have but one thing that we can look
 
01:59:32.189 --> 01:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
at is if we can reduce people's utility
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
bills that's a way of bringing down
 
01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:35.560 align:start position:0%
people's housing costs and that's an
 
01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
ability for this legislator to direct or
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
legislature to directly impact people in
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
a positive way there so I'll um see the
 
01:59:44.109 --> 01:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
rest of the time that I have I'll open
 
01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
up to any questions that we
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
have questions for Mr lame
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative MC
 
01:59:54.189 --> 01:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
Williams thank you so much chair um and
 
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr lame for coming out to
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
speak with us um I guess my question is
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
i' just like to understand a little bit
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
more about how you decide which doors to
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
knock um as an Outreach piece to this uh
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you that if
 
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
weatherization and efficiency are the
 
02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
lwh hanging fruit and that's really what
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
we should be doing to address first when
 
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
it comes to cost for energy for our
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
constituents so big picture how do you
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
decide like what is there a met a matrix
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
what what are you doing to make the
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
priority choices that is a really great
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
question representative thank you so
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
much well a little bit about me is I was
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
born and raised in Manchester so I know
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
the neighborhoods really well there um
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
we also do pour over some of the uh
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
census track data that we have we track
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods uh with some of the lowest
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
income in the state in particularly in
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
Manchester as well uh we go after places
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
with people uh you know who are more
 
02:00:46.069 --> 02:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
likely to be renters so for instance 50%
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
of Manchester uh are renters and we were
 
02:00:51.069 --> 02:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
going after neighborhoods that were more
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
than 75%
 
02:00:55.229 --> 02:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
renters so a little bit of gut feeling a
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of pouring over data and uh
 
02:00:59.550 --> 02:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
combine them into an Outreach plan thank
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
you further
 
02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank
 
02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr lame for testifying here this
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
morning and call on our last speaker on
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you and that is M
 
02:01:14.189 --> 02:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
Fredericks of Durham New Hampshire
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of
 
02:01:25.069 --> 02:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
mic hit it there we are um my name is m
 
02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
friedricks um I grew up in exodar New
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and moved back to the state uh
 
02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
two years ago and now reside in Durham
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to speak on this bill today
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
because um I have um joined the the
 
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
town's elected Town Council um and did
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
that uh through my work on the planning
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
board and the energy committee and one
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the things that I learned first by
 
02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
joining the planning board um and then
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
the energy committee was the uh High
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
burden that our area residents were
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
experiencing with their utilities and
 
02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
this is in Durham which is one of the
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
States you know better off communities
 
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
um and we have neighbors who are
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
spending um 800 to over a th000 on
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
utilities a month in modest homes these
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
are retired folks um are Heating when we
 
02:02:24.669 --> 02:02:24.679 align:start position:0%
moved in was over 6,000 um a year and um
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
as I I started down this road to WEA
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
eyes our own home and try and bring
 
02:02:30.069 --> 02:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
those costs down because we knew that
 
02:02:32.669 --> 02:02:32.679 align:start position:0%
those costs were unsustainable for us as
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
um as a young couple and firsttime
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
homeowners and as we did that um we
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
really learned that uh I we were able to
 
02:02:43.470 --> 02:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
manage it for our own home but I started
 
02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
talking to many of my neighbors and many
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
of whom are elderly um and in that
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
process learning about a lot of the
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
barriers to weatherization sometimes
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
small things like in order for New
 
02:02:54.669 --> 02:02:54.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves to come in and do the
 
02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
work they have to move all of the items
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
in their basement away from the
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
foundation walls and they elderly folks
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
who can't do that physically anymore um
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
or can't between the caretaking
 
02:03:06.589 --> 02:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that one has for the
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
other who's now severely disabled and I
 
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
think that this sort of a committee
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
could really help to identify some of
 
02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
those burdens um and the more that uh we
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
talked about this as an energy committee
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
um in Durham but also the energy
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
committees across towns are quite well
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
connected um and and have kind of a list
 
02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
serve and meet periodically and what
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
we're you know what what I remember
 
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
hearing from all these other towns is
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
that folks are not only focused on
 
02:03:35.709 --> 02:03:35.719 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings and their energy
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
committees that really across the state
 
02:03:39.149 --> 02:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
people are concerned about helping
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
residents to weatherize their own homes
 
02:03:45.189 --> 02:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
to bring those costs down um and they're
 
02:03:47.069 --> 02:03:47.079 align:start position:0%
trying to understand and get information
 
02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
out but I think that they're they're is
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
a gap in understanding you know um what
 
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
is the the unmet demand and how do we
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
reach all the people who need assistance
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
and so in the own you know our own
 
02:03:59.950 --> 02:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
research for the town of durhams energy
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
committee um we actually are looking at
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
founding a nonprofit in order to help
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
residents navigate this process because
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
we do see that there are such great um
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
gaps in needs um within our own
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
residents and we spoke with the straford
 
02:04:17.709 --> 02:04:17.719 align:start position:0%
county cap um and learned that one in 16
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
homes in straford county is on the
 
02:04:22.990 --> 02:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance weight list
 
02:04:24.669 --> 02:04:24.679 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons that there are I
 
02:04:27.629 --> 02:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
mean that's one of all 16 home that's an
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
incredible figure to me um but one of
 
02:04:31.229 --> 02:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
the reasons for that is that there's
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes also a mismatch between how
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
the funding can be used and um some
 
02:04:39.310 --> 02:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
pre-existing delayed maintenance issues
 
02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
um so just hearing that figure that
 
02:04:43.870 --> 02:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
demand is so high and seeing the
 
02:04:46.030 --> 02:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
statistics for the amount of fuel
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
assistance and electric assistance that
 
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
is going out it seems to me um to
 
02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
be almost irresponsible with taxpayers
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
money frankly um to not to be continuing
 
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
to fund the fuel assistance and electric
 
02:05:02.830 --> 02:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
assistance which we absolutely need we
 
02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
we do not want people suffering in
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
unheated homes but to do so without
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
examining you know why are these
 
02:05:11.549 --> 02:05:11.559 align:start position:0%
buildings using so much heat and energy
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
and what are we doing to improve that
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
situation because we could be providing
 
02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
F assistance fuel assistance for 10
 
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
years at the you know more than $6,000 a
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
year because we're not doing
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
weatherization work and that that
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense to me um and
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
similarly with housing we are you know
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
we've recognized this urgent need for
 
02:05:32.189 --> 02:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
housing and this huge um need for
 
02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and um speaking with
 
02:05:37.549 --> 02:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
you know I've been following that issue
 
02:05:39.310 --> 02:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
as someone on my Town Council and
 
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
planning board and hearing from
 
02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
different nonprofits across the state
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they recognize is
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
the energy burden and the fact that
 
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
utilities are making up a significant
 
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
part of cost for some households um and
 
02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
to not acknowledge that in our housing
 
02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
crisis means also that we are putting
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
out money um you know taxpayer funding
 
02:06:00.270 --> 02:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
to deal with the housing situation and
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
try and address that but the utility
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
component needs to be addressed within
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
that because that's part of the equation
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
and so any responsible use of taxpayer
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
money to be funding things like invest
 
02:06:13.069 --> 02:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should be looking at
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
utilities as well because that's a
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
significant part of the housing cost um
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
so that's just I I wanted to come and
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
share um what I felt like I had learned
 
02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
um from working in my local Municipal
 
02:06:27.790 --> 02:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
level um and connecting with other towns
 
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
across the state so thank you thank you
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%

Doug
 
02:06:36.189 --> 02:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:06:39.149 --> 02:06:39.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just for my own
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
clarification when you mentioned that
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
you have uh constituents that are paying
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
$800 to $1,000 a month on utilities
 
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
would you please define what utilities
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
um are composed of is it electric fuel
 
02:06:56.189 --> 02:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
water or what what what does that figure
 
02:06:58.750 --> 02:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
consist of um so in talking with them
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
that was just for heating costs but I
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
just heating I broaden it to um
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
utilities because it kind of varied on
 
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
what their heating source is we have
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
people who are using electric resistance
 
02:07:10.750 --> 02:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
heat we have folks on propane we have
 
02:07:13.549 --> 02:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
folks on heating oil um we don't have
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
very many folks on natural gas as I
 
02:07:17.910 --> 02:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
think is the case for most um most of
 
02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we do have folks using
 
02:07:22.589 --> 02:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
firewood um so just from having spoken
 
02:07:25.870 --> 02:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
with various Neighbors in that context
 
02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
follow follow up thank you and just to
 
02:07:33.069 --> 02:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
tag on um with your experience let's
 
02:07:38.549 --> 02:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
focus on electric uh um assistance I I
 
02:07:41.709 --> 02:07:41.719 align:start position:0%
happen to know a person who um is well
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
below the poverty level in terms of uh
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh yearly income applies for electric uh
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
assistance and gets a whopping $9 a
 
02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
month taking off the electric bill have
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
you found that to be a similar case in
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
Durham people applying and getting
 
02:07:59.430 --> 02:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
really not much for their work for
 
02:08:02.430 --> 02:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
filling out applications um I haven't
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
followed through with that to work with
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
people on getting the assistance um I've
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
connected more with them on the
 
02:08:09.709 --> 02:08:09.719 align:start position:0%
weatherization and looking at New
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves so I I've just shared
 
02:08:13.470 --> 02:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
them their information with cap and I'm
 
02:08:15.270 --> 02:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid I can't offer any insight
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
onto that your question sorry
 
02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Miss
 
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
Frederick for taking my question um it
 
02:08:27.709 --> 02:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
sounds to me as though you're pretty
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
involved and pretty aware so when you
 
02:08:33.629 --> 02:08:33.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned your own um your own uh
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
utility bill that was not going to be
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
sustainable I'm wondering if you've
 
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
taken any action and if so how much it
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
might have cut uh that $6,000 bill that
 
02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
you alluded to just curious yeah um sure
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
so we um did we signed up through New
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves and we had some
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
weatherization work done um and we also
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
realized that our while our boiler was
 
02:08:58.030 --> 02:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
still functioning um it was incredibly
 
02:08:59.470 --> 02:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
inefficient and that was one of the
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
causes for our High um heaing costs and
 
02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
so um we've started to do um part of our
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
home with heat pumps we couldn't afford
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
to do all of it um but our monthly bill
 
02:09:15.549 --> 02:09:15.559 align:start position:0%
um it's a little tricky because electric
 
02:09:19.069 --> 02:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
costs have gone up so much um but I
 
02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
would say that um last winter our
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
monthly bill went up for maybe 150
 
02:09:27.549 --> 02:09:27.559 align:start position:0%
electric with you know no electric heat
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
to about 300 with the heat pumps and we
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
are still continuing to occasionally use
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
um our wood pellets well we we use our
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
wood pellet stove and occasionally um
 
02:09:41.310 --> 02:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
some of the the uh original system that
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
uses the boiler uses heating oil um and
 
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
so adding it all together um um I would
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
guess that it's you know probably safely
 
02:09:56.549 --> 02:09:56.559 align:start position:0%
under $400 a month in the winter um and
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
if we go you know that's six month uh a
 
02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
year um that we heat in our home we we
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
keep it cool in October and May so 2400
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
now I would say a year versus 6,000 when
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
we first moved in it's a pretty big
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
difference we're starting to wander a
 
02:10:15.629 --> 02:10:15.639 align:start position:0%
little bit from the subject of the bill
 
02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
so please keep confine your questions to
 
02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
this study committee Bill representative
 
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
m Fredericks for coming in um in line
 
02:10:28.830 --> 02:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
with uh my comment to representative
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
grassy that this is as much a housing
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
problem as it is a weatherization
 
02:10:34.109 --> 02:10:34.119 align:start position:0%
problem I'm just curious uh about the
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
thing you mentioned about delayed
 
02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance that you found that a lot of
 
02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
the houses uh were unable to take up the
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
weatherization uh projects that they
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
were offered because of delayed
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance so I was wondering what sort
 
02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:46.559 align:start position:0%
what extent of delayed maintenance that
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh that entailed because my experience
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
once you start trying to improve a house
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
you find that the problem sometimes is
 
02:10:55.229 --> 02:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
much bigger than originally you uh
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
envisioned so what what what is do you
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
have an idea of what the extent of that
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
delayed maintenance is what kind of
 
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
problems they they uh they are and also
 
02:11:05.549 --> 02:11:05.559 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the houses on your
 
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
waiting list that you mentioned would be
 
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
would would fall under this category of
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
of houses that have delayed maintenance
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
issues thank you um so that information
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
came from a a conversation with the St
 
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
for cap um weatherization assistance
 
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
programs director um who I found was was
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
extremely useful um and you know that
 
02:11:29.790 --> 02:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
information about the one in6 homes in
 
02:11:31.229 --> 02:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
the county overall so there over I think
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
it's over than 5,000 homes that are on
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
the wait list right now for straford
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
County Alone um and the examples that he
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
gave and I apologize that I don't
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
remember on the spot his name but um I'd
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
be happy to try and find that or I'm
 
02:11:47.229 --> 02:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
sure you could find it on the website um
 
02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
the examples that he gave were primarily
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
roof repairs um that they couldn't go in
 
02:11:53.470 --> 02:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
and do additional insulation with the
 
02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
the roof needing repair and they didn't
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
have the funding to repair the roof and
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
so what straford cap was doing was
 
02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
trying to actually individually fundrise
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
fundraise for those homes as part of
 
02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
their nonprofit fundraising their annual
 
02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
fundraising and do um specific projects
 
02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
to try and help help um home by home
 
02:12:12.669 --> 02:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
make improvements but obviously that
 
02:12:15.669 --> 02:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
that is extremely slow goinging um and
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
so they just have kind of an increasing
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
backlog in terms of the the homes that
 
02:12:25.229 --> 02:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
assistance okay seeing no further
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
questions we want to thank you Miss
 
02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
friedricks for testifying here this
 
02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
morning and thank you with no other pink
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
cards extent for this public hearing I'm
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'm going to ask
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative plog to give us
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
information about the blue sheet on this
 
02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
Bill if you have
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
it um not at this moment shair okay
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
we'll call for that later then and in
 
02:13:03.229 --> 02:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
the meantime I'm going to open a public
 
02:13:06.430 --> 02:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
1289 establishing a commission to study
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
the replacement of the peer plant in bow
 
02:13:14.350 --> 02:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
with a clean energy base load generator
 
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
and storage and I'm going to call on the
 
02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
bills Prime sponsor Jared Wheeler to
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
introduce introduce this
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
legislation representative wheeler
 
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
welcome to sence technology and energy
 
02:13:30.629 --> 02:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:13:33.549 --> 02:13:33.559 align:start position:0%
committee uh I am late for work so I'm
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
going to be as brief as I can um I
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
introduced this legislation
 
02:13:41.229 --> 02:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
here m mostly because and I got a call
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
from the lobbyist uh a couple of weeks
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
after I had requested the LSR saying
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
that they were totally compliant with
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
the regulation and it's not for me about
 
02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're compliant with
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
the regulation for me it's about the
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
material that they're burning at the
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
plant um a large amount of federal
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
funding right now is available for uh
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
moving coal plants and other uh fossil
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
fuel plants in a just way towards uh
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energies and other things and
 
02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
and that funding is only available for a
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
certain period of time and chairman Vose
 
02:14:19.549 --> 02:14:19.559 align:start position:0%
as you and I have discussed uh after uh
 
02:14:23.229 --> 02:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
uh before session the other day um the
 
02:14:26.830 --> 02:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
bo Co plant is is set to expire in 20126
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
that set to to close um my opinion on it
 
02:14:33.069 --> 02:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
and and why i' I've still chose to come
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
forward and and support this legislation
 
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
is that despite the fact that it is set
 
02:14:39.669 --> 02:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
to close I think that it would be uh
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
beneficial for not just the uh
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
legislature and and the New Hampshire
 
02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
state government but the the people of
 
02:14:48.669 --> 02:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
Bo to have a comprehensive commission
 
02:14:51.149 --> 02:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
that includes uh everyone who would be
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
involved in uh that transition including
 
02:14:57.149 --> 02:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
the workers the the the the uh owners of
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
the plant the community in Bow um and
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
obviously throughout the process of of
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
the plant closing that there will be
 
02:15:06.430 --> 02:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the public to provide
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
input to the company I think that it's
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh a good example of of what we can do
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
here in the legislature to have that
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive commission that that
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
addresses that issue uh uh in a deep and
 
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
and well processed way with all of those
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders at the same table instead
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
of uh one onone conversations one at a
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
time um coal and its harms uh uh the
 
02:15:36.589 --> 02:15:36.599 align:start position:0%
evidence for me is in um and there is
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
specific evidence that I will provide to
 
02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
the committee in my WR email testimony
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
after this uh linked to higher mercury
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
levels cancer asthma premature deaths
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
and people with heart
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
and lung disease in b um so this is
 
02:15:53.430 --> 02:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
something that is directly affecting the
 
02:15:56.350 --> 02:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
people of bow and uh in one hour the
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
plant emits more CO2 than than the
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
average American does in 26 years of
 
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
life so so as much as you know people
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
are trying to get us to use plastic
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
straws and and the individual
 
02:16:10.109 --> 02:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility aspect of of where we're
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
at with climate change I think it's it's
 
02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
examples like this where you have uh a
 
02:16:18.589 --> 02:16:18.599 align:start position:0%
beaker plant uh uh producing more CO2
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
than one person does in 26 years and in
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
one hour of of it producing uh its its
 
02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
energy and so you know to bring it back
 
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
to why now I think it's just important
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
uh given the fact that the plant is
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
commissioned to set to be decommissioned
 
02:16:39.309 --> 02:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
by 26 to have a comprehensive commission
 
02:16:42.629 --> 02:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
that addresses this issue um and as I
 
02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
said I'll try to be as quick as possible
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to take uh uh uh any
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
number of questions that you have I know
 
02:16:49.230 --> 02:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
that there are other people who are
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
testifying who will be able to answer
 
02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
those questions as well but that uh
 
02:16:55.469 --> 02:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
essentially is why I brought this bill
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
and I thank you Mr chairman for the
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on it thank you
 
02:17:01.469 --> 02:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler and uh members of
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
the committee being sensitive to
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler need to get to
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
work um be careful with your
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Thomas has Doug
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
02:17:19.709 --> 02:17:19.719 align:start position:0%
as I look at your bill here uh it
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
focuses on replacing the peer power or
 
02:17:26.589 --> 02:17:26.599 align:start position:0%
the power plant with a clean energy
 
02:17:26.599 --> 02:17:27.549 align:start position:0%
the power plant with a clean energy
power

02:17:27.549 --> 02:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
power
 
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
generator um knowing or perhaps you know
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm I'm not aware of any clean
 
02:17:40.030 --> 02:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
energy generator that would generate uh
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
the Lost uh megawatts coming from the
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
footprint that the current plant now
 
02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:48.990 align:start position:0%
footprint that the current plant now
occupies

02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
occupies
 
02:17:54.990 --> 02:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
um so would instead of focusing on um
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
clean energy in General on on the on the
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
study committee uh perhaps uh just a uh
 
02:18:07.629 --> 02:18:07.639 align:start position:0%
a review or a study on what could be
 
02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
placed there instead of the current
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
plant to generate an equal or more
 
02:18:15.309 --> 02:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
amount of megawatts that would be lost
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
because peer power plants are very
 
02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
important during
 
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
periods like this and we need to be able
 
02:18:22.549 --> 02:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
to generate almost
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
instantaneously um uh Power that would
 
02:18:27.870 --> 02:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
be needed on a a moment's notice is that
 
02:18:29.469 --> 02:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
something that you would consider or
 
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
what other type of form could be studied
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm definitely open to anything that
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
we can achieve which Mak sure that we
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
can uh uh meet Peak demand when it comes
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
to our energy grid um I guess the
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
concern that I would have with opening
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
it up too much is I also have a concern
 
02:18:47.709 --> 02:18:47.719 align:start position:0%
with with natural gas and and how how
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's purported I mean I'm not uh a
 
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
scientist and that's why I'm not on
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
science energy and Technology but I
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
think that there are conversations that
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
should be had around nuclear energy you
 
02:19:00.589 --> 02:19:00.599 align:start position:0%
know keeping in mind the the concerns
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
that people have but um I think that uh
 
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
there should be a comprehensive
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
conversation about uh the peer plant and
 
02:19:09.790 --> 02:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
and and for me it's um I hear that
 
02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599 align:start position:0%
concern but it is more about the fact
 
02:19:13.309 --> 02:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
that they're using
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
coal representative Harrington has a
 
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you and thank you for
 
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question question uh as I
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
assume you're aware that there is a
 
02:19:22.429 --> 02:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place in New Hampshire and
 
02:19:24.669 --> 02:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
New England to build power plants uh
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
people build them they've been building
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
them for years and we've gone to a
 
02:19:30.150 --> 02:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
deregulated structure where we have
 
02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
Merchant plants where private uh
 
02:19:35.469 --> 02:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
companies decide to finance they sign
 
02:19:37.870 --> 02:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
contracts and then they for power
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
production and they build plants uh so
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
what I assume you're proposing here is a
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
replacement to that where somehow the
 
02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
government's going to get in and finance
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
this or or mandate that a plan can't be
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
built there because there's no
 
02:19:50.590 --> 02:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
prohibition right now unless you know
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
something I don't that would prohibit
 
02:19:55.710 --> 02:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
anybody from building wind or solar
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
whatever clean energy you want at that
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
site no I the the legislation isn't a
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
mandate or or a government enforcement
 
02:20:07.150 --> 02:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
saying that you must it's a a commission
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
with the stakeholders involved in the
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
plan including the owners uh about what
 
02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:13.750 align:start position:0%
plan including the owners uh about what
could

02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
be follow up really quick so what you're
 
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
saying is the present process where
 
02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
markets are all to do this doesn't work
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
you're substituting some government form
 
02:20:25.790 --> 02:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
of commission to come up with an
 
02:20:27.630 --> 02:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
alternate method from the way we build
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
power plants now well what I'd say to
 
02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
that and you know I don't want to get
 
02:20:32.190 --> 02:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
into a discussion about markets and
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
their impact on on the energy grid but I
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
I you know I have my opinions on that
 
02:20:37.630 --> 02:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
but I I what I would say is that I think
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes the market despite being
 
02:20:41.309 --> 02:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
important and an important piece of the
 
02:20:44.110 --> 02:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
economy can leave conversations like the
 
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
environment and its impacts on uh people
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
in the community and their health uh by
 
02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
the wayside and that's when it's
 
02:20:52.030 --> 02:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
important for for public entities in the
 
02:20:54.389 --> 02:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
public uh sector to step in and have
 
02:20:56.190 --> 02:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
commissions like this to study the
 
02:20:57.870 --> 02:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
impact of its health and and
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
Replacements that could be there to make
 
02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
sure that uh people can participate in
 
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
the market um without cancer
 
02:21:07.309 --> 02:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative liwicki has a question uh
 
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:21:11.790 --> 02:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
representative um one thing I notice in
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
the U membership of the uh proposed
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
committee is that ownership is not there
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
and this would seem to me to be an
 
02:21:22.270 --> 02:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
oversight would you be open to amending
 
02:21:24.510 --> 02:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
to have ownership of the plant be
 
02:21:27.550 --> 02:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
involved happy to I'm absolutely open to
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment then on that
 
02:21:32.670 --> 02:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative Wendy Thomas
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair um you
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
may be aware that in the town of marac
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
we have a dirty corporation that is
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
closing down that being St gobain uh
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
Dees is very involved in the oversight
 
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
of of this closing specifically with
 
02:21:49.950 --> 02:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
regards to environmental toxins do you
 
02:21:53.429 --> 02:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
see Dees playing a role in in this
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
committee um in the process going
 
02:21:57.950 --> 02:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
forward for this yeah absolutely I would
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
hope that Dees would show up when the
 
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
committee would ask it to and and
 
02:22:03.990 --> 02:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
participate uh as much as possible and
 
02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
and uh I think Dees has you know shown
 
02:22:10.110 --> 02:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
its its uh willingness to do so and and
 
02:22:12.910 --> 02:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah my short and direct answer to
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
that would be absolutely yeah thank
 
02:22:19.070 --> 02:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:22:23.550 --> 02:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
you representative wheeler for being
 
02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
here the bill as written doesn't
 
02:22:28.590 --> 02:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
actually say that the replacement should
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
be at the same location as the current
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
plant and the
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
current uh location of the plant
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
certainly imposes some limitations on
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
what could replace it I can't imagine
 
02:22:43.870 --> 02:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
say a wind farm going right in there or
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
even um a solar array big enough to
 
02:22:48.910 --> 02:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
replace what's there would you be open
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
to the idea of replacing this plant with
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
something somewhere else I think that's
 
02:22:55.870 --> 02:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
a great idea representative Corman and
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
that might allow for uh you know
 
02:23:00.429 --> 02:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
alleviating representative Thomas's
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
concern where we could find a clean
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
energy replacement that meets the peak
 
02:23:09.630 --> 02:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire additional questions
 
02:23:14.269 --> 02:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan thank you Mr chair
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative wheeler for
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
for coming in with this bill
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
um you know you've heard some feedback
 
02:23:22.510 --> 02:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
on maybe the language being a little bit
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
focused and and and uh you've said that
 
02:23:26.349 --> 02:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
you don't really have an idea in mind
 
02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to mandate uh is it
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
fair to say and that your main intent is
 
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
to provide the the community and the
 
02:23:35.429 --> 02:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
town of Bo and the state of New
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with some input into the
 
02:23:39.550 --> 02:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
process of transition in this plan and
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's really what you're trying
 
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
to that's really your concern with this
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislation yes thank you representative
 
02:23:46.710 --> 02:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
Kaplan I think that's well put and I
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
think um there's many examples of uh you
 
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
know environmental projects here in New
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that uh where if the public
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel adequately involved then
 
02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
things can kind of blow up and and we've
 
02:24:00.750 --> 02:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
seen that here in the legislature with
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh um landfill sightings and other
 
02:24:04.389 --> 02:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
things like that so I think it' be good
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
before that process begins to to make
 
02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
sure that the public is involved and and
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
avoid any explosion like we've seen on
 
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
on other ends like
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
that okay seeing no further questions uh
 
02:24:18.190 --> 02:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
let's let representative wheeler get to
 
02:24:22.269 --> 02:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
work and I'll call next on
 
02:24:25.710 --> 02:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
Matt por Nick kesu and I hope I
 
02:24:29.469 --> 02:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
pronounced that correctly uh
 
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
Matt yes thank you for having me uh it's
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
Peru I don't have that much time because
 
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
I have to get back to school uh but I I
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
just want to start off by saying that my
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
my family immigrated to New Hampshire
 
02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
about 30 years ago and they they they
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
sought to be a a legacy in in the United
 
02:24:45.790 --> 02:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
States and I feel that I I will no
 
02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
longer be able to continue this Legacy
 
02:24:50.590 --> 02:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for my kids if the
 
02:24:53.309 --> 02:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
environmental issues persist I stand
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
before you you all today to express my
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
support for hb1 1289 as it pertains to
 
02:25:00.510 --> 02:25:00.520 align:start position:0%

years these places have deteriorated
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
with increased rainfall and and warmer
 
02:25:48.190 --> 02:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
Winters I want the best life for my kids
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
as as my my father did before me and his
 
02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
father had before
 
02:25:54.190 --> 02:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
him but it has become clear that New
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is slowly becoming dangerous
 
02:25:59.269 --> 02:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
and inhabitable once a place my family
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
found prosperity and Solace now filled
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
with pollution from place like the
 
02:26:06.750 --> 02:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
maramax station coal plant a catalyst
 
02:26:10.349 --> 02:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
for higher mercury levels cancer rates
 
02:26:10.359 --> 02:26:11.349 align:start position:0%
for higher mercury levels cancer rates
asthma

02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
asthma
 
02:26:13.950 --> 02:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
rates and premature death with people of
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
heart or lung
 
02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
disease nonetheless the issue of
 
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
pollution exists in New Hampshire during
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
my parents generation but not to the
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
extent of today as a member of the Next
 
02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
Generation New Hampshire what will be
 
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
our next step should we advocate for
 
02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
solutions to pollution or do as those
 
02:26:31.389 --> 02:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
before us and pass the constantly
 
02:26:33.309 --> 02:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
growing burden of pollution on onto our
 
02:26:35.389 --> 02:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
children's shoulders I say began to
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the issue of
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
pollution through forming a commission
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
for clean energy prospects at the marac
 
02:26:43.870 --> 02:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
station coal plant to help create a
 
02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
legacy of pro progress for the future
 
02:26:47.950 --> 02:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
generations of new New Hampshire in
 
02:26:49.870 --> 02:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
summary New Hampshire has been affected
 
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
by the dangers of fossil fuel pollutions
 
02:26:53.790 --> 02:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
for many years and it is imperative that
 
02:26:55.630 --> 02:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
a commission is form regarding a TR
 
02:26:58.030 --> 02:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
Traditions to clean energy and Prospect
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
for the future of the marama coal plant
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
as well as the input of of the public in
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
Bow thank you for this opportunity to
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
testify thank you very much we
 
02:27:09.269 --> 02:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming in to speak with
 
02:27:09.279 --> 02:27:10.230 align:start position:0%

today representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chair it's
 
02:27:16.429 --> 02:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
actually just a comment I just wanted to
 
02:27:18.670 --> 02:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the time uh from
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
your school day to advocate for a better
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
climate future thank
 
02:27:25.630 --> 02:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions
 
02:27:28.670 --> 02:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
we'll call next
 
02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
on Martha may Emerson who's here to
 
02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
represent herself and I would remind
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
everyone that we're not here to discuss
 
02:27:42.510 --> 02:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
the future of New Hampshire's climate or
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
the climate of the planet we're here to
 
02:27:47.950 --> 02:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
discuss a bill to set up a commission to
 
02:27:49.950 --> 02:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
study the replacement of the peer plant
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
in blow in Bow so I would ask you to
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
restrict your comments to
 
02:27:59.429 --> 02:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
the study commission bill in front of us
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
and with that I'd like to welcome you
 
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
miss Emerson to sdn thank you very much
 
02:28:07.469 --> 02:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of this
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm Martha may
 
02:28:14.269 --> 02:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
Emerson thank
 
02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
you um I'm Martha may Emerson from
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
conquered I live in the south end and um
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
what I would like to speak to is the
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
effect of this on personal lives um in
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but particularly in areas
 
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
close to the plant um I live 5.1 miles
 
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
from this plant and um the intensity of
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
pollution from the plant certainly is um
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
extends most intensely for a three mile
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
radius around the plant but there's no
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
wall there that keeps that pollution
 
02:28:59.269 --> 02:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
from extending the the emissions from
 
02:29:02.790 --> 02:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
the plant extending further so um in
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
terms of conquered in terms of all
 
02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
neighboring communities in terms of
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
cities across our state the pollution um
 
02:29:16.590 --> 02:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
from the the stacks of the bow plant can
 
02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
extend up to 100 miles and so that is an
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
effect that certainly
 
02:29:26.670 --> 02:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
impacts all of our state as well as
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
neighboring states so um chairman Vos
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
has expressed um a a recommendation that
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
we not speak to the future of um
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
pollution resulting from the power plant
 
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
um so I will I will try to um reframe
 
02:29:49.870 --> 02:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
the scope of my remarks and terms of
 
02:29:53.550 --> 02:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
that request um
 
02:29:56.670 --> 02:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
specifically the bow power plant is an
 
02:29:59.710 --> 02:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
old plant built in the
 
02:30:04.590 --> 02:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
1960s um it has demonstrated in the
 
02:30:09.710 --> 02:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
recent um past year um during um an
 
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
emissions test required by its
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
permitting that um last February after
 
02:30:19.630 --> 02:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
that emissions test the results showed
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
that the plant was um emitting pollution
 
02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:26.510 align:start position:0%
that the plant was um emitting pollution
at

02:30:26.510 --> 02:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:30:31.990 --> 02:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
73% over the requirements that it its
 
02:30:35.230 --> 02:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
permit allows for
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
emissions um because of that there was
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
um a retest requirement for the plant
 
02:30:49.469 --> 02:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
which um the retest happened actually
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
three times um not until October
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
November and
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
December the October retest as you may
 
02:31:02.830 --> 02:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
well know um was there were no results
 
02:31:06.990 --> 02:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
it had to be discontinued because of
 
02:31:09.710 --> 02:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
equipment failure boilers
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
leaking there was a second retest in
 
02:31:16.830 --> 02:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
November and again it was not completed
 
02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
because of equipment malfunction and
 
02:31:19.359 --> 02:31:21.070 align:start position:0%
because of equipment malfunction and
leaking

02:31:21.070 --> 02:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
leaking
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
boilers the third retest in December
 
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
that also is not completed and no um
 
02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
nothing was revealed in terms of
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
why there has yet to be another retest
 
02:31:40.870 --> 02:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled um to see if this is a
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
functioning plant in spite of all of
 
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
this the plant was online during the
 
02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:50.670 align:start position:0%
this the plant was online during the
past

02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:31:50.680 --> 02:31:52.590 align:start position:0%
past
summer

02:31:52.590 --> 02:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
summer
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
um I can I can go on with a couple of
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
other pieces of information that I think
 
02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
um really indicate the necessity to move
 
02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
quickly on not continuing the operation
 
02:32:09.150 --> 02:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
of the bow power plant in August of last
 
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
year New Hampshire Department of energy
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
um of of Environmental Services excuse
 
02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
me informed the plants owners the
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
granite Shore power that its permit
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
breaches met criteria for federally
 
02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:26.230 align:start position:0%
breaches met criteria for federally
reportable

02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
reportable
 
02:32:29.070 --> 02:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
violations which can result in fines and
 
02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:34.510 align:start position:0%
 
EPA

02:32:34.510 --> 02:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
EPA
 
02:32:37.670 --> 02:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't know there's a lot of
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
evidence that we need to do something
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
and in part because of the age of the
 
02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
power plant as mentioned by
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler there is at this
 
02:32:52.190 --> 02:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
time um Federal funding available on
 
02:32:56.510 --> 02:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
first come first serve basis to
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
decommission coal power plants and to
 
02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
replace them with clean energy
 
02:33:06.990 --> 02:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
sources uh I think that's a real
 
02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity here and I would
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
encourage that um we move as Expedition
 
02:33:20.190 --> 02:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
as possible to bring this this bill
 
02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
forward and to act on it so that people
 
02:33:29.950 --> 02:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire can benefit from this
 
02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
federally supported
 
02:33:35.710 --> 02:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
funding to accomplish the goal of what
 
02:33:38.429 --> 02:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
is inevitable the closing of the plan
 
02:33:42.670 --> 02:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
and to support replacing it with what we
 
02:33:46.110 --> 02:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
I think all agree um as in repres
 
02:33:48.510 --> 02:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
representative Wheeler's comments that
 
02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
we need Peak energy
 
02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
plans okay well thank you very much for
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
coming to talk to us this morning it was
 
02:34:00.429 --> 02:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
nice to meet you we have questions from
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
Miss Emerson representative McGee thank
 
02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for coming
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
to speak with us today um I think we can
 
02:34:10.510 --> 02:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
all agree there's some certainly some
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
Merit to the bill but the question has
 
02:34:15.349 --> 02:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
already come up around sort of where the
 
02:34:18.030 --> 02:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
oness in terms of how the plant is going
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
to be transitioned have you heard at all
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
of any plans from Granite Shore power
 
02:34:25.710 --> 02:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
because I I I think the owners of the
 
02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
plant are actually more aware than any
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
of us about the pressure to transition
 
02:34:34.110 --> 02:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
with the closing coming up and I think
 
02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
part of the problem is that the public
 
02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
is not aware of any efforts to
 
02:34:39.710 --> 02:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
transition the plant to a you know a
 
02:34:41.469 --> 02:34:41.479 align:start position:0%
cleaner more
 
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable um energy source energy
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
asset if you will um so I'm just just
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have heard anything in
 
02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
in the energy space or the public space
 
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
or where you live about Granite Shore
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
Powers efforts to try and come up with a
 
02:34:59.790 --> 02:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
plan that will meet the federal
 
02:35:01.710 --> 02:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
expectations around transitioning away
 
02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:35:05.269 --> 02:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
coal thank you for your question
 
02:35:09.710 --> 02:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative McGee um unfortunately
 
02:35:12.510 --> 02:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
no I wish I could say oh yeah they're on
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
it um and um plans are are
 
02:35:20.070 --> 02:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
in underway um they aren't even
 
02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
responding in my view responsibly to
 
02:35:27.550 --> 02:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
some of the problems that are violating
 
02:35:32.110 --> 02:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
their permits right now um so I guess
 
02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's my answer not answering your
 
02:35:36.590 --> 02:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
question specifically but answering with
 
02:35:39.990 --> 02:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
their lack of inaction yes thank you
 
02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:41.269 align:start position:0%
their lack of inaction yes thank you
thank

02:35:41.269 --> 02:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:35:44.510 --> 02:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
you seeing uh representative Wendy
 
02:35:46.190 --> 02:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr Mr
 
02:35:48.870 --> 02:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm just curious you said you
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
live in conquered and or you live five
 
02:35:53.790 --> 02:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
miles from the plant the plant um are
 
02:35:56.230 --> 02:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
you aware of any water reports that
 
02:36:00.030 --> 02:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
identify contamination in the water and
 
02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
if so are these reports that could be
 
02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
gathered for this committee that's
 
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
something I certainly have thought of um
 
02:36:11.389 --> 02:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
I'm very green at testifying and um did
 
02:36:14.510 --> 02:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
not have an opportunity to U go through
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
all the bullet points that I want wanted
 
02:36:18.590 --> 02:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
to particularly in terms of
 
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
contacting um the the folks who are the
 
02:36:26.469 --> 02:36:26.479 align:start position:0%
Waterworks of conquered um we do have an
 
02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
open water source Penacook Lake as the
 
02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
city water supply and um you know not
 
02:36:38.830 --> 02:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
only what's up there is coming down
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's on the playgrounds or
 
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
Memorial Field or um all over
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
this region extending potentially out to
 
02:36:53.830 --> 02:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
100 miles from the plant um depending on
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
the Wind where it's blowing so no I I
 
02:36:58.750 --> 02:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
don't have that but it is something that
 
02:37:01.790 --> 02:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
I intend to follow up on thank you very
 
02:37:04.230 --> 02:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
much okay seeing no further questions I
 
02:37:05.790 --> 02:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for coming to talk to
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
us this morning and I'm going to call on
 
02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
the next person who would like to speak
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
with us and that is Shantel Ryu of
 
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:19.070 align:start position:0%
with us and that is Shantel Ryu of
gtown

02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:21.070 --> 02:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
I would remind you that we're here to
 
02:37:24.750 --> 02:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
discuss a bill to create a commission to
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
study replacing the plant in Bow we're
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
not here to discuss climate change or
 
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
pollution or matters of that
 
02:37:40.510 --> 02:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
nature thank you you've got it thank you
 
02:37:42.990 --> 02:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
um good morning um SE science technology
 
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
and energy committee and uh thank you
 
02:37:46.670 --> 02:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
for being here today to learn more about
 
02:37:48.630 --> 02:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
these proposals and to hear from our
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
community um my name is Shantel Ryu I am
 
02:37:54.429 --> 02:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
a fourth generation Granite Stater aside
 
02:37:56.590 --> 02:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
from a brief stint that I spent on the
 
02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
west coast I have spent most of my 31
 
02:38:01.790 --> 02:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
years here in Southern New Hampshire um
 
02:38:04.150 --> 02:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
for 30 of those 31 years I had no idea
 
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
that I was living Downstream always a
 
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
town or two away from the marac power
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
Generating Station in Bow um upon
 
02:38:12.269 --> 02:38:12.279 align:start position:0%
learning about the station I started
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
researching the effects of burning coal
 
02:38:17.389 --> 02:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
and the continuous use of fuels um
 
02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
coming to understand how our direct
 
02:38:21.550 --> 02:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
environment is impacted here in New
 
02:38:25.150 --> 02:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the as you've heard I think
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
from several people um a great statistic
 
02:38:30.790 --> 02:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
and I think it warrants just hearing
 
02:38:34.349 --> 02:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
again um you know the station does
 
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
create negative health and environmental
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
impacts while operating at full capacity
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
it does emit
 
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
CO2 um more CO2 in an hour than an
 
02:38:44.550 --> 02:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
average American does in 26 years as
 
02:38:46.349 --> 02:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
someone who has lived with asthma for
 
02:38:48.630 --> 02:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
most of their life I am concerned about
 
02:38:50.670 --> 02:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
that specific statistic and that's why
 
02:38:53.070 --> 02:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
it sticks out to me um especially when I
 
02:38:55.469 --> 02:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
live in such close proximity to this
 
02:38:57.790 --> 02:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
plant that being said I can certainly
 
02:38:59.349 --> 02:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
see why New Hampshire's natural
 
02:39:01.469 --> 02:39:01.479 align:start position:0%
resources way of life and tourism are
 
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
being threatened by the environmental
 
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
impact with increasingly warm Winters
 
02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
and property damaging floods from
 
02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
excessive rainfall now that's not all to
 
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
blame on the plant but our direct
 
02:39:12.429 --> 02:39:12.439 align:start position:0%
environment could be greatly improved
 
02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
upon transition to renewable energy um
 
02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
with the looming possibility of the
 
02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
marac station being de commissioned I'm
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
sitting before you today to ask the
 
02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
um for support in creating a commission
 
02:39:27.870 --> 02:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
to study the replacement of this peer
 
02:39:30.269 --> 02:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
plant impo with a clean energy base load
 
02:39:32.429 --> 02:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
generator and storage station this
 
02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
commission would focus on the possible
 
02:39:35.950 --> 02:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
clean energy solutions that would not
 
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
only help improve New Hampshire's direct
 
02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
environmental and health impacts but
 
02:39:43.150 --> 02:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
also help reduce electric costs that are
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
directly affected by our over Reliance
 
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
on outd fossil fuel
 
02:39:48.990 --> 02:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
technology the creation of this study
 
02:39:51.389 --> 02:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
would also ensure the residents of bow
 
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
plant workers Department of Department
 
02:39:56.030 --> 02:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
of energy Department of Environmental
 
02:39:58.670 --> 02:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
Services and the state have seats at the
 
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
table for this conversation I believe we
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
also discussed the owners coming in as a
 
02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
part of this conversation as well um and
 
02:40:10.910 --> 02:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
directly affect the transition as it um
 
02:40:13.710 --> 02:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
directly applies to their communities uh
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
myself and many residents of New
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire want to see the um want the
 
02:40:20.429 --> 02:40:20.439 align:start position:0%
marac generation Generating Station to
 
02:40:22.429 --> 02:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
provide clean steady and well-paid work
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
for our local labor force while also
 
02:40:27.230 --> 02:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
protecting our water ground and air I
 
02:40:29.110 --> 02:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
want to take this moment to appreciate
 
02:40:31.630 --> 02:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
the committee's time and consideration I
 
02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
will now accept any questions if you
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
have them thank you Mr Maru any
 
02:40:37.710 --> 02:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
muns thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
you for coming in and joining us um in
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
in your mind what is the outcome what
 
02:40:49.870 --> 02:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
outcome are you looking for from this
 
02:40:53.469 --> 02:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
commission I mean are you looking for I
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
just throw out a couple possibilities
 
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
you may have others I mean are you
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
looking for a concrete recommendation on
 
02:41:05.230 --> 02:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
a project to be built are you looking
 
02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
for a report that just
 
02:41:10.590 --> 02:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
summarizes kind of discussions among the
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders what what is the outcome
 
02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
that you're looking
 
02:41:14.439 --> 02:41:16.990 align:start position:0%
that you're looking
for

02:41:16.990 --> 02:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question um
 
02:41:21.230 --> 02:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
so the outcome that I believe I'm
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
looking for is
 
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
um well first and foremost to definitely
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
have um these groups come together and
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
discuss um kind of put on the table what
 
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
they would like to see um overall what I
 
02:41:37.550 --> 02:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
would like to see come from this um
 
02:41:41.630 --> 02:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
study would be uh recommendations on
 
02:41:43.870 --> 02:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
your thoughts or you know the thoughts
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:50.429 --> 02:41:50.439 align:start position:0%
um you know what the possibilities could
 
02:41:53.230 --> 02:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
be um because there are there's solar
 
02:41:55.870 --> 02:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
there's wind and we discuss that it it's
 
02:41:58.990 --> 02:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
quite possible it could be right where
 
02:42:01.349 --> 02:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
the Jing station is or the possibility
 
02:42:04.349 --> 02:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
of Elsewhere I think it's kind of more
 
02:42:04.359 --> 02:42:07.150 align:start position:0%
of Elsewhere I think it's kind of more
seeing

02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
02:42:11.309 --> 02:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
it's laying foundation for what could be
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
I think is what we're looking to achieve
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
here it's like the first step into the
 
02:42:20.750 --> 02:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
transition I hope that helped okay thank
 
02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
you very much seeing no further
 
02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
questions I would uh like to call on the
 
02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
last person who wants to speak on this
 
02:42:32.190 --> 02:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
friedricks and I'd ask you to keep your
 
02:42:36.349 --> 02:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
comments as brief as possible as we're
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
running out of
 
02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
time I will certainly do my best thank
 
02:42:44.030 --> 02:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
you um so M friedricks again from Durham
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and uh I support this
 
02:42:51.230 --> 02:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
bill um and for me the connection um
 
02:42:52.750 --> 02:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
does come back to New Hampshire's
 
02:42:55.469 --> 02:42:55.479 align:start position:0%
warming Winters um and that specifically
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
to this bill the reason for focusing on
 
02:43:00.190 --> 02:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
clean energy in the study commission is
 
02:43:03.389 --> 02:43:03.399 align:start position:0%
tied to that um for me it is really sad
 
02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
to think that if I have kids they might
 
02:43:07.469 --> 02:43:07.479 align:start position:0%
not experience New Hampshire the way
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
that I did which is swimming with eels
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
in our Coastal rivers and going Maple
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
sugaring and ice fishing and the river
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
behind the my dad's house where I grew
 
02:43:19.230 --> 02:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
up 20 years ago was an ice fishing
 
02:43:20.990 --> 02:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
Village every single winter the last two
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
Winters it didn't even freeze over and
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
so it is very personal to me to think
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
that the reason I move back to the state
 
02:43:29.870 --> 02:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
may not be a reason that keeps me here
 
02:43:33.150 --> 02:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
because it is possibly not um what I
 
02:43:36.030 --> 02:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
thought it would be in terms of the you
 
02:43:37.710 --> 02:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
know the experience that I hope to have
 
02:43:42.429 --> 02:43:42.439 align:start position:0%
for my family in the future um and uh
 
02:43:45.309 --> 02:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
but but returning to the bill um the
 
02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
reason that I think this must be a clean
 
02:43:51.030 --> 02:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
energy examination is also because um in
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we already have RSA 378 37
 
02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
which is a statute that defines that we
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
will look at energy technology without
 
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
preference for type of technology and so
 
02:44:04.349 --> 02:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
we already do that as a state um the
 
02:44:05.870 --> 02:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
reason it is so important to be
 
02:44:08.309 --> 02:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
examining clean energy at this moment is
 
02:44:11.150 --> 02:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
because it is evolving so quickly
 
02:44:13.870 --> 02:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
technologically um it is you know that
 
02:44:16.590 --> 02:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
our regulatory envir perhaps is not cut
 
02:44:18.870 --> 02:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
up with where the technology is and
 
02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
there's also currently a lot of federal
 
02:44:22.830 --> 02:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
funding um that can help with costs
 
02:44:25.870 --> 02:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
around this and so this commission by
 
02:44:27.630 --> 02:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
focusing on clean energy would really
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
bring together the stakeholders in terms
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
of our legislators in terms of the doe
 
02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
and the dees to examine the regulatory
 
02:44:37.349 --> 02:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
environment and to assess whether you
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
know does it make sense to be asking for
 
02:44:40.830 --> 02:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
some changes in future legislation in
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
order to build um you know to make pave
 
02:44:46.670 --> 02:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
the way for in an energy environment
 
02:44:49.230 --> 02:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
that is diverse um and to examine
 
02:44:50.870 --> 02:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
sources of funding at this point you
 
02:44:53.389 --> 02:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
know if we can take advantage of federal
 
02:44:54.990 --> 02:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
funding that is already allocated out
 
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
there and New Hampshire residents can
 
02:44:58.550 --> 02:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
benefit then I think that's worth
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
examining and in fact our governor has
 
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
already decided to do that by pursuing
 
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
some of the IRA funding um and our state
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
legislature is also supporting that um I
 
02:45:12.110 --> 02:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
think that um you know I I don't have
 
02:45:13.750 --> 02:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
great feelings about whether it makes
 
02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
sense to to only look at this location
 
02:45:18.750 --> 02:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
or not um I do recognize that a grid
 
02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
location grid connectivity cannot be
 
02:45:23.110 --> 02:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
moved and marac station currently has
 
02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
the grid built around it and so I think
 
02:45:27.070 --> 02:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to really focus on is
 
02:45:30.389 --> 02:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
there something that can happen there um
 
02:45:32.309 --> 02:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
you know that could be could absolutely
 
02:45:34.429 --> 02:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
be solar they have over 300 acres it
 
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
could be um green Hydro it could be
 
02:45:38.830 --> 02:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
regular Hydro perhaps it could be small
 
02:45:41.550 --> 02:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
scale nuclear um there are plants across
 
02:45:42.990 --> 02:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
the country that have done those sorts
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
of conversions but um
 
02:45:47.510 --> 02:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
until we bring all the stakeholders
 
02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
together that's kind of hard to know um
 
02:45:52.269 --> 02:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
into representative Harrington's point I
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
think that absolutely there is a market
 
02:45:56.269 --> 02:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
mechanism for this to happen already in
 
02:45:58.190 --> 02:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire but the one
 
02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
piece that that doesn't include is
 
02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
really the residents of Bo and the
 
02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities and as a town
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
counselor I have a lot of sensitivity to
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
that because the hardest thing we do is
 
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
to pass a budget and to try and prevent
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
raising property taxes um and through my
 
02:46:16.590 --> 02:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
work with the nonprofit at 350 NH um I
 
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
joined them just this past summer and
 
02:46:21.429 --> 02:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
have done some door knocking um in Bow
 
02:46:24.230 --> 02:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
and and knocked in probably 120 doors
 
02:46:27.389 --> 02:46:27.399 align:start position:0%
and spoke with probably 50 different
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
households um and their greatest concern
 
02:46:32.309 --> 02:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
right now are property taxes and how
 
02:46:34.670 --> 02:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
high their rate is in their town if they
 
02:46:36.670 --> 02:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
lose marac station if it's
 
02:46:39.550 --> 02:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
decommissioned quickly they lose that
 
02:46:41.269 --> 02:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
tax revenue and that could have very
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
real impacts for some of those residents
 
02:46:44.429 --> 02:46:44.439 align:start position:0%
who were struggling to stay in their
 
02:46:47.070 --> 02:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
homes in a afford those taxes and so
 
02:46:49.630 --> 02:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
bringing in the residents of B and
 
02:46:52.990 --> 02:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
bringing in you know that local voice
 
02:46:54.269 --> 02:46:54.279 align:start position:0%
this is really the opportunity to
 
02:46:57.389 --> 02:46:57.399 align:start position:0%
provide them that to allow them to um
 
02:46:59.309 --> 02:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
get a sense of what is happening you
 
02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
know they're not controlling the outcome
 
02:47:03.670 --> 02:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
but they have a voice and they can be
 
02:47:06.429 --> 02:47:06.439 align:start position:0%
learning um they can be making plans for
 
02:47:08.110 --> 02:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
the town budget they can be thinking
 
02:47:10.590 --> 02:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
about their own land use processes which
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
are all crucial things for you know your
 
02:47:15.630 --> 02:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
select board to be doing
 
02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
um and I think that um you know uh it
 
02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
makes sense to bring all the
 
02:47:23.950 --> 02:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together in this commission
 
02:47:26.550 --> 02:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
um and to do so urgently because there
 
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
is additional funding that's out there
 
02:47:30.750 --> 02:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
um that funding I believe is focused on
 
02:47:32.389 --> 02:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
clean energy but I could be wrong on
 
02:47:35.230 --> 02:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
that um but it is first come first serve
 
02:47:37.110 --> 02:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
and it will disappear um if New
 
02:47:38.750 --> 02:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't pursue it and that
 
02:47:40.830 --> 02:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
could have very real impact for Bo
 
02:47:42.510 --> 02:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
residents in terms of if they lose the
 
02:47:45.630 --> 02:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
source of tax revenue um that will
 
02:47:48.750 --> 02:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
really affect them and the fastest way
 
02:47:50.510 --> 02:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
to examine different uh you know
 
02:47:53.110 --> 02:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities I don't believe it's for
 
02:47:55.710 --> 02:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
you know the private investors to be
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
doing their research and figuring out
 
02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
what they'd like to do and then approach
 
02:48:01.950 --> 02:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
doe and also you know I ISO New England
 
02:48:04.429 --> 02:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
and FK and you know then the Department
 
02:48:06.389 --> 02:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
of Environmental sciences and then DS
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
has to go and do studies and public
 
02:48:10.910 --> 02:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
input and then eventually it'll end up
 
02:48:14.190 --> 02:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
to the B you know planning committee and
 
02:48:16.110 --> 02:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
and be in front of them but if you can
 
02:48:18.750 --> 02:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
bring all the stakeholders together then
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
that may actually make this process much
 
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
more efficient and also you know provide
 
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
cost savings as a developer I me one of
 
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
the things I've learned from the
 
02:48:29.070 --> 02:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
planning board is that um you're going
 
02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
to have public input that's how our
 
02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
state works we like that local control
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
new New Hampshire residents want to have
 
02:48:37.230 --> 02:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
their voice if you wait to bring it in
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
until the very last minute it's a lot
 
02:48:41.309 --> 02:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
more expensive for the developers and if
 
02:48:43.150 --> 02:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
you can bring it in early and start
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
educating people and start understand
 
02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
understanding what people are looking
 
02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
for then you're much more likely to have
 
02:48:50.070 --> 02:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
a successful project um and so that's
 
02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
why I think this commission really makes
 
02:48:54.269 --> 02:48:54.279 align:start position:0%
sense now to take advantage for all
 
02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
those reasons to really represent um the
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
residents of B and New Hampshire
 
02:49:01.429 --> 02:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
residents as a whole um and make sure
 
02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
that this is something that um can
 
02:49:06.070 --> 02:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
really benefit uh the state that it is
 
02:49:08.030 --> 02:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
feasible um that it's commercially
 
02:49:10.110 --> 02:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
viable and that is something that is
 
02:49:12.030 --> 02:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
going to be of benefit to New Hampshire
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
as a
 
02:49:16.469 --> 02:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
state thank you m Ricks we have a couple
 
02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
of questions representative Corman has
 
02:49:20.349 --> 02:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:49:23.830 --> 02:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question the current plant
 
02:49:26.670 --> 02:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
maramax station has a capacity of
 
02:49:26.680 --> 02:49:28.269 align:start position:0%
maramax station has a capacity of
482

02:49:28.269 --> 02:49:28.279 align:start position:0%
482
 
02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
megaw um what are your thoughts on what
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
would be a reasonable capacity for a
 
02:49:36.070 --> 02:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
clean Baseel load plant at that very
 
02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
location so I think that that is a
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
technological question that I am not
 
02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
equipped to answer and I recognize that
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
I don't work in the energy industry um
 
02:49:46.110 --> 02:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
but I think that that's what this
 
02:49:48.790 --> 02:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
commission needs to study and address I
 
02:49:50.469 --> 02:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
imagine that um I don't know what the
 
02:49:52.190 --> 02:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
capacities are for small scale nuclear
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
for example or for green hydrogen but I
 
02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
think that some study has to be done on
 
02:49:59.590 --> 02:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
that and I also recognize that um you
 
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
know the the this
 
02:50:05.510 --> 02:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
plant's you know um blueprint base load
 
02:50:07.070 --> 02:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
is much larger than what it's actually
 
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
used for today so whether it makes sense
 
02:50:12.710 --> 02:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
to be pursuing you know a maximum um
 
02:50:15.070 --> 02:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
contribution at this location or rather
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
something that can at least cover what
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
is currently there I I leave that to the
 
02:50:20.950 --> 02:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
commission I think that that's where we
 
02:50:23.710 --> 02:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
need our regulatory um bodies where we
 
02:50:25.630 --> 02:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
need our industry we need our private
 
02:50:28.389 --> 02:50:28.399 align:start position:0%
you know Market as well to provide input
 
02:50:30.190 --> 02:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
um the one thing I would say is that you
 
02:50:32.349 --> 02:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
know whether or not um the current
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
plants owners are are part of this um
 
02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
commission I think that that could make
 
02:50:40.269 --> 02:50:40.279 align:start position:0%
could possibly be reasonable either way
 
02:50:44.110 --> 02:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
but I do think that um it might be I
 
02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
would I think it's important that this
 
02:50:48.990 --> 02:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
commotion focus on making sure that Bo
 
02:50:51.510 --> 02:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
residents um are aware of what's
 
02:50:53.870 --> 02:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
happening and have a chance to
 
02:50:57.590 --> 02:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
also um learn about different
 
02:50:59.030 --> 02:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
possibilities and to share their
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
concerns and their um and what they
 
02:51:03.710 --> 02:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
would like to see and I would I think
 
02:51:05.269 --> 02:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's important that the focus of this
 
02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
commission stay on that as well as for
 
02:51:09.469 --> 02:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
the state as a whole and then of course
 
02:51:12.110 --> 02:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
this is ultimately it's um you know this
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
is a market um are you ities are
 
02:51:17.590 --> 02:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
market-based this is privately owned
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
eventually you know no decision is this
 
02:51:21.349 --> 02:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
is not a mandated thing in any way it's
 
02:51:24.670 --> 02:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
a voluntary kind of information finding
 
02:51:27.950 --> 02:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
um you know process that would hope to
 
02:51:29.630 --> 02:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
bring together the stakeholders and make
 
02:51:31.309 --> 02:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
sure that New Hampshire residents have
 
02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
have a voice particularly the most local
 
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
residents Bo residents okay I think you
 
02:51:36.750 --> 02:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
answered that question thank you
 
02:51:40.229 --> 02:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative nter has one thank you
 
02:51:42.950 --> 02:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
the state of Ohio has classified natural
 
02:51:45.070 --> 02:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
gas a known hydrocarbon
 
02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
as clean energy what is your definition
 
02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
of clean
 
02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
energy so my definition of clean energy
 
02:51:56.349 --> 02:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
is something that is not going to be um
 
02:52:00.550 --> 02:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
contributing to additional um carbon
 
02:52:03.550 --> 02:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
dioxide or other greenhouse gas um
 
02:52:07.670 --> 02:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
emissions in our atmosphere um in a way
 
02:52:10.349 --> 02:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
that would cause continued um Greenhouse
 
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
effects and warming of our climate and
 
02:52:16.190 --> 02:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
so I think you know new sh state has has
 
02:52:18.269 --> 02:52:18.279 align:start position:0%
defined clean energy and and I'm going
 
02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
off of the definition that the the state
 
02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
has already established I I'm not you
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
know I don't think this one commission
 
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
should be trying to rework um all of New
 
02:52:28.750 --> 02:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's laws so I think we have a
 
02:52:32.070 --> 02:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
definition followup followup are you
 
02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
aware that in China they're building um
 
02:52:37.150 --> 02:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
a new coal plant every two weeks to
 
02:52:41.990 --> 02:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
manufacture the parts for um solar wind
 
02:52:45.790 --> 02:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
other sources of so-called green
 
02:52:49.389 --> 02:52:49.399 align:start position:0%
energy I am aware that um China is
 
02:52:51.070 --> 02:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
continuing to build coal plants they're
 
02:52:53.389 --> 02:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
also switching to Renewables at a very
 
02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
fast rate and I had a fascinating
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
conversation with Nikki Haley um about
 
02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
this and how we might um hold China
 
02:53:02.750 --> 02:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
accountable to reducing their own carbon
 
02:53:04.950 --> 02:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
emissions um and was really excited by
 
02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
that conversation remember we're not
 
02:53:09.630 --> 02:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
here to debate we're here to ask
 
02:53:12.550 --> 02:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
questions um representative Wendy Thomas
 
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair um
 
02:53:17.150 --> 02:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
you've done a terrific job of advocating
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
for the town of bow and you've made it
 
02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
very clear that the residents of bow are
 
02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh stakeholders and all of this has the
 
02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
town of bow considered or would they
 
02:53:30.269 --> 02:53:30.279 align:start position:0%
consider creating their own
 
02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
commission uh that is bow Centric uh to
 
02:53:33.600 --> 02:53:34.950 align:start position:0%
commission uh that is bow Centric uh to
address

02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
this um I think that's a great question
 
02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
I I think that um I know that the energy
 
02:53:42.070 --> 02:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
committee has had some discussion of
 
02:53:45.469 --> 02:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
this um but I you know and I won't speak
 
02:53:50.590 --> 02:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
for them um but as a a town rep who's
 
02:53:53.150 --> 02:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
you know volunteer as as as you are all
 
02:53:55.269 --> 02:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
as well this is not our you know our
 
02:53:59.349 --> 02:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
paid um full-time job um it's really
 
02:54:03.469 --> 02:54:03.479 align:start position:0%
hard to gather the sort of technical um
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory experience as a volunteer
 
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
Committee in a small town you know to
 
02:54:11.349 --> 02:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
examine the possibilities here we really
 
02:54:12.830 --> 02:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
need to hear from
 
02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
industry we need to hear from Dees we
 
02:54:17.550 --> 02:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
need to hear from Department of energy
 
02:54:19.870 --> 02:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
we need to hear from our legislators um
 
02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that can only happen at at
 
02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
the state level in terms of bringing
 
02:54:25.389 --> 02:54:25.399 align:start position:0%
these different folks
 
02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
together thank
 
02:54:31.070 --> 02:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
you okay uh representative Ms has a
 
02:54:33.630 --> 02:54:33.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:54:35.950 --> 02:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
you again for coming in you've you've
 
02:54:39.070 --> 02:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
done a a great job of uh presenting a
 
02:54:42.030 --> 02:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
very compelling argument why it's
 
02:54:43.950 --> 02:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
important to bring people together and
 
02:54:43.960 --> 02:54:44.790 align:start position:0%
important to bring people together and
have

02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:54:46.150 --> 02:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
the kind of discussion that you're
 
02:54:49.349 --> 02:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
looking for and and I want to follow up
 
02:54:51.510 --> 02:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit on what uh representative
 
02:54:54.750 --> 02:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas just asked you um the way
 
02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is structured it would create
 
02:54:57.120 --> 02:54:58.150 align:start position:0%
this bill is structured it would create
a

02:54:58.150 --> 02:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:55:03.150 --> 02:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
commission that best casee probably gets
 
02:55:04.510 --> 02:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
established in
 
02:55:08.630 --> 02:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
June and then sunsets on November
 
02:55:12.349 --> 02:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
1st is that enough time to have that
 
02:55:14.910 --> 02:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
kind of discussion or should we be
 
02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
looking at some other mechanism to have
 
02:55:20.990 --> 02:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
a really robust
 
02:55:24.670 --> 02:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
discussion um I think that the
 
02:55:27.429 --> 02:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
legislature may have a a better response
 
02:55:29.710 --> 02:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
to that than I would um I do think that
 
02:55:31.870 --> 02:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
six months would allow at least for the
 
02:55:34.110 --> 02:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to come together it would
 
02:55:36.070 --> 02:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
allow for representative to be chosen
 
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
from the town of B which would be really
 
02:55:39.990 --> 02:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
important to have the town be working on
 
02:55:42.550 --> 02:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
that and identifying um and they would
 
02:55:45.790 --> 02:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
have to um you know find a process to
 
02:55:49.030 --> 02:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
represent their their residents um as
 
02:55:51.229 --> 02:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
well in that and it would be an
 
02:55:54.150 --> 02:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to certainly bring together
 
02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of the existing research um about
 
02:55:57.870 --> 02:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
which opportunities are out there it may
 
02:56:00.349 --> 02:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
not have complete findings in terms of
 
02:56:02.070 --> 02:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know whether a certain option is
 
02:56:04.469 --> 02:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
feasible at that time but I think you
 
02:56:06.510 --> 02:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
know six months the department of energy
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
is putting together a climate action
 
02:56:10.309 --> 02:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
plan for the State of New Hampshire now
 
02:56:12.910 --> 02:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
in less than six months so I think that
 
02:56:15.349 --> 02:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
um you know important groundwork can be
 
02:56:18.429 --> 02:56:18.439 align:start position:0%
done in that time especially in terms of
 
02:56:20.150 --> 02:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
getting all the stakeholders into the
 
02:56:22.990 --> 02:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
same space seeing where they're at and
 
02:56:25.309 --> 02:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
understanding um what funding mechanisms
 
02:56:27.750 --> 02:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
are POS possibly available right now
 
02:56:29.229 --> 02:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be available in the future
 
02:56:30.710 --> 02:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
and I think those are the most time
 
02:56:33.510 --> 02:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
critical um components and also to
 
02:56:35.389 --> 02:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
understanding for the town of bow what
 
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
sort of timeline may be there for marac
 
02:56:39.510 --> 02:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
station how do they need to plan for
 
02:56:42.910 --> 02:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
their own town budget and their property
 
02:56:45.510 --> 02:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
taxes okay okay thank you very much
 
02:56:47.309 --> 02:56:47.319 align:start position:0%

02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%

04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
difference to make a difference which is
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
something that I think we can all agree
 
04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh we need more of right now the New
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire clean energy Community
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
resilience and conservation Corp would
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
be designed to build upon the existing
 
04:12:29.309 --> 04:12:29.319 align:start position:0%
network of americore through volunteer
 
04:12:31.389 --> 04:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh which is our state's
 
04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
commission for National and Community
 
04:12:35.550 --> 04:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
Service uh and local nonprofit programs
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%

04:12:39.790 --> 04:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh whose national headquarters is
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually here in New Hampshire it's in
 
04:12:44.990 --> 04:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
Charlestown uh and it has a flagship
 
04:12:46.910 --> 04:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
program that operates out of Bear Brook
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
State Park programs that are already
 
04:12:51.389 --> 04:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
accomplishing really important work like
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
wildfire remediation resiliency Disaster
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
Response and Workforce Development but
 
04:12:59.469 --> 04:12:59.479 align:start position:0%

04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
address specific needs in communities
 
04:13:03.149 --> 04:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
across our state so what does it look
 
04:13:06.750 --> 04:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
like in action um well that's up to you
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
and to uh members of the study committee
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh if we create it but other pilot
 
04:13:14.030 --> 04:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
programs across the country are doing
 
04:13:15.990 --> 04:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
really important work to reduce carbon
 
04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
emissions save energy costs by
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%

can also be found uh supporting urban
 
04:13:30.910 --> 04:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
areas by creating and maintaining uh
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
city parks and green spaces improving

disasters so you know we want to be well
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
positioned to make our case to the
 
04:14:11.550 --> 04:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
federal government uh to americore that
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is ready to stand up a
 
04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
clean energy uh Community resilience and
 
04:14:17.429 --> 04:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
Conservation Corps here in the granite
 
04:14:19.790 --> 04:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
state and that's uh what my bill would
 
04:14:22.229 --> 04:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
do it would convene stakeholders you
 
04:14:24.189 --> 04:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
know executive departments national
 
04:14:25.950 --> 04:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
service field local community leaders
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations of Interest high
 
04:14:31.389 --> 04:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
schools uh institutions of higher ed
 
04:14:34.349 --> 04:14:34.359 align:start position:0%
employers to shape launch and sustain a
 
04:14:36.189 --> 04:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
program that meets the needs the unique
 
04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
needs of the Granite State State um you
 
04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
know over the summer and fall I would
 
04:14:42.469 --> 04:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
Envision that this uh committee would
 
04:14:44.590 --> 04:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
identify public private and nonprofit
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
funding sources uh Community needs
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
potential Partnerships uh there's work
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done to identify
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
projects and partner with americor and
 
04:14:54.750 --> 04:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer New Hampshire uh which would
 
04:14:56.750 --> 04:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
be responsible for Grant making and
 
04:14:59.149 --> 04:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
oversight um there was a study conducted
 
04:15:01.950 --> 04:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
a few years back uh by ICF and
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
commissioned by uh the Charles Stewart
 
04:15:06.269 --> 04:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
mop Foundation uh found that national
 
04:15:08.189 --> 04:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
service programs leverage the skills and
 
04:15:10.429 --> 04:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
talents of citizens to address unmet
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
Community needs uh offer substantial
 
04:15:15.070 --> 04:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
monetary benefits for all stakeholder
 
04:15:17.590 --> 04:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
groups and a significant return on
 
04:15:19.630 --> 04:15:19.640 align:start position:0%
investment economists report that for
 
04:15:21.469 --> 04:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
every dollar that Congress appropriates
 
04:15:24.389 --> 04:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
to Americar returns more than $17 to
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
society program members and the
 
04:15:30.269 --> 04:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
government um you know I hope that there
 
04:15:32.790 --> 04:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
will be Partnerships with employers uh
 
04:15:34.469 --> 04:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
to ensure that Workforce funding and
 
04:15:36.389 --> 04:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
curriculum is in place including
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeship
 
04:15:40.030 --> 04:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
programs uh they'll ensure that these
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
americore members not only have an
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
impact during their term of service but
 
04:15:45.830 --> 04:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
are also set up for 21st century clean
 
04:15:47.469 --> 04:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
energy jobs that will come online in the
 
04:15:50.910 --> 04:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
coming years as our uh energy economy
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
shifts away from fossil fuels and into
 
04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
Renewables and that's why uh you know
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
companies like revision energy and uh
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know which Dan weeks uh is an americ
 
04:16:03.990 --> 04:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
or Alum himself I know he often
 
04:16:06.269 --> 04:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
testifies in front of this committee um
 
04:16:08.109 --> 04:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
but Dan knows that his company stands to
 
04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
benefit uh from a program like this and
 
04:16:12.910 --> 04:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
the quality Workforce that it will
 
04:16:15.149 --> 04:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
produce uh young people want to do this
 
04:16:17.429 --> 04:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
work uh half of all voters under the age
 
04:16:18.990 --> 04:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
of 45 say that they would consider
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
joining a program like this if a
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
position was available to them uh our
 
04:16:25.149 --> 04:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
environment needs it our state's economy
 
04:16:26.389 --> 04:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
is going to need workers with this kind
 
04:16:27.630 --> 04:16:27.640 align:start position:0%
of background and training so it's
 
04:16:30.189 --> 04:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
really a win-win
 
04:16:34.510 --> 04:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
um there was a a study commission uh a
 
04:16:38.070 --> 04:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
few years ago uh that studied Pathways
 
04:16:40.030 --> 04:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
from civilian national service programs
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
like americore and the peace score uh to
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
an affordable degree or credential and a
 
04:16:45.790 --> 04:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
meaningful career here in the state of
 
04:16:47.710 --> 04:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um there's some good
 
04:16:50.590 --> 04:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations in there uh that I think
 
04:16:53.070 --> 04:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
can help the work of a study committee
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh to really Define a program that that
 
04:16:57.030 --> 04:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
will be successful uh deliver results
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the communities it serves and then
 
04:17:03.070 --> 04:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
also prepare uh the 21st century uh
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
Workforce with uh the workers that it
 
04:17:08.149 --> 04:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
needs so uh with that happy to answer
 
04:17:10.229 --> 04:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you
 
04:17:12.830 --> 04:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
04:17:15.149 --> 04:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
Wilhelm so I have a couple of questions
 
04:17:18.670 --> 04:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
to start out you mentioned in your
 
04:17:22.109 --> 04:17:22.119 align:start position:0%
testimony americore and something called
 
04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:17:26.349 --> 04:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
volunteers volunteer New Hampshire is
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
that what it was that's right
 
04:17:28.359 --> 04:17:30.590 align:start position:0%
that what it was that's right
sorry

04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:17:34.590 --> 04:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh the bill doesn't mention
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
those organizations any anywhere uh so
 
04:17:41.389 --> 04:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused about what the
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
purpose of the study committee would be
 
04:17:49.229 --> 04:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
would it be to work with the maricor to
 
04:17:50.910 --> 04:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
establish something here in New
 
04:17:50.920 --> 04:17:53.469 align:start position:0%
establish something here in New
Hampshire

04:17:53.469 --> 04:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
or on line 11 it says shape a new
 
04:18:00.030 --> 04:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
civilian national service
 
04:18:03.229 --> 04:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
program what does shape mean in this
 
04:18:05.910 --> 04:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
context I'm I'm confused about exactly
 
04:18:07.229 --> 04:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to accomplish
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
sure yeah so uh before New National
 
04:18:13.149 --> 04:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
service programs launch and there's an
 
04:18:15.109 --> 04:18:15.119 align:start position:0%
umbrella called americore and underneath
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
it are different types of programs some
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
are education Focus like the one that I
 
04:18:23.229 --> 04:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
served in called City ear um the student
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
conservation Corp is another example uh
 
04:18:28.630 --> 04:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
there are these clean energy and
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
conservation and Community resilience
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
cores that are cropping up across the
 
04:18:33.550 --> 04:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
country because young people have said
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
that they want to do this type of
 
04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
service in their communities because
 
04:18:38.990 --> 04:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
because they're interested in jobs uh
 
04:18:42.030 --> 04:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
that could result uh from being a part
 
04:18:44.349 --> 04:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
of sort of this transition from fossil
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
fuels to the clean energy economy um
 
04:18:50.830 --> 04:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
this study committee would convene
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders which would include
 
04:18:54.990 --> 04:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
americore could include volunteer New
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but also include highered
 
04:19:00.309 --> 04:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
institutions could include local uh
 
04:19:03.469 --> 04:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations could include uh
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
Community leaders and uh nonprofits that
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
are doing good work in their communities
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
that said hey this is a way for us to
 
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
scale our work to do more of it uh and
 
04:19:15.550 --> 04:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
engage young people in the process so
 
04:19:17.950 --> 04:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
you know in order to apply for federal
 
04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
funding that would be available uh they
 
04:19:21.870 --> 04:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
need to go through their state service
 
04:19:23.229 --> 04:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
commission for New Hampshire that's
 
04:19:26.550 --> 04:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
called volunteer New Hampshire um and
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
that's how you get access to americore
 
04:19:30.189 --> 04:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
funding and there are millions of
 
04:19:32.830 --> 04:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
dollars uh that are available uh through
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
that program that has had bipartisan
 
04:19:40.269 --> 04:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you additional questions
 
04:19:42.960 --> 04:19:44.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you additional questions
representative

04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you thank you for
 
04:19:48.429 --> 04:19:48.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I know you
 
04:19:50.070 --> 04:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned Federal fundings and I see
 
04:19:53.670 --> 04:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
there's no FN on this bill so is the I
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
goal going forward that there would be
 
04:19:58.349 --> 04:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
State funds as well as Federal taxpayer
 
04:20:01.109 --> 04:20:01.119 align:start position:0%
dollars used to fund this new call or
 
04:20:03.109 --> 04:20:03.119 align:start position:0%
whatever it is yeah it's a great
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
question representative so uh I think
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
looking at uh private funding looking at
 
04:20:12.109 --> 04:20:12.119 align:start position:0%
philanthropic funding how that I mean
 
04:20:14.070 --> 04:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
that that is how most of these americore
 
04:20:16.469 --> 04:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
programs are funded um there are some
 
04:20:18.269 --> 04:20:18.279 align:start position:0%
states or municipalities that also
 
04:20:20.189 --> 04:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
provide funding from time to time that
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
has not been a tradition here in the
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh so many of
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
these programs uh get up up and running
 
04:20:28.269 --> 04:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
they they get a chunk of funding from
 
04:20:30.269 --> 04:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
the federal government uh but then they
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
get additional funding that's uh
 
04:20:34.670 --> 04:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
fundraised through foundations through
 
04:20:36.590 --> 04:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
you know philanthropy New Hampshire
 
04:20:39.030 --> 04:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
chable foundation for example follow up
 
04:20:40.990 --> 04:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
quick follow up so when you say Federal
 
04:20:43.950 --> 04:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
money you mean taxpayer dollars I mean
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
Federal funding which is taxpayer
 
04:20:48.510 --> 04:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
dollars absolutely thank you
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
yep representative muns has a question
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:20:56.109 --> 04:20:56.119 align:start position:0%
representative for being here um my my
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill is that it doesn't
 
04:20:59.399 --> 04:21:00.750 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill is that it doesn't
actually

04:21:00.750 --> 04:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
establish this um core that you're
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
talking about what it's trying what it
 
04:21:11.790 --> 04:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
does do though is hopefully um create a
 
04:21:14.590 --> 04:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
blueprint that is going to be available
 
04:21:16.750 --> 04:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
that'll be there so that if federal
 
04:21:18.750 --> 04:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
funds do become available or other
 
04:21:21.630 --> 04:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
funding sources do become available that
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
we can then take advantage of that and
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
that at that point we would actually
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
establish this core can you just clarify
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
that for me you bet and I think there
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
there are a number of different ways
 
04:21:34.189 --> 04:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
that you know new cores can become
 
04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
established uh some have been completely
 
04:21:40.469 --> 04:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
privately funded in the past you know to
 
04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
say hey we're going to start a pilot
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
program to show that this works uh so
 
04:21:47.309 --> 04:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
that when we apply for additional
 
04:21:49.070 --> 04:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
funding you know we've got a track
 
04:21:52.189 --> 04:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
record of impact uh that we can point to
 
04:21:55.030 --> 04:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh others you know take the time to to
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
put together a plan before applying
 
04:22:00.109 --> 04:22:00.119 align:start position:0%
directly for federal funding or for um
 
04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know money that's allocated to
 
04:22:03.109 --> 04:22:03.119 align:start position:0%
volunteer New Hampshire and then they
 
04:22:05.309 --> 04:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
decide where that funding goes so this
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
is really a process
 
04:22:09.429 --> 04:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh to pull stakeholders together to to
 
04:22:11.870 --> 04:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
decide what a program could look like in
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire identify
 
04:22:15.630 --> 04:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
Partners uh perhaps there's a college or
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
university that wants to offer academic
 
04:22:20.510 --> 04:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
credit uh that wants to offer additional
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship dollars because they're
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
looking for uh these types of of young
 
04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
people who are you know community-minded
 
04:22:30.189 --> 04:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
and service driven uh who want a career
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
in a in this particular area um I think
 
04:22:36.389 --> 04:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
we need to jump that process and in
 
04:22:38.309 --> 04:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
order to figure out what the the the
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
power and possibility and potential is
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
04:22:46.030 --> 04:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
followup followup um so you know we've
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
put we put this plan together we've
 
04:22:51.630 --> 04:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
identified um you know funding Avenues
 
04:22:55.790 --> 04:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
Etc um would would we need State
 
04:22:58.590 --> 04:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
legislation to actually establish this
 
04:23:01.510 --> 04:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
core or could that happen without
 
04:23:03.030 --> 04:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislative action thanks for the
 
04:23:04.990 --> 04:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up question uh it could happen
 
04:23:06.870 --> 04:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
without legislative action it could be
 
04:23:08.590 --> 04:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
that there is a leading nonprofit
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
organization or uh a college or
 
04:23:12.750 --> 04:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
university that steps forward to say I
 
04:23:15.389 --> 04:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
want to be the fiscal sponsor of this
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
program uh because we've got we we see
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
it as an opportunity for us to meet our
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
Strategic Mission uh and they could take
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
it and run with it and they they may
 
04:23:26.990 --> 04:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
have ideas about the ways that they
 
04:23:29.830 --> 04:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
could fund it um you know again to not
 
04:23:32.710 --> 04:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
require any state funding uh because
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
again there you know State there there
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
are many maror programs that are running
 
04:23:39.070 --> 04:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
and they don't have americore they sorry
 
04:23:43.950 --> 04:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
they don't have state funding uh they
 
04:23:46.030 --> 04:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
only have Federal funding which again is
 
04:23:49.710 --> 04:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
matched um that is leveraged uh to have
 
04:23:53.590 --> 04:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.349 --> 04:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
impact representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:23:59.429 --> 04:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
04:24:02.710 --> 04:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative for being here um there
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
the deliverable is a report that goes to
 
04:24:05.790 --> 04:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate and the
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
president and all that kind of um could
 
04:24:10.790 --> 04:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
another deliverable be um a federal
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
application for funding or is that part
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
two does that come afterwards that's
 
04:24:19.389 --> 04:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
part two but I think the the the
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
application for federal funding would be
 
04:24:24.990 --> 04:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
strengthened by a plan like this thank
 
04:24:28.229 --> 04:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee has a question
 
04:24:29.870 --> 04:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:24:32.670 --> 04:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
around the um the description of the
 
04:24:37.389 --> 04:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
deliverables that you're going to try
 
04:24:39.870 --> 04:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
and get to in the time frame that you
 
04:24:42.189 --> 04:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
have because we November 1st is the
 
04:24:43.469 --> 04:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
cutoff right the report's going to be
 
04:24:47.229 --> 04:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
delivered in a relatively timely manner
 
04:24:49.109 --> 04:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering whether you
 
04:24:51.109 --> 04:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
think the timeline is sufficient in
 
04:24:54.109 --> 04:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
order to achieve um the goals of
 
04:24:56.429 --> 04:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
identifying the stakeholders and then
 
04:24:58.670 --> 04:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
getting those stakeholders to identify
 
04:25:00.670 --> 04:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
the details of the program which seems
 
04:25:02.349 --> 04:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
quite folsome I mean it can cover a lot
 
04:25:04.550 --> 04:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
of things in a state that's diverse
 
04:25:05.950 --> 04:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
right it could yeah could be all kinds
 
04:25:08.030 --> 04:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
of stuff for sure thanks for the
 
04:25:10.750 --> 04:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
question um I do think that there is
 
04:25:13.469 --> 04:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
ample time to pull together even just
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
sort of the be bones plan uh and then
 
04:25:17.790 --> 04:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
from there I think there will be a
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
number of recommendations that would
 
04:25:22.109 --> 04:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
come out of the study that could include
 
04:25:24.510 --> 04:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
further work to identify funding sources
 
04:25:27.149 --> 04:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
further work to identify uh local
 
04:25:28.389 --> 04:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
projects to make sure that we're having
 
04:25:30.550 --> 04:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
a reach in urban areas and Suburban
 
04:25:33.870 --> 04:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
areas and rural areas across the state
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
um you know could be could be a decision
 
04:25:39.109 --> 04:25:39.119 align:start position:0%
decision made at the study uh through
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
the study to uh just focus on
 
04:25:45.109 --> 04:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
conservation just focus on clean energy
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
just focus on community resilience or
 
04:25:49.389 --> 04:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
two out of the three um lots of
 
04:25:52.189 --> 04:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
different ways this could go um but I do
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
think that it's an ambitious plan but
 
04:25:56.870 --> 04:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
also achievable uh in the in the amount
 
04:25:58.389 --> 04:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
of time that's
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
allotted followup okay so along those
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
lines um what I was thinking was um do
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
you anticipate that when you try to pull
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
together the stakeholders for this
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
initial slice at the Apple um that you
 
04:26:14.670 --> 04:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
would be trying to identify stakeholders
 
04:26:16.990 --> 04:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
who might be able to stay engaged I'm
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
trying I'm trying to figure out what the
 
04:26:21.269 --> 04:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
through line is right so stakeholders
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
that might be willing to stay engaged in
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
terms of managing the project because
 
04:26:28.309 --> 04:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
you need some kind of a governance
 
04:26:31.109 --> 04:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
structure and if the report doesn't come
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
back to us asking us to do something
 
04:26:34.590 --> 04:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
further what what happens you know does
 
04:26:36.109 --> 04:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
it just get dropped so I'm just
 
04:26:38.830 --> 04:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
wondering who would who do you um
 
04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
perceive as being participants in this
 
04:26:44.710 --> 04:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh study if it goes forward you bet uh
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for the followup so I think that
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
the the stakeholder groups you know
 
04:26:51.830 --> 04:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
include nonprofit organizations that are
 
04:26:54.429 --> 04:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
already doing this kind of work already
 
04:26:56.790 --> 04:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh it could include colleges and
 
04:26:59.109 --> 04:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
universities high schools uh could
 
04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
include employers uh potential
 
04:27:04.429 --> 04:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
employers um I think there are a lot of
 
04:27:05.710 --> 04:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders that could come
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
to the table I think the hope is that uh
 
04:27:11.670 --> 04:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
one or more of them emerge that would be
 
04:27:14.469 --> 04:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
willing to serve as uh the fiscal
 
04:27:16.710 --> 04:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the project to really take
 
04:27:19.030 --> 04:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
ownership of it and say we're gonna
 
04:27:20.910 --> 04:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to run it whether it's a you
 
04:27:24.149 --> 04:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
know a a 12ers program or it's you know
 
04:27:27.790 --> 04:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
a 36 or maybe a 60 person program um
 
04:27:29.229 --> 04:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
lots of different ways that this plays
 
04:27:30.790 --> 04:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
out in other states and other
 
04:27:32.950 --> 04:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
communities um but I do think that that
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
is one of the goals is to you know
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
figure out who's who's really interested
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
in driving this uh and seeing what their
 
04:27:42.189 --> 04:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
willingness is to take it on thank
 
04:27:45.429 --> 04:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
you representative bernardy has a
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh so when I
 
04:27:52.189 --> 04:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
heard you go through the list of
 
04:27:57.229 --> 04:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
potential taskings that these um various
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh service organizations could do um
 
04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
some of them included what I consider
 
04:28:08.630 --> 04:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
operational private businesses or there
 
04:28:11.349 --> 04:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
are people out there doing that kind of
 
04:28:13.830 --> 04:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
thing so how are we going to make sure
 
04:28:17.670 --> 04:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a federally funded
 
04:28:20.670 --> 04:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
organization coming in and taking away
 
04:28:23.149 --> 04:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
Private Business Opportunities yeah
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative thanks for the question
 
04:28:27.710 --> 04:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
um one of the really smart things that I
 
04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
think was in the americore legislation
 
04:28:31.229 --> 04:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
that F that passed by the federal
 
04:28:33.790 --> 04:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
government 30 years ago uh was to making
 
04:28:36.630 --> 04:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
sure that no private employees or even
 
04:28:38.790 --> 04:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
public sector employees are being
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
displaced uh by new national service
 
04:28:43.109 --> 04:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
opportunities so that is something that
 
04:28:45.309 --> 04:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
is in federal statute uh and it is
 
04:28:46.590 --> 04:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
against the law and there are regular
 
04:28:49.950 --> 04:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
audits to ensure that that doesn't take
 
04:28:53.469 --> 04:28:53.479 align:start position:0%
place representative n has a question
 
04:28:55.389 --> 04:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a three-part question
 
04:28:56.750 --> 04:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
can you
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
define um coastal wetlands describe how
 
04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
you protect them or rebuild them rather
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
and then explain how rebuilding them
 
04:29:07.149 --> 04:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
protect the coastal communities from
 
04:29:09.990 --> 04:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
Storm surges and flooding great question
 
04:29:13.349 --> 04:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh and so these are some of the uh
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
duties and responsibilities that have
 
04:29:16.990 --> 04:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
been put out by the federal government
 
04:29:18.790 --> 04:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
saying hey if you're going to develop a
 
04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
future program like this this may be one
 
04:29:24.790 --> 04:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
of the things that you consider uh so
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to sit here and Define
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
that I think what's important is that if
 
04:29:29.550 --> 04:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
the study committee is established that
 
04:29:30.990 --> 04:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
they consider whether or not that is
 
04:29:32.510 --> 04:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
something that would fit the description
 
04:29:34.510 --> 04:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire uh
 
04:29:35.710 --> 04:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
whether that's something that core
 
04:29:38.590 --> 04:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
members could or should be working on um
 
04:29:40.990 --> 04:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
because it's not something you know each
 
04:29:42.510 --> 04:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
each of these programs it isn't like
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's just sort of a cookie cutter
 
04:29:45.670 --> 04:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
that says hey this is it it's going to
 
04:29:47.429 --> 04:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
look the same in all 50 states across
 
04:29:49.870 --> 04:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
the country or in every Community uh
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
across the US it's really important that
 
04:29:55.070 --> 04:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh there's a group that is invested in
 
04:29:57.630 --> 04:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
the concept that really discerns whether
 
04:29:59.550 --> 04:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
or not that is something that is
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that Community uh and so
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
that's what the study committee would
 
04:30:04.640 --> 04:30:07.229 align:start position:0%
that's what the study committee would
do

04:30:07.229 --> 04:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:30:09.149 --> 04:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
representative Tony Kaplan has a
 
04:30:11.229 --> 04:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:30:13.030 --> 04:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
you representative for coming in and
 
04:30:15.469 --> 04:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill um this is a
 
04:30:17.189 --> 04:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
national service program that's that's
 
04:30:19.469 --> 04:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
being uh promulgated by the federal
 
04:30:21.510 --> 04:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
government is it up and running and I I
 
04:30:22.670 --> 04:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
might have Miss This in in your
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
testimony but is it up and running in
 
04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
other states and what does that look
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
like is it is it being funded by as you
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know private businesses or
 
04:30:33.429 --> 04:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
colleges or employ who's who's behind
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
the the the funding for it yeah thanks
 
04:30:37.389 --> 04:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
for the question I think there it looks
 
04:30:39.030 --> 04:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
different in different states I know
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
that there are five states that have a
 
04:30:43.389 --> 04:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
program like this operating now another
 
04:30:45.950 --> 04:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
five that are shovel ready uh and that
 
04:30:48.389 --> 04:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
are getting private philanthropy uh to
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
help them pilot their programs um Maine
 
04:30:54.109 --> 04:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
established one I think it was it's
 
04:30:56.830 --> 04:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
either two or four years ago now uh and
 
04:30:59.109 --> 04:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
they are just now uh getting core
 
04:31:00.510 --> 04:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
members up and running so they are
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
really kind of a pioneer of this um and
 
04:31:04.510 --> 04:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
I think it' be interesting to look you
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
know especially when we think about you
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
know Wetlands does it make sense to uh
 
04:31:11.830 --> 04:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
take a look in what what Maine is doing
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know maybe it makes sense to bring
 
04:31:14.870 --> 04:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues from Maine knowing that there
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
are similar um you know environmental uh
 
04:31:20.070 --> 04:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know there's some similarities
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
between our two states given our
 
04:31:24.189 --> 04:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
proximity uh does it make sense to bring
 
04:31:25.670 --> 04:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
them in to talk about what they're doing
 
04:31:27.309 --> 04:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
what their approach is to make sure that
 
04:31:31.349 --> 04:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
wheel representative licki has a
 
04:31:35.309 --> 04:31:35.319 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:31:37.870 --> 04:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
you for for taking my question um you
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned that volunteer New Hampshire
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
could conceivably be part of this and as
 
04:31:44.429 --> 04:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
I see it if we do something through the
 
04:31:46.189 --> 04:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
legislature we might do nothing but slow
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
it down because before anything could
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
happen we have to have the commission
 
04:31:51.790 --> 04:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
give a report um we have to have bills
 
04:31:55.630 --> 04:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
filed and so that puts us into the uh
 
04:31:58.309 --> 04:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
middle of 2025 at the earliest whereas I
 
04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
would think that a private organization
 
04:32:02.550 --> 04:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
could be more Nal would you disagree or
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
agree uh it's a it's a really good
 
04:32:07.790 --> 04:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
question I think given uh the funding
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
Cycles uh for americore which run
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
through volunteer New Hampshire uh
 
04:32:15.229 --> 04:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
having a report that was finalized by I
 
04:32:16.670 --> 04:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
think it's November 1st in the
 
04:32:18.910 --> 04:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
legislation uh would be good timing in
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
terms of preparing uh an organization or
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
group of organizations to apply for that
 
04:32:25.109 --> 04:32:25.119 align:start position:0%
Federal funding so I don't think it
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
would slow anything down I think it
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
might actually creates emergency uh to
 
04:32:31.710 --> 04:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
get people to move forward thank you
 
04:32:31.720 --> 04:32:32.910 align:start position:0%
get people to move forward thank you
thank

04:32:32.910 --> 04:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:32:35.229 --> 04:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington has a
 
04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
question question thank you um just I'm
 
04:32:40.109 --> 04:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
looking at your bill here on the um
 
04:32:43.030 --> 04:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
section on the duties and it talks about
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh deploying lowcost reliable clean
 
04:32:47.309 --> 04:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
energy could you be a little more
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
specific as to what type of lowcost
 
04:32:50.790 --> 04:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
reliable clean energy you're referring
 
04:32:53.149 --> 04:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
to yeah thanks for the question I was
 
04:32:54.389 --> 04:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
actually thinking about this earlier
 
04:32:58.389 --> 04:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
today so there was an article
 
04:33:01.750 --> 04:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
um trying to think who this
 
04:33:04.830 --> 04:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
was so I'll I'll I'll share this around
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
but there was a
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
an article that ran back in July I think
 
04:33:13.830 --> 04:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
this is well regardless
 
04:33:17.750 --> 04:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
um it was talking about school districts
 
04:33:19.709 --> 04:33:19.719 align:start position:0%
who want to take advantage of funding
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
that is available uh to put up solar
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
arrays uh but there are a lot of school
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
districts that are smaller that are
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
struggling to uh find the technical
 
04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
assistance that they need uh in order to
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh work through the paperwork and get
 
04:33:37.949 --> 04:33:37.959 align:start position:0%
get access to the funding I think solar
 
04:33:41.949 --> 04:33:41.959 align:start position:0%
is one example of of uh clean energy
 
04:33:44.590 --> 04:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
that could be uh leverag through through
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
this program and I think you could have
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh these americore members actually
 
04:33:51.390 --> 04:33:51.400 align:start position:0%
providing technical assistance with
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
local school districts uh that would
 
04:33:57.990 --> 04:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
then uh make Federal Federal money
 
04:34:00.990 --> 04:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
available make State funding available
 
04:34:03.629 --> 04:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
uh and then decrease uh cost to
 
04:34:07.150 --> 04:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers follow up followup well so it
 
04:34:08.470 --> 04:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
sounds like what you're talking about is
 
04:34:11.429 --> 04:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
not low cost reliable clean energy but
 
04:34:13.709 --> 04:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers subsidized reliable clean
 
04:34:15.551 --> 04:34:15.561 align:start position:0%
energy because whether it's coming from
 
04:34:16.990 --> 04:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
the state or from the federal government
 
04:34:19.029 --> 04:34:19.039 align:start position:0%
it's all coming from taxpayers so low
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
cost is kind of deceiving here because
 
04:34:22.150 --> 04:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
the cost could be pretty high it's just
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
getting somebody else to pay for it is
 
04:34:27.629 --> 04:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
that correct I would I would uh just say
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
that this this bill is in your
 
04:34:30.750 --> 04:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
possession if you feel like you want to
 
04:34:33.629 --> 04:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
amend it you absolutely can do
 
04:34:36.949 --> 04:34:36.959 align:start position:0%
that representative Ms has a question
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair one more question for
 
04:34:42.670 --> 04:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
you are there any examples of similar
 
04:34:45.551 --> 04:34:45.561 align:start position:0%
processes that have been followed in New
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we've tried to do what
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
you're proposing here pulling it
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
together a stakeholder group creating a
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
blueprint Etc I don't know that it's
 
04:34:58.629 --> 04:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
been done through state government okay
 
04:35:00.189 --> 04:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's I think it's come
 
04:35:02.109 --> 04:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
together in different ways and I think
 
04:35:04.109 --> 04:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
this is this is one way that some states
 
04:35:06.510 --> 04:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
go about it um but there are a number of
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
different processes that that could be
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
used representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:35:14.109 --> 04:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um you
 
04:35:16.269 --> 04:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
stated that five states already have
 
04:35:18.029 --> 04:35:18.039 align:start position:0%
this program running five are shovel
 
04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
ready is there a template or a howto
 
04:35:23.310 --> 04:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
guide either from the federal government
 
04:35:25.629 --> 04:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
or from the state governments that that
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
could be used as a platform for this
 
04:35:29.789 --> 04:35:29.799 align:start position:0%
program yeah thanks for the question
 
04:35:32.709 --> 04:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
there are there's a a coalition called
 
04:35:35.670 --> 04:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh America's service commissions that uh
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
supports volunteer New Hampshire and the
 
04:35:41.789 --> 04:35:41.799 align:start position:0%
other uh I think it's 51 uh States and
 
04:35:45.551 --> 04:35:45.561 align:start position:0%
territories that have these uh these
 
04:35:47.709 --> 04:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
these service commissions that support
 
04:35:49.230 --> 04:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
National and community service across
 
04:35:52.070 --> 04:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
the country uh they have put together a
 
04:35:55.230 --> 04:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
a guide book for uh things to consider
 
04:35:57.070 --> 04:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh for new programs like this that are
 
04:35:58.750 --> 04:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
being set up and would absolutely be a
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
part of that process and I think we'd be
 
04:36:02.429 --> 04:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
you know happy to come and testify as
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
well thank
 
04:36:07.629 --> 04:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
you representative bernardy has a
 
04:36:11.590 --> 04:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh so there
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
are other organizations that do not have
 
04:36:18.070 --> 04:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
this the broad mandate that you're
 
04:36:20.910 --> 04:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
looking for here but have selected
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
pieces of it so like the agriculture
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
extension service at UNH or uh even 4H
 
04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
or FFA I mean those are great
 
04:36:31.439 --> 04:36:33.189 align:start position:0%
or FFA I mean those are great
conservation

04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
04:36:36.990 --> 04:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
organizations how does this
 
04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
approach uh help them or does it detract
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
from them or what what is the interface
 
04:36:45.629 --> 04:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
in that kind of relationship yeah thanks
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
for the question I I actually think that
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
they uh benefit from additional capacity
 
04:36:52.830 --> 04:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
that these americore members can provide
 
04:36:55.390 --> 04:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
and so if there is a larger organization
 
04:36:57.109 --> 04:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
that is the fiscal sponsor of the
 
04:37:00.750 --> 04:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
program for the State uh oftentimes they
 
04:37:04.109 --> 04:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
have a a a way that that they can deploy
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
members even full-time yearround for 12
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
months uh to a local nonprofit that may
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
not have the administrative capacity to
 
04:37:15.230 --> 04:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
apply for that funding themselves
 
04:37:17.349 --> 04:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
because they only you know could they
 
04:37:18.750 --> 04:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
only have room in their office for one
 
04:37:20.429 --> 04:37:20.439 align:start position:0%
more person but that one person could
 
04:37:22.390 --> 04:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
make a huge different difference for the
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
mission of their organization so that is
 
04:37:26.590 --> 04:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
a way that national service programs are
 
04:37:29.470 --> 04:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
set up um and a a function that that
 
04:37:31.230 --> 04:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
kind of larger fiscal sponsor can play
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
in supporting the the local network of
 
04:37:37.230 --> 04:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
04:37:40.590 --> 04:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:37:43.629 --> 04:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and um uh thank
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Bernardi I'll have a
 
04:37:46.910 --> 04:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up question to what you just
 
04:37:48.910 --> 04:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
asked I'd like to extend that question
 
04:37:51.789 --> 04:37:51.799 align:start position:0%
to what I see here in your duties in uh
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the section one um so as I read some
 
04:37:59.230 --> 04:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
of the duties here we have many state
 
04:38:01.590 --> 04:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
agencies that seem like would come under
 
04:38:03.949 --> 04:38:03.959 align:start position:0%
their purview with Department of energy
 
04:38:05.429 --> 04:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
04:38:11.269 --> 04:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
um uh agriculture um so on and so forth
 
04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
um how does this core mesh with these
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
organizations that I'm sure are looking
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
at the same things uh you're talking
 
04:38:22.830 --> 04:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
about a private organization a state
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
agency possible um uh uh diverging uh if
 
04:38:29.830 --> 04:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
they're not coordinating carefully how
 
04:38:33.310 --> 04:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
does this core help these state agencies
 
04:38:36.310 --> 04:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
do their job without inter in with them
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's a great question actually think
 
04:38:39.670 --> 04:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
you can look at the student Conservation
 
04:38:41.230 --> 04:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
Association they have a student
 
04:38:43.150 --> 04:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
conservation core across the state of
 
04:38:44.949 --> 04:38:44.959 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh and they have a
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
partnership with the state parks uh here
 
04:38:49.990 --> 04:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so that come spring
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
summer and fall uh their members are
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
deployed across the state uh to help
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
provide education to folks who are you
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
know visiting the parks uh provide that
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
Environmental Education uh do Trail work
 
04:39:07.750 --> 04:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh and that is done in deep coordination
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh with the commissioner of natural and
 
04:39:12.349 --> 04:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
cultural resources which oversees the
 
04:39:12.359 --> 04:39:14.390 align:start position:0%
cultural resources which oversees the
state

04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:39:17.949 --> 04:39:17.959 align:start position:0%
parks follow up uh thank you followup um
 
04:39:19.429 --> 04:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
what are the five states that have this
 
04:39:21.189 --> 04:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
program operating already I'll have to
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
get back to on
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
that yeah I can get back to with the
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
five states that currently have it and
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
the five states that are shovel ready
 
04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
and that are getting some private
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.430 --> 04:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
running okay I have a question for
 
04:39:41.310 --> 04:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.788 --> 04:39:45.798 align:start position:0%
um on line 28 of page one of the bill
 
04:39:49.230 --> 04:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
says develop a sustainable member
 
04:39:49.240 --> 04:39:51.350 align:start position:0%
says develop a sustainable member
recruitment

04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
strategy could you expand on that by
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
telling me how many people you envision
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
this core being comprised of and since
 
04:40:06.270 --> 04:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
americore enabling legislation said that
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
this this organization can't compete
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
with the private sector or the public
 
04:40:13.270 --> 04:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
sector for
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
employees where are these people going
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
to come from so what is what exactly
 
04:40:20.110 --> 04:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
does this develop a sustainable member
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
recruitment uh strategy mean yeah so
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question chairman I think
 
04:40:28.470 --> 04:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
the you know a a member recruitment
 
04:40:32.270 --> 04:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
strategy first is defining uh you know
 
04:40:34.868 --> 04:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
what are the ages of the Corp members I
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
think oftentimes you see in these youth
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
cores it's 17 to 25 so you get a mix of
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
folks uh who may have just graduated
 
04:40:44.230 --> 04:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
from high school may have dropped out of
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
high school and are working to get their
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
GED but also want some on the job work
 
04:40:50.830 --> 04:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
training uh you get folks who are taking
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
a gap year between uh high school and
 
04:40:56.110 --> 04:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
college say I I want some time off from
 
04:40:59.310 --> 04:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
school but I want to develop uh myself
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
and maybe get some Focus before I start
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
paying a lot of money to go to college
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh you can get some folks who have
 
04:41:08.110 --> 04:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
finished a two years's ba uh uh
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
associates degree at a community college
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
who are considering going on uh to uh
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
get their their bachelor's degree at a
 
04:41:17.990 --> 04:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
four-year institution you could get
 
04:41:20.750 --> 04:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
folks like me who had just wrapped up
 
04:41:22.868 --> 04:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
their bachelor's degree and were
 
04:41:25.230 --> 04:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about going to grad school uh
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
but wanted to get some practical Real
 
04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
World Experience uh in the meantime I
 
04:41:32.030 --> 04:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
think a a comprehensive recruitment
 
04:41:36.510 --> 04:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
strategy uh really helps to Define uh
 
04:41:38.070 --> 04:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
what types of applicants you're looking
 
04:41:40.510 --> 04:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
for because it could be one of those
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
areas it could be a you know just for
 
04:41:45.310 --> 04:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity youth who are out of school
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
and out of work who didn't get their
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
high school diploma and this is a way to
 
04:41:52.750 --> 04:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
get them back on track um or it could be
 
04:41:55.110 --> 04:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
a mix of all of them because in my
 
04:41:57.030 --> 04:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
humble opinion one of the most brilliant
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
things about civilian national service
 
04:42:00.150 --> 04:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
in this country is it brings together
 
04:42:01.868 --> 04:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
diverse young people from different
 
04:42:03.868 --> 04:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and walks of life to learn
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
from each other
 
04:42:07.550 --> 04:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh to realize how much we actually have
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
in common to get people working together
 
04:42:11.230 --> 04:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
to deliver results and make a difference
 
04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
for their community on something that
 
04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
they're really passionate about um and
 
04:42:17.230 --> 04:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
so I would like to see it be one of
 
04:42:18.990 --> 04:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
those all of the above approaches but
 
04:42:20.590 --> 04:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
that member recruitment strategy is
 
04:42:23.150 --> 04:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
something that uh you know funders
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
whether we're talking about americore
 
04:42:26.190 --> 04:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
and the federal government or we're
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
talking about the New Hampshire
 
04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
charitable Foundation who this you know
 
04:42:31.948 --> 04:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
this this fiscal sponsor could go to and
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
say hey we've got this new idea would
 
04:42:35.150 --> 04:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
you be interested in funding a small
 
04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
five person program um they're going to
 
04:42:40.990 --> 04:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
be looking for answers to that question
 
04:42:42.628 --> 04:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
now in terms of the size of the core
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about you know you
 
04:42:46.110 --> 04:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
you were asking that question directly I
 
04:42:48.150 --> 04:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
think it could be I've seen successful
 
04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
cores that have uh as many as 150 people
 
04:42:53.910 --> 04:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
that are serving all across the city of
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
Boston and in underserved Public Schools
 
04:42:59.070 --> 04:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
um but I've also seen programs that have
 
04:43:01.470 --> 04:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
just three members uh who are do doing
 
04:43:03.708 --> 04:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
something very specific for uh a
 
04:43:05.550 --> 04:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit or organization to help
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
fulfill their mission so I think it
 
04:43:09.390 --> 04:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
could be any size but I think you you
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
should rest easy knowing that uh no Amer
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
Corp members will be displacing any
 
04:43:16.910 --> 04:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
other employee whether you're talking
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
about a public private or nonprofit
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
sector uh organization so as a followup
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
would these people be paid they receive
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
a living stipan so it's it's not it's
 
04:43:31.230 --> 04:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a small living step I
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
think my when I was serving in the core
 
04:43:36.030 --> 04:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
and this was uh back in
 
04:43:39.910 --> 04:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
2005 um you know we were making I think
 
04:43:42.830 --> 04:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
it was like $275 every couple weeks so
 
04:43:44.430 --> 04:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
it was something to to help pay for
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
basic living expenses um you know
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
knowing that we were serving our
 
04:43:50.430 --> 04:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
communities and serving our
 
04:43:52.510 --> 04:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
country and then you get that education
 
04:43:54.430 --> 04:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
award at the end which is really the the
 
04:43:55.990 --> 04:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
driving thing that you know when things
 
04:43:57.430 --> 04:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
get really tough three quarters of the
 
04:43:59.470 --> 04:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
way through your service here um you
 
04:44:00.670 --> 04:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
know you've got that kind of light at
 
04:44:01.708 --> 04:44:01.718 align:start position:0%
the end of the tunnel knowing that you
 
04:44:03.788 --> 04:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
can pay back some of your loans from
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
college so earlier you mentioned that
 
04:44:09.230 --> 04:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
some of these volunteers or some of
 
04:44:12.628 --> 04:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
these uh service organization folks
 
04:44:15.990 --> 04:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
would help towns with technical assist
 
04:44:18.750 --> 04:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
assistance if they wanted to install
 
04:44:21.628 --> 04:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
some solar panels or so on and so forth
 
04:44:23.948 --> 04:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
yeah how are you going to attract people
 
04:44:26.550 --> 04:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
who have that kind of background and
 
04:44:28.788 --> 04:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
expertise if all they're going to be
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
paid is a a simple stipend to help them
 
04:44:35.590 --> 04:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
meet their living expenses yeah thanks
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
for the follow-up question I think there
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
are a number of different reasons why
 
04:44:43.230 --> 04:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
people serve in in these cores some
 
04:44:46.150 --> 04:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes people are uh trying to
 
04:44:48.510 --> 04:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
rebound from a negative experience that
 
04:44:49.990 --> 04:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
they had and they're looking for an
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh learn some new skills
 
04:44:55.510 --> 04:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
um knowing that there's some really good
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
training that's involved uh with
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
americore and a national network you
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
know I think when we talk about these 10
 
04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
programs that you know by the end of
 
04:45:04.750 --> 04:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
this year will be up and running across
 
04:45:06.510 --> 04:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
the country there's a lot of information
 
04:45:09.030 --> 04:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
sharing there's a lot of uh you know
 
04:45:10.910 --> 04:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
training that will be shared between
 
04:45:10.920 --> 04:45:11.750 align:start position:0%
training that will be shared between
those

04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:45:14.590 --> 04:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
organizations um you know I also think
 
04:45:16.590 --> 04:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
that there are you know a number of
 
04:45:19.670 --> 04:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
employers that are looking for uh
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
employees who are entry level uh but who
 
04:45:26.470 --> 04:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
do have a little bit of experience and
 
04:45:28.150 --> 04:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
and and want to want to know that
 
04:45:31.070 --> 04:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
they've worked through this this topic
 
04:45:33.030 --> 04:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
before you know they've done some things
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
to uh prove prove that this is something
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
that they're interested in have some
 
04:45:39.550 --> 04:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
skills in and I think americore provides
 
04:45:41.830 --> 04:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
a really great entrylevel opportunity
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
for young people to uh to prove prove
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
that they're committed to seeing it
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
through for you know a full year 1700
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
hours of service over 12 months um but
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
also enough that they say yeah I'm
 
04:45:56.470 --> 04:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
interested in continuing to do this
 
04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.628 --> 04:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
job uh representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:46:04.708 --> 04:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering um so it sounds
 
04:46:09.430 --> 04:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
like americore sort of acts as an
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program I mean people are
 
04:46:13.150 --> 04:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
learning skills and they're they're
 
04:46:15.708 --> 04:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
going forward are there any statistics
 
04:46:18.910 --> 04:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
on um how many positions lead to a
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
full-time job following the the the
 
04:46:24.910 --> 04:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
service uh yes thanks for the question
 
04:46:26.550 --> 04:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
there is actually there's some research
 
04:46:29.548 --> 04:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
maybe about five years ago um that
 
04:46:32.750 --> 04:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
actually talks about uh how employers
 
04:46:36.510 --> 04:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
are looking for this type of person uh
 
04:46:38.230 --> 04:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
that they're actually a really good fit
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
and that they uh you know are committed
 
04:46:43.430 --> 04:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
to doing the work uh I think so often HR
 
04:46:45.948 --> 04:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
departments are uh you know trying to
 
04:46:47.670 --> 04:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do especially in a
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
job market like we have right now um but
 
04:46:53.310 --> 04:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
if someone has uh a year of americore on
 
04:46:55.270 --> 04:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
their application and that they saw that
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
through to completion um they really
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
jump out of the pile so I can get you
 
04:47:01.948 --> 04:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
it's a you know 25 page report um but I
 
04:47:03.270 --> 04:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
can send that around to the committee as
 
04:47:03.280 --> 04:47:05.110 align:start position:0%
can send that around to the committee as
well

04:47:05.110 --> 04:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:47:07.110 --> 04:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Wilhelm
 
04:47:09.070 --> 04:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
for introducing this
 
04:47:11.070 --> 04:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
bill one more question from
 
04:47:13.948 --> 04:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington thank you um
 
04:47:15.868 --> 04:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
you you follow up to what the chairman
 
04:47:17.470 --> 04:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
just asked about getting qualified
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
people let's assume you can you can get
 
04:47:21.230 --> 04:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
qualified people now you talked about
 
04:47:23.150 --> 04:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
people going to a town or a school
 
04:47:25.628 --> 04:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
district and helping them uh do the
 
04:47:27.510 --> 04:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
analysis for solar and how big and all
 
04:47:29.628 --> 04:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
this other stuff and yet you're not
 
04:47:31.230 --> 04:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
going to replace any workers in the
 
04:47:33.310 --> 04:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
private sector okay I own a solar farm
 
04:47:36.190 --> 04:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
for a solar uh company for example now
 
04:47:38.030 --> 04:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
instead of hiring me they're going to
 
04:47:40.750 --> 04:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
get this discount or free help from uh
 
04:47:43.868 --> 04:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
this core of yours so I lose money and I
 
04:47:45.628 --> 04:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
don't hire as many people as I would
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm only doing maybe the final
 
04:47:50.430 --> 04:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
installation but none of the design and
 
04:47:52.150 --> 04:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
the Grant application and all that other
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
stuff that I'd be doing otherwise so it
 
04:47:54.830 --> 04:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
seems like to me you're going to be
 
04:47:56.910 --> 04:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
taking away jobs from people in the
 
04:47:59.310 --> 04:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
private sector and substituting with
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
these government subsidized jobs at low
 
04:48:04.510 --> 04:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
pay thanks for the question uh I think
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
right now what we're seeing is local
 
04:48:07.910 --> 04:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
school districts saying they can't
 
04:48:10.270 --> 04:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
afford the technical assistance to apply
 
04:48:11.830 --> 04:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
for the grants that they need to do
 
04:48:15.708 --> 04:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
their solar installs and so if well I
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
can send that article around I mean it
 
04:48:20.270 --> 04:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
was something from July uh if that's the
 
04:48:22.270 --> 04:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
barrier that is keeping that school
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
district from installing solar and
 
04:48:26.708 --> 04:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
decreasing uh the utility bills for
 
04:48:28.830 --> 04:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
their municipality then I think that's
 
04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
money well spent but you know it's up to
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
you uh to decide what to do with this
 
04:48:34.830 --> 04:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you chairman and
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
thanks to the committee I appreciate the
 
04:48:39.868 --> 04:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you all right next up
 
04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call forward the honorable
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
Tim Ean from Sugar Hill New Hampshire
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
representing wmcc and I'm sure he will
 
04:48:50.910 --> 04:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
tell us what that
 
04:48:53.070 --> 04:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
is thank you Mr chair thank you members
 
04:48:55.230 --> 04:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee um for the record
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
Timothy Ean from Sugar Hill I'm uh the
 
04:48:59.110 --> 04:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development consultant at
 
04:49:00.510 --> 04:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
White Mountain Community College in
 
04:49:02.590 --> 04:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
Littleton and Berlin as well as a
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
part-time faculty at Northern Vermont
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
University which is now becoming part of
 
04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
Vermont State University so too many
 
04:49:12.270 --> 04:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
schools that that I work for um I'm here
 
04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
to support this bill um I've had two
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
unique experiences one uh in the media
 
04:49:19.948 --> 04:49:19.958 align:start position:0%
Services World serving as a media vendor
 
04:49:22.750 --> 04:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
for City year Boston in the mar cor and
 
04:49:25.948 --> 04:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
I have firsthand seen the impact that
 
04:49:28.510 --> 04:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
civilian Community cores can have on a
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and I think that this is a
 
04:49:34.510 --> 04:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
valuable effort that this committee
 
04:49:38.110 --> 04:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
this committee to study this type of
 
04:49:40.390 --> 04:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
legislation would be important to have
 
04:49:44.510 --> 04:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
as well in my roles at as a part-time
 
04:49:47.310 --> 04:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
faculty at Vermont State University we
 
04:49:49.548 --> 04:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
have an outdoor education tourism and
 
04:49:52.470 --> 04:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
Leadership program where students work
 
04:49:55.230 --> 04:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
in and around the community and part of
 
04:49:57.788 --> 04:49:57.798 align:start position:0%
their goal is to get additional
 
04:50:00.788 --> 04:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
certifications and they work with
 
04:50:03.990 --> 04:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
organizations like this type of civilian
 
04:50:06.868 --> 04:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
commission that could allow them to get
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
certifications that could allow them to
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
graduate faster therefore save more
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
money um for example they actually have
 
04:50:16.590 --> 04:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
a program with the state of Maine where
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
students there go study Avalanche
 
04:50:20.350 --> 04:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
training and most of these students work
 
04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
in within the ski industry so they're
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
able to get this certification through a
 
04:50:27.750 --> 04:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
community core organization and instead
 
04:50:29.628 --> 04:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
of having to pay tuition to take a class
 
04:50:30.788 --> 04:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
they've gotten the certification over
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
the summer or the winter and they can
 
04:50:35.830 --> 04:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
graduate faster um from my role within
 
04:50:38.190 --> 04:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
the White Mountain Community College I
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
see a lot of students that come to
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
school because they think they need to
 
04:50:43.350 --> 04:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
go to college and some students aren't
 
04:50:45.150 --> 04:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
ready and I think a core like this could
 
04:50:46.910 --> 04:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
allow students to take a gap year to
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
explore themselves their skills their
 
04:50:52.510 --> 04:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
interpersonal skills their ability
 
04:50:54.670 --> 04:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
to engage with other people in the
 
04:50:57.230 --> 04:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
community from different backgrounds and
 
04:51:00.190 --> 04:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
it would allow them to be able to create
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
some opportunities sorry about that for
 
04:51:07.750 --> 04:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
for themselves and that type of
 
04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
Readiness would then allow them to go
 
04:51:11.430 --> 04:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
back to school with more focus with more
 
04:51:12.190 --> 04:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
understanding of what they want to
 
04:51:14.230 --> 04:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish and hopefully again therefore
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
be more cost-effective if they're going
 
04:51:20.270 --> 04:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
to go to college or Community College um
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
part of what's important from an
 
04:51:24.390 --> 04:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
educator point of view as well as a past
 
04:51:26.990 --> 04:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislator is that finding ways to keep
 
04:51:29.548 --> 04:51:29.558 align:start position:0%
our students involved in our community
 
04:51:33.310 --> 04:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
and be civilian focused uh Community
 
04:51:33.320 --> 04:51:34.830 align:start position:0%
and be civilian focused uh Community
focused

04:51:34.830 --> 04:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
focused
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
is an important effort and I applaud any
 
04:51:40.510 --> 04:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
bill that does that and so the fact that
 
04:51:43.110 --> 04:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is just an effort to study the
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create this would be an
 
04:51:47.868 --> 04:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
important start and that's what I want
 
04:51:49.868 --> 04:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
to come and testify in front of you all
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
today thank
 
04:51:54.590 --> 04:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you for being here
 
04:51:56.190 --> 04:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
04:51:56.200 --> 04:51:56.990 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
for

04:51:56.990 --> 04:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:52:00.070 --> 04:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you chairman uh
 
04:52:04.230 --> 04:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
so interesting you uh relayed how you
 
04:52:07.750 --> 04:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
can get certifications without going to
 
04:52:07.760 --> 04:52:09.310 align:start position:0%
can get certifications without going to
school

04:52:09.310 --> 04:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:52:12.990 --> 04:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
um what is the community college system
 
04:52:16.548 --> 04:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
think about that pulling away students
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
from their
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
potential that program is through
 
04:52:22.868 --> 04:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
Vermont State University so it's not
 
04:52:24.548 --> 04:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
it's not the Community College of New
 
04:52:26.910 --> 04:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's in the state of Vermont
 
04:52:29.430 --> 04:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
actually the school
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
IM engages students to do that part of
 
04:52:36.110 --> 04:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
the challenge that students in Vermont
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
have is the cost of Education um Vermont
 
04:52:42.628 --> 04:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire have very high tuition
 
04:52:46.190 --> 04:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
so there are programs at Vermont State
 
04:52:47.910 --> 04:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
University where they endorse students
 
04:52:49.230 --> 04:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
getting certifications through
 
04:52:51.150 --> 04:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
thirdparty organizations to help the
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
students matriculate faster through the
 
04:52:55.270 --> 04:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
system they actually think that students
 
04:52:58.548 --> 04:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
will stay in school and graduate if they
 
04:53:01.070 --> 04:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
are able to find more cost-effective
 
04:53:03.190 --> 04:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
ways to find thirdparty certifications
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
program further
 
04:53:13.230 --> 04:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:53:15.150 --> 04:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I was just going to ask the
 
04:53:18.030 --> 04:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
same question about uh school tuitions
 
04:53:19.670 --> 04:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
and but just highlight the fact that we
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
have the highest in state tuition rates
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
of any state in the country and uh you
 
04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
know I was going to ask you would that
 
04:53:27.788 --> 04:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
do you think that would help retain
 
04:53:30.190 --> 04:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
students and high school students from
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in New Hampshire if the if
 
04:53:33.868 --> 04:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
a program like this was available so
 
04:53:35.470 --> 04:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
that they could lower their University
 
04:53:38.590 --> 04:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
and college tuition costs and therefore
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know you could keep more students in
 
04:53:42.350 --> 04:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
the state is that is that something that
 
04:53:44.590 --> 04:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
you envision with this program I've been
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
a part-time faculty in three different
 
04:53:49.830 --> 04:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
institutions for the last 17 years and
 
04:53:52.990 --> 04:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
when students aren't ready for
 
04:53:56.190 --> 04:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
college that's a problem and that
 
04:53:58.110 --> 04:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
actually ends up hurting schools
 
04:54:00.350 --> 04:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
students come in they matriculate and
 
04:54:02.190 --> 04:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
then they drop out I think by giving
 
04:54:04.150 --> 04:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
students an opportunity to take a gap
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
year through a civilian core like this
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
build their skills they then come ready
 
04:54:11.910 --> 04:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
for school they do well or do better
 
04:54:15.270 --> 04:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
than they expected and they are
 
04:54:18.548 --> 04:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
more fiscally responsible with spending
 
04:54:20.750 --> 04:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
their money to go through college so I
 
04:54:22.390 --> 04:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
think these are the type of things that
 
04:54:23.948 --> 04:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
maybe give them skill sets that they
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
didn't know they needed before they
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
showed up to the college classroom when
 
04:54:30.750 --> 04:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:33.150 --> 04:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
classroom representative lii has a
 
04:54:34.868 --> 04:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:54:38.350 --> 04:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I uh keep hearing
 
04:54:40.350 --> 04:54:40.360 align:start position:0%
mention of college Gap years and so
 
04:54:43.030 --> 04:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
forth and I wonder whe is there any
 
04:54:45.708 --> 04:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity for low-income um
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
individuals to be involved in this
 
04:54:50.628 --> 04:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
because uh to live on a the stipend is
 
04:54:53.190 --> 04:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
not possible and for someone who's low
 
04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
income you've got to have a real job
 
04:54:57.310 --> 04:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
that pays the bills now not a year from
 
04:55:00.190 --> 04:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
now not uh sometime in the future well I
 
04:55:02.110 --> 04:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
would imagine that's than thank you for
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
the question I imagine that was part of
 
04:55:08.430 --> 04:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
what would be studied in this is is this
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
available to students who have graduated
 
04:55:12.670 --> 04:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
col high school and are still living at
 
04:55:15.708 --> 04:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
home so they have some type of financial
 
04:55:18.510 --> 04:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
structure already or they have some
 
04:55:20.270 --> 04:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
other type
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
of employment on top of what they're
 
04:55:25.670 --> 04:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
doing in this program I'm not sure
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's part of why I think it's
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
important to have a committee to study
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.400 --> 04:55:35.470 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:55:35.470 --> 04:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think you're done
 
04:55:36.958 --> 04:55:38.548 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think you're done
with

04:55:38.548 --> 04:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:55:41.430 --> 04:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
me sorry I had a side conversation going
 
04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
on no problem any further questions for
 
04:55:46.830 --> 04:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Egan okay seeing none we thank you
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
for testifying for us today I'd like to
 
04:55:54.910 --> 04:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh ask Nick Paul of clean energy New
 
04:55:56.910 --> 04:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to give us his perspective on
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:02.320 --> 04:56:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:56:05.670 --> 04:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I'll be
 
04:56:07.510 --> 04:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
extremely brief I think I can do this in
 
04:56:10.110 --> 04:56:10.120 align:start position:0%
three minutes uh but I will expect one
 
04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:15.788 --> 04:56:15.798 align:start position:0%
reward uh I I was just going to talk
 
04:56:15.798 --> 04:56:17.390 align:start position:0%
reward uh I I was just going to talk
about

04:56:17.390 --> 04:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:56:19.310 --> 04:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh with you today but this
 
04:56:21.270 --> 04:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
seems like a a good opportunity based on
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
the conversation you just had with
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
representative wilham to talk about um
 
04:56:28.948 --> 04:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
our energy circuit Rider program at
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire um so when
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about having folks on the
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
ground providing technical assistance uh
 
04:56:38.628 --> 04:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
to municipalities and small businesses
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
that is work that we are doing at clean
 
04:56:43.470 --> 04:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire currently um we
 
04:56:48.110 --> 04:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
have several ecrs uh around the state um
 
04:56:51.070 --> 04:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that there is a a
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
persistent demand for those Services um
 
04:56:57.430 --> 04:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
especially on the grant writing side um
 
04:56:59.948 --> 04:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's my personal opinion that
 
04:57:01.470 --> 04:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
having more boots on the ground in that
 
04:57:03.830 --> 04:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
area would not be uh
 
04:57:06.548 --> 04:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
usurping uh anyone's prerogative or
 
04:57:08.390 --> 04:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
financial interests so
 
04:57:11.230 --> 04:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
that's something to think about um in
 
04:57:12.788 --> 04:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
organization like ours would be
 
04:57:14.788 --> 04:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about partnering with a
 
04:57:16.670 --> 04:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
program like this or with a maror to
 
04:57:19.470 --> 04:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
train folks uh to assist our energy
 
04:57:21.270 --> 04:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
circuit Riders and providing more of
 
04:57:22.990 --> 04:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
these services to more
 
04:57:23.000 --> 04:57:24.548 align:start position:0%
these services to more
communities

04:57:24.548 --> 04:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I would think about that
 
04:57:31.310 --> 04:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
um someone asked which states uh already
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
have these programs um so it's my
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh Washington
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
Connecticut California Maine and
 
04:57:40.990 --> 04:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
Colorado uh are those states that
 
04:57:44.590 --> 04:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
already uh have one of these entities uh
 
04:57:46.590 --> 04:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
stood up and and those that are looking
 
04:57:49.150 --> 04:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
at creating their own programs through
 
04:57:51.470 --> 04:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
public private Partnerships uh are as
 
04:57:54.350 --> 04:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
diverse as Arizona Utah Minnesota North
 
04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
Carolina and
 
04:57:55.840 --> 04:57:57.750 align:start position:0%
Carolina and
Maryland

04:57:57.750 --> 04:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
Maryland
 
04:58:01.548 --> 04:58:01.558 align:start position:0%
um the growth in the clean energy uh
 
04:58:04.948 --> 04:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
sector uh as well as a a shortage in in
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
filling those good paying jobs uh are
 
04:58:11.190 --> 04:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
well documented I've cited
 
04:58:13.470 --> 04:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
um just one article from the New
 
04:58:15.788 --> 04:58:15.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Business Review as well as the
 
04:58:18.910 --> 04:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
US Department of Energy's uh annual
 
04:58:21.670 --> 04:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
energy employment uh by state report
 
04:58:23.230 --> 04:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
just to wet your beak there are a lot
 
04:58:26.310 --> 04:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
more uh materials uh that cover these
 
04:58:28.910 --> 04:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
issues uh and I'd be happy to pass those
 
04:58:32.110 --> 04:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
along as as interest dictates
 
04:58:32.120 --> 04:58:34.110 align:start position:0%
along as as interest dictates
so

04:58:34.110 --> 04:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:38.470 --> 04:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:41.310 --> 04:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
Paul seeing none thank thanks a lot
 
04:58:43.948 --> 04:58:43.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here and the last
 
04:58:46.110 --> 04:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
speaker on this bill will be
 
04:58:48.190 --> 04:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
Rob excuse
 
04:58:48.200 --> 04:58:50.670 align:start position:0%
Rob excuse
me

04:58:50.670 --> 04:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:58:53.990 --> 04:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
oh Rob Werner I guess it is of the
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
league of conservation V voters correct
 
04:58:56.400 --> 04:59:02.030 align:start position:0%
league of conservation V voters correct
Rob

04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:05.470 --> 04:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
welcome now there we go thanks Mr
 
04:59:07.150 --> 04:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
chairman yes that's correct Rob Werner
 
04:59:08.910 --> 04:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
I'm the state director for the league of
 
04:59:11.110 --> 04:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
conservation voters here in New
 
04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we certainly are very
 
04:59:14.590 --> 04:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
supportive of this concept and I really
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
see this bill as a conversation starter
 
04:59:20.548 --> 04:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity for the legislature to
 
04:59:23.548 --> 04:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
provide some opportunity for input to
 
04:59:25.548 --> 04:59:25.558 align:start position:0%
provide um some credibility of
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
leadership that you all have in terms of
 
04:59:29.590 --> 04:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
convening this
 
04:59:32.868 --> 04:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
conversation and um I believe that also
 
04:59:34.350 --> 04:59:34.360 align:start position:0%
that that it it will provide an
 
04:59:36.310 --> 04:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity greater opportunity
 
04:59:39.548 --> 04:59:39.558 align:start position:0%
additional opportunities to involve uh
 
04:59:42.910 --> 04:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
folks in our communities to be helpful
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
to add to what is already H happening in
 
04:59:48.030 --> 04:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
many communities in terms of community
 
04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
service and needed programs and and
 
04:59:53.830 --> 04:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
perspectives uh on how to actually help
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
people and help communities become more
 
04:59:59.470 --> 04:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
resilient uh to provide opportunities
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
for more information Pathways of
 
05:00:04.990 --> 05:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge that kind of opportunity so I
 
05:00:08.230 --> 05:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
really would urge you to um uh support
 
05:00:08.240 --> 05:00:08.990 align:start position:0%
really would urge you to um uh support
this

05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:00:11.948 --> 05:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
legislation again it's a conversation
 
05:00:14.548 --> 05:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
starter and I think that you have an
 
05:00:18.270 --> 05:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
ability As Leaders of our state to play
 
05:00:20.910 --> 05:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
a large part in that conversation as you
 
05:00:20.920 --> 05:00:23.590 align:start position:0%
a large part in that conversation as you
well

05:00:23.590 --> 05:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
should okay thank you very much for your
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
a contribution to this conversation
 
05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chair um
 
05:00:39.150 --> 05:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um Rob um so my
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
concern I mean this is a great program
 
05:00:42.750 --> 05:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
you know I I talked um I did an
 
05:00:44.788 --> 05:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
interview recently with somebody in town
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh Anita creger who who works with Eagle
 
05:00:49.868 --> 05:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
Scouts and she she told me that that
 
05:00:52.868 --> 05:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
people corporations look for Eagle Scout
 
05:00:54.628 --> 05:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
you businesses because that's a plus
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
they want to hire those people that's
 
05:00:57.750 --> 05:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
what representative willhem was talking
 
05:01:01.230 --> 05:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
about the ages of these are 17 to 25 so
 
05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
I assume they're still on their parents
 
05:01:03.280 --> 05:01:04.708 align:start position:0%
I assume they're still on their parents
health

05:01:04.708 --> 05:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:01:07.470 --> 05:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
insurance so that's one of my concerns
 
05:01:10.030 --> 05:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
is is are these kids protected while
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're in this program and I I think
 
05:01:13.150 --> 05:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that needs to
 
05:01:16.948 --> 05:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
be figured out um
 
05:01:19.030 --> 05:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
but now what was the other thing I was
 
05:01:22.230 --> 05:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
going to say um oh so so yeah so they
 
05:01:24.590 --> 05:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
get a nominal amount of money what is to
 
05:01:27.390 --> 05:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
keep a private employer from abusing
 
05:01:29.430 --> 05:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
them making them work 40 hours a week
 
05:01:31.070 --> 05:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
for this nominal amount of money which
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
is even less than minimum wage
 
05:01:36.190 --> 05:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
well um I have to say I don't
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the answer to that very
 
05:01:41.470 --> 05:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
specific question but I think that uh
 
05:01:42.910 --> 05:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
given the fact that there are five
 
05:01:44.670 --> 05:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
states that have these programs up and
 
05:01:46.230 --> 05:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
running and that there are five other
 
05:01:48.470 --> 05:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
states that are looking at it I think
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity there to talk
 
05:01:54.590 --> 05:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
with colleagues uh in other states um
 
05:01:55.910 --> 05:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
and also to look at the existing
 
05:01:58.628 --> 05:01:58.638 align:start position:0%
americore program how does that operate
 
05:02:01.150 --> 05:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
and how does um how does the concern
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
that you're raising how that handled in
 
05:02:07.830 --> 05:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
other avenues of service
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative
 
05:02:16.390 --> 05:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr Warner for taking my question
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned several times service
 
05:02:24.190 --> 05:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
and um I think that really is the the
 
05:02:27.030 --> 05:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
point of the bill um this legislature
 
05:02:29.708 --> 05:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
has had um several bills recently
 
05:02:32.030 --> 05:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
discussing how schools were operating in
 
05:02:34.788 --> 05:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
terms of Civic iics education and I
 
05:02:36.310 --> 05:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could say anything about
 
05:02:38.590 --> 05:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
your experience in the nonprofit world
 
05:02:41.750 --> 05:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
with the value of of teaching people
 
05:02:43.788 --> 05:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
what service in community is at an early
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
age because I think those are the people
 
05:02:47.310 --> 05:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
that become the
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
most um useful citizens or purposeful
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
citizens even in retirement so um and I
 
05:02:56.830 --> 05:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
think to me that's the purpose of this
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill right is to have a focal point so
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
that youth in the state will have some
 
05:03:03.750 --> 05:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
place to go in ter Ms of figuring out if
 
05:03:06.230 --> 05:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
they want to serve how they can
 
05:03:10.590 --> 05:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
serve well I think there's um certainly
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
a real concept here of doing something
 
05:03:16.670 --> 05:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
for your community that's larger than
 
05:03:19.230 --> 05:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
yourself and I think that has a strong
 
05:03:22.350 --> 05:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
societal benefit that type of community
 
05:03:25.948 --> 05:03:25.958 align:start position:0%
building also know that employers um for
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
later in life um I think would be
 
05:03:31.708 --> 05:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
positive about these kind of experiences
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
because employ employers is largely
 
05:03:38.110 --> 05:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
looking for folks that um are team uh
 
05:03:41.270 --> 05:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
builders that are fast Learners that are
 
05:03:43.708 --> 05:03:43.718 align:start position:0%
open to new ideas and way of doing
 
05:03:46.390 --> 05:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
things not so much necessarily the
 
05:03:48.030 --> 05:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
specific training because what I hear
 
05:03:51.548 --> 05:03:51.558 align:start position:0%
from employers is we can train folks to
 
05:03:54.990 --> 05:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
do the specific jobs and skills we're
 
05:03:58.830 --> 05:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
looking for um folks that have developed
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
Community skills interpersonal skills
 
05:04:06.510 --> 05:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
and and uh Community orientation um that
 
05:04:08.110 --> 05:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
is something that's important around
 
05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
this so I think that you bring up a very
 
05:04:13.190 --> 05:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
good concept about that in terms of
 
05:04:14.788 --> 05:04:14.798 align:start position:0%
civics and being connected to the
 
05:04:17.830 --> 05:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
community and how that really builds our
 
05:04:20.230 --> 05:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
democracy really in the larger sense in
 
05:04:22.110 --> 05:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
the larger sense that we think of that
 
05:04:24.350 --> 05:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we interact with each
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
other and how we exchange ideas and how
 
05:04:29.788 --> 05:04:29.798 align:start position:0%
is it that we are working together
 
05:04:32.270 --> 05:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
despite our differences to move things
 
05:04:34.670 --> 05:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
forward forward in a positive
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
direction so representative Ros has a
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh I want
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
to ask just my question is in followup
 
05:04:48.270 --> 05:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
kind of responding to the concern that
 
05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
was expressed by a couple of my
 
05:04:49.920 --> 05:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
was expressed by a couple of my
colleagues

05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
about the potential
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
for these core members
 
05:05:01.548 --> 05:05:01.558 align:start position:0%
to doing be doing things that displace
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know private
 
05:05:05.948 --> 05:05:05.958 align:start position:0%
businesses um seems to me that in the
 
05:05:08.910 --> 05:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
age group we're talking about 17 to 25
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's pretty unlikely that too many of
 
05:05:15.190 --> 05:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
folks who might volunteer for something
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
like this are going to have technical
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
skills like engineering skills to design
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
a solar project or or a Wetlands
 
05:05:27.830 --> 05:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
restoration project or something like
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
that so isn't it would you agree that
 
05:05:34.628 --> 05:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
the the likely role and I know I partly
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
because I know you've served a number of
 
05:05:38.548 --> 05:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
terms on the conquered city council
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
right um Municipal
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
space um isn't it more isn't it likely
 
05:05:47.948 --> 05:05:47.958 align:start position:0%
that the roles that folks in a core like
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
this are going to serve if they are
 
05:05:54.070 --> 05:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
placed with a municipality or with a
 
05:05:56.390 --> 05:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization such as
 
05:05:58.750 --> 05:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
lcv is even though they're going to get
 
05:06:01.310 --> 05:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
some small stien isn't the role more
 
05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
likely to be like a volunteer staff
 
05:06:07.230 --> 05:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
member with say the city planning
 
05:06:08.510 --> 05:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
department or the town planning
 
05:06:10.750 --> 05:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
department or whatever nonprofit it
 
05:06:10.760 --> 05:06:12.110 align:start position:0%
department or whatever nonprofit it
might

05:06:12.110 --> 05:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
might
 
05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
be because staff of these organizations
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
are usually over they have more work
 
05:06:18.628 --> 05:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
than they can handle and somebody says
 
05:06:20.948 --> 05:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
let's let's have the town undertake you
 
05:06:23.030 --> 05:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
know look at putting a solar array on
 
05:06:25.150 --> 05:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
the municipal landfill or let's have you
 
05:06:26.750 --> 05:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
know a nonprofit that
 
05:06:29.110 --> 05:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
says we know this Wetland needs some
 
05:06:31.628 --> 05:06:31.638 align:start position:0%
restoration but nobody on the staff of
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
those organizations has time to delve
 
05:06:39.470 --> 05:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
into you know the initial fact finding
 
05:06:41.548 --> 05:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
and the initial community outreach and
 
05:06:45.030 --> 05:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
the initial this stuff uh so wouldn't
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
these folks be undertak some sort of
 
05:06:50.670 --> 05:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
volunteer staff member to do the grunt
 
05:06:52.548 --> 05:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
work if you will the grunt work that the
 
05:06:54.110 --> 05:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
you know below the pay grade of the
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
professionals to help that municipality
 
05:06:59.628 --> 05:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
or that or that
 
05:07:02.150 --> 05:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofit put something in motion and
 
05:07:02.160 --> 05:07:02.990 align:start position:0%
nonprofit put something in motion and
and

05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of it may be grant writing in the
 
05:07:08.750 --> 05:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
end to to get money to just but the but
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
these the role that these folks would
 
05:07:13.788 --> 05:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
play is more likely be like kickstarting
 
05:07:15.868 --> 05:07:15.878 align:start position:0%
something that the community or the
 
05:07:18.390 --> 05:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
nonprofit needs I think so because you
 
05:07:20.708 --> 05:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
you bring up a good point at that age um
 
05:07:23.070 --> 05:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
I certainly didn't have a lot of those
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
skills uh when I was 17 years old um but
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
I had some opportunities to do Hands-On
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
work to learn things and to build my own
 
05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
confidence about how I could operate in
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
the world and I think that's part of it
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
too so um it there there's so many
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities or different things that
 
05:07:41.230 --> 05:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
people could be doing I mean from a
 
05:07:43.830 --> 05:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
practical aspect of restoring Wetlands I
 
05:07:46.270 --> 05:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
remember with the old CCC I mean people
 
05:07:47.948 --> 05:07:47.958 align:start position:0%
are actually out there building things
 
05:07:51.030 --> 05:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
that we use today um and that certainly
 
05:07:53.470 --> 05:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
could uh be part of it in terms of
 
05:07:54.868 --> 05:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
helping communities become more
 
05:07:56.670 --> 05:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
resilient and and work on some of the
 
05:07:59.628 --> 05:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
very um practical projects that are
 
05:08:01.990 --> 05:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
needed to do that kind of work and to
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
get to that point um so yes I see I see
 
05:08:08.830 --> 05:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
it as an opportunity of skill building
 
05:08:13.470 --> 05:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
um uh for later in life mostly um and to
 
05:08:15.910 --> 05:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
again build their own confidence make
 
05:08:18.548 --> 05:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
connections and I think bolster their
 
05:08:24.708 --> 05:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:28.470 --> 05:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
experience thank you
 
05:08:31.830 --> 05:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions I'm
 
05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to to that's our last speaker and
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
 
05:08:38.548 --> 05:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:08:42.430 --> 05:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
1499 we will take a five minute break
 
05:08:45.510 --> 05:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
and then we will commence with our fifth
 
05:08:48.190 --> 05:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
and final public hearing of the day at
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:01.120 --> 05:16:18.548 align:start position:0%
 
afternoon

05:16:18.548 --> 05:16:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:22.548 --> 05:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
220 and we are on House Bill
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
1398 and the prime uh sponsor is
 
05:16:28.830 --> 05:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Vose
 
05:16:30.788 --> 05:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
representative oose please introduce
 
05:16:32.990 --> 05:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
your bill
 
05:16:35.788 --> 05:16:35.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr acting chairman and good
 
05:16:38.110 --> 05:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee so
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
I'm here this afternoon to introduce
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
1398 and I have submitted some written
 
05:16:49.590 --> 05:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
testimony which is making its way around
 
05:16:52.590 --> 05:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
the table as I
 
05:16:55.110 --> 05:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
speak this bill seeks to provide
 
05:16:57.270 --> 05:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
transparency and tracking for net
 
05:17:00.030 --> 05:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
metering costs and to ensure that every
 
05:17:02.788 --> 05:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
electric utility customer pays for those
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the costs of net metering and has
 
05:17:08.750 --> 05:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
some way to figure out what those costs
 
05:17:11.708 --> 05:17:11.718 align:start position:0%
are the bill accomplishes these goals by
 
05:17:14.350 --> 05:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
requiring regulated utilities to recover
 
05:17:16.430 --> 05:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
the cost of net metering and group
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
hosting via a stranded cost recovery
 
05:17:22.110 --> 05:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
charge instead of standard rates the
 
05:17:24.190 --> 05:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
bill also expands the definition of
 
05:17:27.310 --> 05:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
stranded cost charges to include net
 
05:17:27.320 --> 05:17:28.830 align:start position:0%
stranded cost charges to include net
metering

05:17:28.830 --> 05:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
metering
 
05:17:31.830 --> 05:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
costs that's the bill as interest
 
05:17:34.430 --> 05:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
produced that definition is probably not
 
05:17:37.990 --> 05:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
necessary and will be removed by an
 
05:17:42.910 --> 05:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow the background on this
 
05:17:51.230 --> 05:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
bill on January 29th of 2021 the Pu
 
05:17:55.390 --> 05:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:57.788 --> 05:17:57.798 align:start position:0%
26450 in which the commission approved a
 
05:17:59.708 --> 05:17:59.718 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement regarding ever
 
05:18:01.548 --> 05:18:01.558 align:start position:0%
source's request to recover cost
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
associated with net metering group
 
05:18:06.110 --> 05:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
hosting via a non- bypassable stranded
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
cost recovery charge this mechanism
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
spreads the cost of net metering to all
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
customers not just default service
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
customers quoting the order quote the
 
05:18:18.670 --> 05:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
commission approves a settlement
 
05:18:20.190 --> 05:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
agreement providing for eversource
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
Energy's recovery of net metering and
 
05:18:23.868 --> 05:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
group host costs through its stranded
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
cost recovery charge rather than through
 
05:18:29.350 --> 05:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
its energy service rate on an equal
 
05:18:31.310 --> 05:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
cense per kilowatt hour basis with
 
05:18:33.750 --> 05:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
corresponding offsets for any wholesale
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
Market Revenue attributable to net
 
05:18:41.310 --> 05:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:43.708 --> 05:18:43.718 align:start position:0%
unquote the state's
 
05:18:46.830 --> 05:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
currently Uh current regulated utilities
 
05:18:48.910 --> 05:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
list stranded cost recovery charges on
 
05:18:51.708 --> 05:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
monthly bills issued to their
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
customers while the components of the
 
05:18:57.548 --> 05:18:57.558 align:start position:0%
SCRC are not listed and can contain
 
05:19:00.390 --> 05:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
other stranded costs customers can be
 
05:19:03.310 --> 05:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
alert to the changes in the
 
05:19:07.150 --> 05:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
charge should this bill become law and
 
05:19:10.470 --> 05:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
seek further information if they so
 
05:19:13.070 --> 05:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
choose thus a consistent mechanism for
 
05:19:15.070 --> 05:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
providing information about net metering
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
costs can help customers understand what
 
05:19:20.230 --> 05:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
their money buys and that is the
 
05:19:24.430 --> 05:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:27.030 --> 05:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
consumers tracking net metering costs
 
05:19:29.190 --> 05:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
over time will provide an accurate
 
05:19:32.110 --> 05:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
picture of its true costs that record
 
05:19:33.990 --> 05:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
can validate studies that predict that
 
05:19:37.750 --> 05:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
net metering costs do not encumber other
 
05:19:39.788 --> 05:19:39.798 align:start position:0%
customers if the record shows the
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
opposite policy makers and Regulators
 
05:19:48.310 --> 05:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
needed as the earlier referenced puc
 
05:19:53.430 --> 05:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
order stipulates utilities can currently
 
05:19:55.190 --> 05:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
recover net metering costs without a
 
05:19:56.310 --> 05:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
change in
 
05:20:00.070 --> 05:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
law eversource has been using its SCRC
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
to recover net metering cost since
 
05:20:05.548 --> 05:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
2022 Unitil uses an external
 
05:20:08.628 --> 05:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
distribution charge rather than an SCRC
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
but this charge doesn't or may not
 
05:20:15.628 --> 05:20:15.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill therefore the language of section
 
05:20:20.670 --> 05:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
two of the
 
05:20:25.150 --> 05:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
bill currently specifies that regulated
 
05:20:27.310 --> 05:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
utilities will use a stranded cost
 
05:20:29.788 --> 05:20:29.798 align:start position:0%
recovery charge to recover net metering
 
05:20:33.030 --> 05:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
costs and amendment I will file tomorrow
 
05:20:35.310 --> 05:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
at exec session I will change the
 
05:20:36.510 --> 05:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
language to
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
read distribution utilities shall
 
05:20:40.590 --> 05:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
recover costs associated with net
 
05:20:42.150 --> 05:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
metering and group hosting through a
 
05:20:45.548 --> 05:20:45.558 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery charge or other
 
05:20:47.788 --> 05:20:47.798 align:start position:0%
non- bypassable charge as approved by
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
the commission as long as those charges
 
05:20:55.070 --> 05:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:58.070 --> 05:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
bills one last thing I'd like
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
to add to the record before I ask to
 
05:21:03.270 --> 05:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
turn it over for
 
05:21:08.430 --> 05:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
questions so I'd like to read aart a bit
 
05:21:12.788 --> 05:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
from pu order number 26450 dated January
 
05:21:12.798 --> 05:21:14.510 align:start position:0%
from pu order number 26450 dated January
29th

05:21:14.510 --> 05:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
29th
 
05:21:17.350 --> 05:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
2021 quoting now quote we find that the
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement represents a just
 
05:21:21.868 --> 05:21:21.878 align:start position:0%
and reasonable treatment of net metering
 
05:21:24.510 --> 05:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
and group host costs and revenues
 
05:21:26.628 --> 05:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
recovery of net metering and group host
 
05:21:28.590 --> 05:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
costs through an
 
05:21:31.948 --> 05:21:31.958 align:start position:0%
SRC Adder is appr appropriate because it
 
05:21:34.830 --> 05:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
addresses the costs in a
 
05:21:38.070 --> 05:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory and non- bypassable
 
05:21:40.070 --> 05:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
manner in addition the current
 
05:21:41.910 --> 05:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
calculation and accounting methods are
 
05:21:44.830 --> 05:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate and would be continued the
 
05:21:46.990 --> 05:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
net cost would be recovered on an equal
 
05:21:49.390 --> 05:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt basis and the
 
05:21:51.590 --> 05:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
applicable CH carrying charge interest
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
rate would be the same as has been
 
05:21:56.110 --> 05:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
applied to other such costs under prior
 
05:21:59.948 --> 05:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:59.958 --> 05:22:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
mechanisms

05:22:02.070 --> 05:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
mechanisms
 
05:22:05.430 --> 05:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
further it goes on to say
 
05:22:09.628 --> 05:22:09.638 align:start position:0%
that we find it appropriate to further
 
05:22:12.350 --> 05:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
investigate whoops sorry that was the
 
05:22:12.360 --> 05:22:14.030 align:start position:0%
investigate whoops sorry that was the
wrong

05:22:14.030 --> 05:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:22:16.030 --> 05:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
sentence they go on to say we have
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed the issues in this proceeding
 
05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
evaluated the appropriateness of the
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
SCRC recovery mechanism and proposed
 
05:22:24.788 --> 05:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
rate treatment for ever sources net
 
05:22:26.670 --> 05:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
metering and group host
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
costs and considered the settlement
 
05:22:30.670 --> 05:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
agreement among the parties and the
 
05:22:30.680 --> 05:22:32.070 align:start position:0%
agreement among the parties and the
staff

05:22:32.070 --> 05:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
staff
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
based on that we find that the
 
05:22:35.390 --> 05:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
provisions of the set settlement
 
05:22:36.990 --> 05:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
agreement are just and reasonable and in
 
05:22:40.270 --> 05:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:44.070 --> 05:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
interest so that is the official record
 
05:22:46.910 --> 05:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
I wanted to establish for this bill and
 
05:22:49.830 --> 05:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
I would now look forward to hearing what
 
05:22:51.670 --> 05:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
questions you have to
 
05:22:54.070 --> 05:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
ask representative
 
05:22:57.070 --> 05:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you uh representative
 
05:23:00.070 --> 05:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas and thank you uh Mr chair for for
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:23:04.470 --> 05:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
um you say that this uh bill will
 
05:23:06.910 --> 05:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
provide added transparency to the the
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
the recovery of net metering costs for
 
05:23:12.350 --> 05:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
for rate payers uh and you say that uh
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
that eversource already uses a stranded
 
05:23:19.548 --> 05:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
uh cost recovery mechanism for for for
 
05:23:22.350 --> 05:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
such a for such a purpose if if that if
 
05:23:23.590 --> 05:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to provide more
 
05:23:26.590 --> 05:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
transparency then why did I would wager
 
05:23:28.708 --> 05:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
that nobody on this committee knew that
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
that eversource was already doing so
 
05:23:35.190 --> 05:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
so I I don't I fail to see how how uh
 
05:23:37.868 --> 05:23:37.878 align:start position:0%
putting the net metering rate on a
 
05:23:39.788 --> 05:23:39.798 align:start position:0%
stranded cost section provides greater
 
05:23:41.670 --> 05:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
transparency that that's not itemized
 
05:23:43.390 --> 05:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
nobody here even knew that they were
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
doing that so can you explain further
 
05:23:49.470 --> 05:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
how that provides transparency for raid
 
05:23:51.990 --> 05:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
pairs well because it's part of stranded
 
05:23:55.830 --> 05:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
cost recovery you can look it up or you
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
can ask you eversource to to give you
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
the data on what those costs are if
 
05:24:05.470 --> 05:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
you're so interested now it's not broken
 
05:24:07.628 --> 05:24:07.638 align:start position:0%
out on your bill all it says on your
 
05:24:09.868 --> 05:24:09.878 align:start position:0%
bill is stranded cost recovery charge
 
05:24:13.070 --> 05:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
and then there's a number so you can't
 
05:24:15.310 --> 05:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
see what part of that is net metering
 
05:24:17.788 --> 05:24:17.798 align:start position:0%
cost but you can find out if you now
 
05:24:21.070 --> 05:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
know that net metering costs are in
 
05:24:23.310 --> 05:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery
 
05:24:23.320 --> 05:24:24.948 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery
charge

05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
charge
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
followup follow oh so you can so if I
 
05:24:32.350 --> 05:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
can interpret your answer you you can by
 
05:24:34.310 --> 05:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
further digging into into the data on
 
05:24:36.590 --> 05:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
your bill you can find out what part of
 
05:24:39.548 --> 05:24:39.558 align:start position:0%
the stranded recovery cost uh would is
 
05:24:42.350 --> 05:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
entailed through net metering uh
 
05:24:45.030 --> 05:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
recovery of of net metering costs can't
 
05:24:46.708 --> 05:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
you do the same thing with your bill
 
05:24:50.510 --> 05:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
today by looking at the default service
 
05:24:52.670 --> 05:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
charge it would be much more difficult
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
to do that today because it would be a
 
05:24:58.510 --> 05:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
much smaller part of the standard
 
05:25:05.310 --> 05:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:05.320 --> 05:25:08.350 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:25:08.350 --> 05:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:12.350 --> 05:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
Reynolds thank you Mr acting chairman um
 
05:25:14.350 --> 05:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
05:25:17.948 --> 05:25:17.958 align:start position:0%
question um just as a way of sort of
 
05:25:21.150 --> 05:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
level level setting
 
05:25:25.948 --> 05:25:25.958 align:start position:0%
for um the discussion that we'll have
 
05:25:28.548 --> 05:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um the language in your bill
 
05:25:29.868 --> 05:25:29.878 align:start position:0%
and the and the first sentence of your
 
05:25:32.750 --> 05:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
testimony goes straight out and and
 
05:25:36.628 --> 05:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
clearly makes a a uh a statement
 
05:25:39.270 --> 05:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
that net metering costs that net
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
metering has imposes costs uh and to
 
05:25:45.548 --> 05:25:45.558 align:start position:0%
ensure that every electric utility
 
05:25:48.430 --> 05:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
customer pays for the costs uh could you
 
05:25:52.628 --> 05:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
just explain for all of us now uh and
 
05:25:56.310 --> 05:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
and everyone watching what are the costs
 
05:25:59.310 --> 05:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
of net metering that you are referring
 
05:26:01.628 --> 05:26:01.638 align:start position:0%
to the costs of net
 
05:26:05.430 --> 05:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
metering well if you read the uh pu
 
05:26:08.708 --> 05:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
order that I I referenced in my in my
 
05:26:11.868 --> 05:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
testimony the costs are e explained
 
05:26:14.390 --> 05:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
exactly how eversource
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
calculates its net metering cost it's
 
05:26:20.670 --> 05:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
basically what they pay to a customer
 
05:26:23.430 --> 05:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
generator for the exported electricity
 
05:26:24.270 --> 05:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
that they
 
05:26:27.948 --> 05:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
buy and they keep track of those costs
 
05:26:31.628 --> 05:26:31.638 align:start position:0%
and then they recover them
 
05:26:33.868 --> 05:26:33.878 align:start position:0%
through a series of mechanisms but
 
05:26:36.510 --> 05:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
primarily through stranded cost recovery
 
05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
there are some other credits that
 
05:26:40.548 --> 05:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
occasionally get applied but mostly it's
 
05:26:42.708 --> 05:26:42.718 align:start position:0%
through stranded cost
 
05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
recovery follow up Mr chairman follow
 
05:26:49.310 --> 05:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
up okay I I will go and and and read
 
05:26:52.788 --> 05:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
that accounting but um could you just
 
05:26:54.270 --> 05:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
for us
 
05:26:58.830 --> 05:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
now when the utility pays a customer
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
generator for their kilowatt hour
 
05:27:03.788 --> 05:27:03.798 align:start position:0%
they're getting a kilowatt hour they're
 
05:27:05.430 --> 05:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're paying for they're
 
05:27:05.440 --> 05:27:07.310 align:start position:0%
they're they're paying for they're
buying

05:27:07.310 --> 05:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
buying
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:16.230 --> 05:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
um it seems that there there's a cost
 
05:27:18.350 --> 05:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
and then there's there's a product in
 
05:27:19.948 --> 05:27:19.958 align:start position:0%
return there's a there's a benefit
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
there's a an asset that gets purchased
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
with that cost so what are the I mean
 
05:27:29.910 --> 05:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
clearly by wanting to recategorize these
 
05:27:33.548 --> 05:27:33.558 align:start position:0%
net reading cost as stranded cost
 
05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
you're contending that it's an excessive
 
05:27:40.590 --> 05:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
cost that's um could you explain a
 
05:27:43.628 --> 05:27:43.638 align:start position:0%
little bit more about why you see it as
 
05:27:46.070 --> 05:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
just a cost that ought to be categorized
 
05:27:49.350 --> 05:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
as a a stranded cost when there's a
 
05:27:49.360 --> 05:27:50.510 align:start position:0%
as a a stranded cost when there's a
resource

05:27:50.510 --> 05:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
resource
 
05:27:54.110 --> 05:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
procured for the cost well I never said
 
05:27:55.788 --> 05:27:55.798 align:start position:0%
it was an excessive
 
05:27:58.510 --> 05:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
cost and I don't believe every Source
 
05:28:01.310 --> 05:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
ever said that either in their
 
05:28:04.230 --> 05:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay um proceeding before the
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
commission but it is a cost for
 
05:28:09.548 --> 05:28:09.558 align:start position:0%
eversource because they have to pay for
 
05:28:12.110 --> 05:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
that electricity normally they pay for
 
05:28:14.670 --> 05:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
electricity by issuing an
 
05:28:16.948 --> 05:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
RFP Contracting with a wholesale
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
supplier to supply electricity and they
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
pay for it as
 
05:28:25.110 --> 05:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
they as they acquire it as they are
 
05:28:28.670 --> 05:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
delivered as it's delivered to them and
 
05:28:31.910 --> 05:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
so similarly when it comes time to
 
05:28:34.190 --> 05:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
taking exported power from a customer
 
05:28:36.030 --> 05:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
generator they have to essentially pay
 
05:28:39.708 --> 05:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
for it and so they record those costs
 
05:28:41.910 --> 05:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
and they recover them through stranded
 
05:28:41.920 --> 05:28:42.830 align:start position:0%
and they recover them through stranded
cost

05:28:42.830 --> 05:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:28:45.510 --> 05:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
recovery that doesn't imply necessarily
 
05:28:47.110 --> 05:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
that those costs were excessive it's
 
05:28:48.708 --> 05:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
just the way they do it it's the way
 
05:28:51.670 --> 05:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
they have asked for permission to do it
 
05:28:53.628 --> 05:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
the other way they could do it is
 
05:28:53.638 --> 05:28:54.830 align:start position:0%
the other way they could do it is
through

05:28:54.830 --> 05:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:28:57.270 --> 05:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
rates just default Service rates they
 
05:29:00.510 --> 05:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
used to do it that way Unitil does it
 
05:29:03.110 --> 05:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
differently they they um have a
 
05:29:05.868 --> 05:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
mechanism they call the external dist
 
05:29:08.948 --> 05:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
distribution charge which is similar
 
05:29:10.510 --> 05:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
it's a non- bypassable charge it's
 
05:29:12.430 --> 05:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
similar to a stranded cost recovery
 
05:29:15.230 --> 05:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
charge but they don't call it that they
 
05:29:16.750 --> 05:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
do have a separate stranded cost
 
05:29:18.990 --> 05:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
recovery charge that they use for other
 
05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
things but they don't put it on the
 
05:29:26.310 --> 05:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
customer bill so in the interest of
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
transparency the amendment I'll submit
 
05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
specifies that that even that external
 
05:29:35.590 --> 05:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
distribution charge if they want to
 
05:29:37.750 --> 05:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
continue to use it should appear on a
 
05:29:37.760 --> 05:29:39.868 align:start position:0%
continue to use it should appear on a
customer

05:29:39.868 --> 05:29:39.878 align:start position:0%
customer
 
05:29:41.910 --> 05:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill have
 
05:29:44.590 --> 05:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
daughter thank you I always need a
 
05:29:46.990 --> 05:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
refresher course in net metering so I
 
05:29:48.190 --> 05:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
was reading this while you were
 
05:29:50.708 --> 05:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
answering him so I may have missed it um
 
05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
the cost of net metering spreads the
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
cost of net metering to all customers
 
05:29:56.510 --> 05:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
not just default services so does that
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
mean people who are part of net metering
 
05:30:00.750 --> 05:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
they're paying a lower cost and to
 
05:30:04.270 --> 05:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
recover the cost the utility will charge
 
05:30:06.868 --> 05:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
everybody else more is that correct so
 
05:30:09.430 --> 05:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're all paying for net metering all
 
05:30:11.390 --> 05:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
even if even those who are not part of
 
05:30:14.430 --> 05:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
net metering is that
 
05:30:16.750 --> 05:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
correct uh I'm not sure I fully
 
05:30:20.310 --> 05:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:23.948 --> 05:30:23.958 align:start position:0%
but but the what it all boils down to is
 
05:30:26.030 --> 05:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
that stranded cost recovery charge is
 
05:30:29.470 --> 05:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
part of the distribution charge on the
 
05:30:32.830 --> 05:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
bill and that's a non- bypassable charge
 
05:30:35.430 --> 05:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
that everybody pays whether you buy your
 
05:30:37.948 --> 05:30:37.958 align:start position:0%
electricity the energy itself from ever
 
05:30:41.310 --> 05:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
Source or not if you get uh the energy
 
05:30:43.590 --> 05:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
distributed over eversource distribution
 
05:30:46.030 --> 05:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
system then you'll pay that charge so
 
05:30:47.548 --> 05:30:47.558 align:start position:0%
even if you're getting your your
 
05:30:49.708 --> 05:30:49.718 align:start position:0%
electricity from an alternative
 
05:30:52.910 --> 05:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
supplier uh you'll still pay the
 
05:30:54.868 --> 05:30:54.878 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery chart so you'll
 
05:30:57.230 --> 05:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
you'll pay the cost of net metering
 
05:30:59.150 --> 05:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
through that stranded cost recovery
 
05:30:59.160 --> 05:31:03.548 align:start position:0%
through that stranded cost recovery
charge

05:31:03.548 --> 05:31:03.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:03.558 --> 05:31:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:31:05.990 --> 05:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:31:09.150 --> 05:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh thank you uh Mr Vice chairman
 
05:31:11.590 --> 05:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
I mean my question is a little bit of a
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know I am kind of new to this so a
 
05:31:18.190 --> 05:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
follow up to my my colleague here which
 
05:31:21.150 --> 05:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
is if you have a person with a a solar
 
05:31:23.270 --> 05:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
panel and they're generating you know a
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
few watts of power and they are allowed
 
05:31:28.628 --> 05:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
to sell that to the utility you know I I
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
think your point was that that that
 
05:31:32.548 --> 05:31:32.558 align:start position:0%
thing has the same value as the money
 
05:31:35.670 --> 05:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
they're paying for it but what I would
 
05:31:38.670 --> 05:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
ask you is is that power of any value to
 
05:31:41.390 --> 05:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
the utility or is it completely
 
05:31:43.750 --> 05:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
useless and you know so they have to pay
 
05:31:46.270 --> 05:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
money out to people who happen to have a
 
05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
solar panel but it all it does is ADD
 
05:31:51.868 --> 05:31:51.878 align:start position:0%
cost to you know the generation of
 
05:31:54.350 --> 05:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
electricity by or
 
05:31:54.360 --> 05:31:57.150 align:start position:0%
electricity by or
or

05:31:57.150 --> 05:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:32:00.310 --> 05:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
the I mean I guess what I'm saying is
 
05:32:02.548 --> 05:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
you know if they if they have a plan for
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
how to how to meet the load on the grid
 
05:32:07.830 --> 05:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
and then one day somebody it's a sunny
 
05:32:09.948 --> 05:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
day they they start sending a few Watts
 
05:32:12.628 --> 05:32:12.638 align:start position:0%
you know to the utility is that take the
 
05:32:14.350 --> 05:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
place of power that they've already
 
05:32:16.628 --> 05:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
bought from you know Quebec hyro or
 
05:32:19.750 --> 05:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
whoever yes um and you know the the
 
05:32:21.548 --> 05:32:21.558 align:start position:0%
followup I have to this and maybe I have
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
this all wrong but a lot of these
 
05:32:25.070 --> 05:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
programs have always seem to me like
 
05:32:26.948 --> 05:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
kind of a wealth transfer it's people
 
05:32:28.750 --> 05:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
who got plenty of money and putting
 
05:32:31.470 --> 05:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
solar panels on their roof uh are being
 
05:32:33.750 --> 05:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
subsidized and that cost is being paid
 
05:32:35.350 --> 05:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
for by you know the guy who works in a
 
05:32:37.590 --> 05:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
grocery store and doesn't have any any
 
05:32:40.948 --> 05:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
solar panels so I don't know am I am I
 
05:32:42.910 --> 05:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
completely off on this or is there
 
05:32:46.548 --> 05:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:50.390 --> 05:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
that there are questions about the value
 
05:32:53.868 --> 05:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
of net metered electricity because of
 
05:32:56.270 --> 05:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
its intermittency and the fact that
 
05:32:58.590 --> 05:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
utilities have to buy Power that's
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
always guaranteed to be there there is a
 
05:33:05.110 --> 05:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
question about whether one is worth more
 
05:33:07.030 --> 05:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
than the other I don't I think that's
 
05:33:09.230 --> 05:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of this discussion so
 
05:33:10.628 --> 05:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should get into that
 
05:33:13.590 --> 05:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
here today but uh it's a question that
 
05:33:16.868 --> 05:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
you might want to do more research
 
05:33:19.150 --> 05:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
on representative
 
05:33:23.230 --> 05:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr acting chairman and
 
05:33:24.670 --> 05:33:24.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
question I actually wanted to just kind
 
05:33:29.350 --> 05:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
of clarify this we're kind of all over
 
05:33:31.350 --> 05:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
the place and how we're approaching what
 
05:33:34.548 --> 05:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
we're looking at in front of us and um I
 
05:33:36.150 --> 05:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
understand your point that you'd like to
 
05:33:38.150 --> 05:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
see greater transparency so you're
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
saying if it gets placed on the bill as
 
05:33:45.150 --> 05:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
part of um the stranded costs then
 
05:33:46.590 --> 05:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
people will be able to go somewhere and
 
05:33:48.628 --> 05:33:48.638 align:start position:0%
figure out what percentage of that comes
 
05:33:52.510 --> 05:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
from net meter charges but as we've been
 
05:33:55.708 --> 05:33:55.718 align:start position:0%
having the conversation we've uh gone
 
05:33:58.390 --> 05:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
back to the fact that it still is a rate
 
05:34:02.110 --> 05:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
recovery mechanism in terms of where it
 
05:34:05.990 --> 05:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
really Falls so my question is around us
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
changing this categorization um and then
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
you clarified and you mentioned that
 
05:34:13.548 --> 05:34:13.558 align:start position:0%
Unitil is has created a new category for
 
05:34:15.910 --> 05:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
this external distrib distribution
 
05:34:17.948 --> 05:34:17.958 align:start position:0%
charge and I think the reason they're
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
trying to distinguish it is that the
 
05:34:23.910 --> 05:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
only way we can actually use distributed
 
05:34:26.430 --> 05:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
energy is by leveraging the distribution
 
05:34:28.190 --> 05:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
system right somebody has to be able to
 
05:34:31.868 --> 05:34:31.878 align:start position:0%
manage it to get it to be useful uh
 
05:34:35.590 --> 05:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
right down the street so um I guess my
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
question is what is the benefit really
 
05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
of turning this into a stranded cost
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
when when I read the the chapter on
 
05:34:46.948 --> 05:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
electric utility restructuring and see
 
05:34:48.548 --> 05:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
what it falls into the category of
 
05:34:48.558 --> 05:34:49.628 align:start position:0%
what it falls into the category of
stranded

05:34:49.628 --> 05:34:49.638 align:start position:0%
stranded
 
05:34:51.670 --> 05:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
costs one of these things is not like
 
05:34:53.910 --> 05:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
the other the the the rate recovery is a
 
05:34:55.510 --> 05:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
is a totally different animal and I just
 
05:34:57.230 --> 05:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
don't understand why it would be in that
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
category I think it's more confusing to
 
05:34:59.520 --> 05:35:00.350 align:start position:0%
category I think it's more confusing to
make

05:35:00.350 --> 05:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:35:02.070 --> 05:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
part of that category rather than have
 
05:35:05.750 --> 05:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
maybe a separate listing for it under um
 
05:35:05.760 --> 05:35:08.830 align:start position:0%
maybe a separate listing for it under um
under

05:35:08.830 --> 05:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:13.548 --> 05:35:13.558 align:start position:0%
rates I would answer that concern by
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
suggesting that uh Mr Lata from
 
05:35:19.270 --> 05:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
eversource will be testifying after me
 
05:35:20.990 --> 05:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay maybe he can you give you a
 
05:35:23.470 --> 05:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
rationale for why eversource pursued
 
05:35:26.270 --> 05:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
this mechanism in the first place they
 
05:35:28.868 --> 05:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
went to the Public Utilities Commission
 
05:35:31.548 --> 05:35:31.558 align:start position:0%
and requested Ed permission to recover
 
05:35:33.390 --> 05:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
these net metering costs through
 
05:35:35.070 --> 05:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
stranded cost
 
05:35:38.390 --> 05:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
recovery and we granted that permission
 
05:35:42.590 --> 05:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
26450 and he might be able to give you a
 
05:35:47.590 --> 05:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
better explanation than I could because
 
05:35:50.110 --> 05:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
I haven't read the full order
 
05:35:53.910 --> 05:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
recently um about exactly why they
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
decided to do it that way but it is a
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
good question okay thank
 
05:35:58.680 --> 05:36:00.948 align:start position:0%
good question okay thank
you

05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:36:04.190 --> 05:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr chair and
 
05:36:06.628 --> 05:36:06.638 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair for taking my
 
05:36:12.430 --> 05:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
question um in the last paragraph of um
 
05:36:12.440 --> 05:36:13.750 align:start position:0%
question um in the last paragraph of um
your

05:36:13.750 --> 05:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:36:16.430 --> 05:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
statement you say that utilities can
 
05:36:18.670 --> 05:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
currently recover net metering costs
 
05:36:20.510 --> 05:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
without a change in
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
law why do we need this law then what
 
05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
does this law do that that is that what
 
05:36:29.788 --> 05:36:29.798 align:start position:0%
does this change this this bill what
 
05:36:31.590 --> 05:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
would this bill
 
05:36:33.910 --> 05:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
change so the
 
05:36:37.510 --> 05:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill as I intend to amend it will
 
05:36:39.350 --> 05:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
require that the utilities recover their
 
05:36:41.628 --> 05:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
net metering costs through stranded cost
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
recovery charges or a similar non-
 
05:36:47.868 --> 05:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
bypassable charge basically the intent
 
05:36:50.270 --> 05:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to get that information
 
05:36:53.350 --> 05:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
on a customer bill so customers if they
 
05:36:53.360 --> 05:36:54.788 align:start position:0%
on a customer bill so customers if they
choose

05:36:54.788 --> 05:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
choose
 
05:36:59.830 --> 05:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
to do so have a mechanism and a way to
 
05:37:01.708 --> 05:37:01.718 align:start position:0%
go and investigate what these charges
 
05:37:01.718 --> 05:37:03.750 align:start position:0%
go and investigate what these charges
are

05:37:03.750 --> 05:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:37:03.760 --> 05:37:05.390 align:start position:0%
are

05:37:05.390 --> 05:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
followup
 
05:37:07.830 --> 05:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
followup but that information is already
 
05:37:11.628 --> 05:37:11.638 align:start position:0%
on the bill so what I I'm I'm I'm sorry
 
05:37:13.190 --> 05:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just struggling with what we're
 
05:37:17.270 --> 05:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
gaining here well it is on the bill for
 
05:37:17.280 --> 05:37:18.948 align:start position:0%
gaining here well it is on the bill for
uh

05:37:18.948 --> 05:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:21.990 --> 05:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
eversource and if you knew what it was
 
05:37:23.910 --> 05:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
called it would be
 
05:37:27.190 --> 05:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
on uh it's not on the bill for Unitil
 
05:37:29.548 --> 05:37:29.558 align:start position:0%
because they're extra or external
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
internal distribution charge as they
 
05:37:33.390 --> 05:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
call it is not listed on the
 
05:37:36.150 --> 05:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
05:37:40.868 --> 05:37:40.878 align:start position:0%
so the intent of my proposed bill is to
 
05:37:43.628 --> 05:37:43.638 align:start position:0%
get that charge listed on the bill
 
05:37:45.548 --> 05:37:45.558 align:start position:0%
regardless of what utility you buy your
 
05:37:47.910 --> 05:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
electricity from it's there now from
 
05:37:49.948 --> 05:37:49.958 align:start position:0%
every Source but it's not there from the
 
05:37:51.110 --> 05:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
other two
 
05:37:54.110 --> 05:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
utilities so Mr chairman sorry I know
 
05:37:56.110 --> 05:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
you can I have one more follow you've
 
05:37:57.868 --> 05:37:57.878 align:start position:0%
had your two wait till everyone else has
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
their turn then we'll come back
 
05:38:03.990 --> 05:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:38:06.708 --> 05:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
PL uh thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:38:08.670 --> 05:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
questions us uh because my lack of
 
05:38:12.070 --> 05:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
recall I hope you can answer this um
 
05:38:15.230 --> 05:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
States regul uh regulated utilities does
 
05:38:18.070 --> 05:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
that include uh the co-op New Hampshire
 
05:38:22.230 --> 05:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:24.910 --> 05:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
you represent MC
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
Williams thank you chair Thomas um uh
 
05:38:29.948 --> 05:38:29.958 align:start position:0%
chair Vose my question question is
 
05:38:32.310 --> 05:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
related to the uh renewable portfolio
 
05:38:33.708 --> 05:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
standard and renewable energy
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
certificates requirements that our
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
utilities need to meet in terms of
 
05:38:39.548 --> 05:38:39.558 align:start position:0%
percentages um it looks to me like some
 
05:38:41.230 --> 05:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
of this net metering is being used to
 
05:38:43.270 --> 05:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
meet those requirements and so I would
 
05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
say that the value that the utilities
 
05:38:48.310 --> 05:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
are paying are in order to meet
 
05:38:49.788 --> 05:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
something that they are statutorily
 
05:38:52.548 --> 05:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
required to do and therefore I don't
 
05:38:54.548 --> 05:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
think there should be a stranded cost
 
05:38:57.230 --> 05:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
because they have to do
 
05:39:01.310 --> 05:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
it comments well the Pu says that it's
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
perfectly acceptable to recover net
 
05:39:05.788 --> 05:39:05.798 align:start position:0%
metering costs via stranded cost
 
05:39:05.798 --> 05:39:06.910 align:start position:0%
metering costs via stranded cost
recovery

05:39:06.910 --> 05:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
05:39:10.510 --> 05:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
charge followup followup but it looks
 
05:39:12.310 --> 05:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
like a double dip just in terms of the
 
05:39:14.788 --> 05:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement because they have
 
05:39:18.270 --> 05:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
to in order to meet the the renewable uh
 
05:39:21.430 --> 05:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard so I can see the Pu
 
05:39:23.070 --> 05:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
maybe not taking that into consideration
 
05:39:24.990 --> 05:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
at the time that they made the ruling
 
05:39:26.628 --> 05:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the new statute that
 
05:39:28.590 --> 05:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking to pass we're still going
 
05:39:29.830 --> 05:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
to be in conflict with with something
 
05:39:33.548 --> 05:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:36.430 --> 05:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
books I don't fully understand what
 
05:39:38.750 --> 05:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get at there the the
 
05:39:41.190 --> 05:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
RPS and net metering are completely
 
05:39:44.788 --> 05:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
different programs so I'm not
 
05:39:46.468 --> 05:39:46.478 align:start position:0%
sure why
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:54.230 --> 05:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
explanation maybe we could talk about it
 
05:39:57.030 --> 05:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
offline uh sure we could discuss this
 
05:40:00.030 --> 05:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
offline I there's still a cost but
 
05:40:05.628 --> 05:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:09.948 --> 05:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:12.430 --> 05:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
05:40:15.430 --> 05:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for taking my question
 
05:40:17.270 --> 05:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'm still trying to wrap my head around
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:40:22.150 --> 05:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
transparency notion here uh it's uh an
 
05:40:25.670 --> 05:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
amount that at this point you're we
 
05:40:28.030 --> 05:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
think is a cost there's also an open
 
05:40:30.590 --> 05:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
docket at the Pu about net metering
 
05:40:32.190 --> 05:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
tariffs and those may
 
05:40:34.830 --> 05:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
change but it gets rolled into this
 
05:40:36.708 --> 05:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
stranded cost
 
05:40:38.708 --> 05:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
number the
 
05:40:41.390 --> 05:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
average customer of utility is going to
 
05:40:44.230 --> 05:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
just see this number and yes they could
 
05:40:46.750 --> 05:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
contact the utility and find out about
 
05:40:49.548 --> 05:40:49.558 align:start position:0%
it do you really expect many people to
 
05:40:52.670 --> 05:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
be doing that and really be aware that
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
net metering costs are somehow being
 
05:40:58.150 --> 05:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
rolled into this and that they would
 
05:41:00.390 --> 05:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
then actually
 
05:41:03.548 --> 05:41:03.558 align:start position:0%
take the initiative to go and contact
 
05:41:07.030 --> 05:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
the big utility and try to get this
 
05:41:11.708 --> 05:41:11.718 align:start position:0%
answer probably not however if we set
 
05:41:15.070 --> 05:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
this system up so that all
 
05:41:18.270 --> 05:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
utilities do track net metering costs
 
05:41:18.280 --> 05:41:19.110 align:start position:0%
utilities do track net metering costs
this

05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:41:22.868 --> 05:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
way then that would make it easier and
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
possible in the future to break out
 
05:41:29.750 --> 05:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
those costs and put them on the bill
 
05:41:34.350 --> 05:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
if it appeared to be worthwhile to do
 
05:41:37.350 --> 05:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
that if if you're not tracking them
 
05:41:37.360 --> 05:41:39.150 align:start position:0%
that if if you're not tracking them
effectively

05:41:39.150 --> 05:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
05:41:42.230 --> 05:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
then it's harder to make it transparent
 
05:41:44.510 --> 05:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
what people are paying
 
05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
for follow thank you um and if it were
 
05:41:52.628 --> 05:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
to turn out that net metering actually
 
05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
was not a a cost that shifted because of
 
05:41:58.190 --> 05:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
the benefits of net metering then should
 
05:42:00.150 --> 05:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
the bill reflect the actual benefits of
 
05:42:05.310 --> 05:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:09.110 --> 05:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
everybody well I don't think the issue
 
05:42:12.788 --> 05:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
here is whether net metering costs are
 
05:42:17.230 --> 05:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
shifted it's that net metering costs
 
05:42:17.240 --> 05:42:19.070 align:start position:0%
shifted it's that net metering costs
should

05:42:19.070 --> 05:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
should
 
05:42:22.910 --> 05:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
be paid for by everyone as a non-
 
05:42:22.920 --> 05:42:24.510 align:start position:0%
be paid for by everyone as a non-
bypassable

05:42:24.510 --> 05:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
bypassable
 
05:42:27.150 --> 05:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
charge so it's not a matter of Shifting
 
05:42:29.430 --> 05:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
the costs I can't look at you and
 
05:42:31.110 --> 05:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
speaking to the mic at the same time
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I I
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
know it's not a matter of of costs being
 
05:42:39.948 --> 05:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
shifted it's just being it's just a
 
05:42:42.150 --> 05:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
matter of costs
 
05:42:44.910 --> 05:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
being accounted
 
05:42:48.110 --> 05:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
for that mean a utility could do the
 
05:42:50.510 --> 05:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
same thing for let's say
 
05:42:54.750 --> 05:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
trucks it could track the costs of
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
trucks and recover those costs in a
 
05:43:00.990 --> 05:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
separate charge rather than in
 
05:43:04.910 --> 05:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
rates it would be fundamentally the same
 
05:43:07.110 --> 05:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
issue same
 
05:43:09.948 --> 05:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
question uh so it's it's just a matter
 
05:43:12.030 --> 05:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
of how they go about recovering the
 
05:43:12.040 --> 05:43:13.830 align:start position:0%
of how they go about recovering the
costs

05:43:13.830 --> 05:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
costs
 
05:43:18.788 --> 05:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:20.910 --> 05:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
do now would be a good time
 
05:43:20.920 --> 05:43:22.110 align:start position:0%
do now would be a good time
representative

05:43:22.110 --> 05:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:43:25.150 --> 05:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
Ms thank thank you and please please
 
05:43:28.468 --> 05:43:28.478 align:start position:0%
bear with me um so if if I understand
 
05:43:28.478 --> 05:43:30.310 align:start position:0%
bear with me um so if if I understand
correctly

05:43:30.310 --> 05:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
05:43:36.430 --> 05:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
um what you're proposing is that um the
 
05:43:38.910 --> 05:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
methodology that ever source is
 
05:43:42.310 --> 05:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
using be applied to all of the
 
05:43:44.628 --> 05:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
utilities so that so that we're
 
05:43:46.910 --> 05:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
consistent across all
 
05:43:50.750 --> 05:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
utilities um and you're not proposing
 
05:43:54.110 --> 05:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
any call it policy change in terms of
 
05:43:57.270 --> 05:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
how we treat or view net metering costs
 
05:43:59.830 --> 05:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's just purely how we report rep those
 
05:44:05.670 --> 05:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:10.070 --> 05:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
you represent Thomas Wendy Thomas well I
 
05:44:11.390 --> 05:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the habit of calling on
 
05:44:13.548 --> 05:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
myself so oh okay all right well thank
 
05:44:17.868 --> 05:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you um Mr acting chair um I
 
05:44:19.830 --> 05:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
think it's been mentioned in in a
 
05:44:22.190 --> 05:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
previous discussion most people don't
 
05:44:25.310 --> 05:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
know what the heck net net metering is
 
05:44:27.788 --> 05:44:27.798 align:start position:0%
and so if you're uh proposing to put a
 
05:44:31.230 --> 05:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
net metering charge on a bill will it
 
05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
all will the bill also include a
 
05:44:35.708 --> 05:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
definition of what net metering is along
 
05:44:38.350 --> 05:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
with the benefits of it well I suggested
 
05:44:39.830 --> 05:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
that that's something that could be done
 
05:44:41.430 --> 05:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
in the future but I'm not suggesting
 
05:44:46.350 --> 05:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:49.468 --> 05:44:49.478 align:start position:0%
now seeing no further questions uh thank
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
you representative o for your
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
testimony and moving right along I'm
 
05:44:56.708 --> 05:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
going to call upon
 
05:45:00.948 --> 05:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
Mr Griffin robers no stranger to our
 
05:45:03.190 --> 05:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee representing Department of
 
05:45:05.548 --> 05:45:05.558 align:start position:0%
Defense of uh
 
05:45:27.868 --> 05:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:27.878 --> 05:45:29.548 align:start position:0%
 
fence

05:45:29.548 --> 05:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
fence
 
05:45:30.990 --> 05:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:45:32.750 --> 05:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh again for the record
 
05:45:35.110 --> 05:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
Griffin Roberge uh State energy program
 
05:45:36.628 --> 05:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
manager at the New Hampshire Department
 
05:45:39.990 --> 05:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
of energy um going around the room right
 
05:45:42.788 --> 05:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
now or making its way um is a letter of
 
05:45:45.310 --> 05:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Department um the
 
05:45:47.948 --> 05:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on the bill as
 
05:45:51.070 --> 05:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
introduced um as has been discussed um
 
05:45:54.190 --> 05:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1398 requires the cost of net
 
05:45:56.548 --> 05:45:56.558 align:start position:0%
energy metering uh to be assessed under
 
05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
a stranded cost recovery mechanism
 
05:46:02.548 --> 05:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
um by new by New Hampshire's Electric
 
05:46:06.110 --> 05:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
utilities um for context and it's been
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier uh the cost of all net
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
metering payments to customers who
 
05:46:13.708 --> 05:46:13.718 align:start position:0%
export energy to the distribution grid
 
05:46:16.430 --> 05:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
and payments made to group host um net
 
05:46:18.548 --> 05:46:18.558 align:start position:0%
metering host uh group net metering
 
05:46:21.670 --> 05:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
hosts um are already included in non-
 
05:46:23.788 --> 05:46:23.798 align:start position:0%
bypassable rate components such as
 
05:46:27.030 --> 05:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
stranded cost charges paid for by all
 
05:46:30.150 --> 05:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
customers um these net metering costs uh
 
05:46:31.868 --> 05:46:31.878 align:start position:0%
have been included in rate elements that
 
05:46:34.110 --> 05:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
all customers must pay so that there's
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
no avoiding those costs whether or not
 
05:46:40.510 --> 05:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh if you go to uh competitive Supply or
 
05:46:42.430 --> 05:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise all of New Hampshire's
 
05:46:45.070 --> 05:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
Electric utilities have or are currently
 
05:46:47.030 --> 05:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
undergoing adjudicative proceedings at
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
the Pu to establish rate mechanisms um
 
05:46:51.708 --> 05:46:51.718 align:start position:0%
that include the costs associated with
 
05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
net metering um for example eversource
 
05:46:56.510 --> 05:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
currently has one under
 
05:47:00.070 --> 05:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
de23 091 that's an annual review of
 
05:47:01.990 --> 05:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
their stranded costs um that is
 
05:47:04.708 --> 05:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
currently in process um as again has
 
05:47:06.310 --> 05:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
been mentioned eversource uses a
 
05:47:08.430 --> 05:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery charge on each
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
customer's Bill and that cost includes
 
05:47:13.708 --> 05:47:13.718 align:start position:0%
not just net metering cost but also uh
 
05:47:15.868 --> 05:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
costs related to the divesture of
 
05:47:19.830 --> 05:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
generation assets it held um in 2018 um
 
05:47:21.510 --> 05:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
as well as other Reggie cost
 
05:47:23.468 --> 05:47:23.478 align:start position:0%
environmental remediation costs related
 
05:47:27.310 --> 05:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
to former manufactured gas plants um Etc
 
05:47:29.230 --> 05:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
um unitel currently has has a docket
 
05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
underway and again that's
 
05:47:31.440 --> 05:47:33.390 align:start position:0%
underway and again that's
de

05:47:33.390 --> 05:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
de
 
05:47:36.030 --> 05:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
23057 that's an annual review of unit
 
05:47:38.150 --> 05:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
tell's external delivery charge which
 
05:47:39.788 --> 05:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
again is another version of a non-
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
bypassable charge that's comprised of
 
05:47:44.230 --> 05:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
reggi rebates transmission charges net
 
05:47:47.670 --> 05:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
metering costs and other costs as well
 
05:47:50.030 --> 05:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
finally uh Liberty Utilities currently
 
05:47:52.510 --> 05:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
has an active ongoing distribution rate
 
05:47:55.830 --> 05:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
case under de
 
05:47:58.230 --> 05:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
2339 um where the company proposed the
 
05:48:00.390 --> 05:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
creation of a non- bypassable rate
 
05:48:02.990 --> 05:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism called the electric
 
05:48:06.070 --> 05:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
reconciliation adjustment mechanism or
 
05:48:09.590 --> 05:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
eam um this uh non- bypassable rate
 
05:48:11.670 --> 05:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
mechanism would bring together a number
 
05:48:13.270 --> 05:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
of various costs that are currently
 
05:48:15.468 --> 05:48:15.478 align:start position:0%
collected elsewhere and places them all
 
05:48:17.070 --> 05:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
under the umbrella of One non-
 
05:48:19.750 --> 05:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
bypassable Rate mechanism um this
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
proposal would include net metering
 
05:48:24.390 --> 05:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
costs and in that ongoing docket the
 
05:48:25.910 --> 05:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
department is supportive of that
 
05:48:28.628 --> 05:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
proposal and if approved by the Pu this
 
05:48:31.310 --> 05:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism would likely be included um or
 
05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
I should say this ratee mechanism will
 
05:48:34.670 --> 05:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
be similar to those that are done by
 
05:48:36.750 --> 05:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
eversource and
 
05:48:41.150 --> 05:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
unitel um should HB 1398 as introduced
 
05:48:42.990 --> 05:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
proceed in its current form and I
 
05:48:44.868 --> 05:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
understand representative Vose um
 
05:48:46.468 --> 05:48:46.478 align:start position:0%
indicated he might have an amendment
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um the committee might want to
 
05:48:51.150 --> 05:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
consider amending the effective date of
 
05:48:54.230 --> 05:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
the bill um requiring all New Hampshire
 
05:48:56.350 --> 05:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
Electric uh distribution utilities to
 
05:48:59.150 --> 05:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
meet this language within 60 days would
 
05:49:01.230 --> 05:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
likely not be possible for the one
 
05:49:03.230 --> 05:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
remaining utility um that this bill
 
05:49:04.990 --> 05:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
would likely impact which is Liberty
 
05:49:06.788 --> 05:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
because they are currently undergoing a
 
05:49:08.910 --> 05:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory process on that non-
 
05:49:11.510 --> 05:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
bypassable rate right now um
 
05:49:13.110 --> 05:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
Additionally the bills focused to have
 
05:49:15.548 --> 05:49:15.558 align:start position:0%
net metering costs assessed under a
 
05:49:18.190 --> 05:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery mechanism may be
 
05:49:20.070 --> 05:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
too specific as it could create
 
05:49:21.990 --> 05:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
additional administrative and Regulatory
 
05:49:24.150 --> 05:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
burdens to move these costs from where
 
05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
they currently are as the Pu approved
 
05:49:29.150 --> 05:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
them to meet the uh statute language
 
05:49:31.788 --> 05:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
provided under this bill um obviously
 
05:49:33.030 --> 05:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
the department is always willing to
 
05:49:35.788 --> 05:49:35.798 align:start position:0%
provide technical feedback on uh
 
05:49:38.070 --> 05:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
amendments bills what have you and uh
 
05:49:39.430 --> 05:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
that position is not changing here I'm
 
05:49:40.948 --> 05:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
more than willing to talk about any
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment um and with that I'll
 
05:49:46.190 --> 05:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
close my
 
05:49:49.468 --> 05:49:49.478 align:start position:0%
testimony represent of Kaplan thank you
 
05:49:52.468 --> 05:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair and thank you Mr Roar um
 
05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about these uh these what do
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
you call them these new rate cases that
 
05:49:59.868 --> 05:49:59.878 align:start position:0%
the you ities are bringing to to recover
 
05:50:03.190 --> 05:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
their Cost U stranded C stranded cost in
 
05:50:05.310 --> 05:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
other words sure
 
05:50:09.110 --> 05:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
um could you provide information as to
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
what costs they are considering when
 
05:50:14.110 --> 05:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
they call for these uh cost you know
 
05:50:16.310 --> 05:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
these net meter cost to be what what
 
05:50:18.430 --> 05:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
what could you itemize those costs for
 
05:50:20.468 --> 05:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
us so thank you for the question so by
 
05:50:23.590 --> 05:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
and large um the costs for net metering
 
05:50:25.510 --> 05:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
that are recovered under these non-
 
05:50:27.788 --> 05:50:27.798 align:start position:0%
bypassable rate mechanisms are those
 
05:50:29.910 --> 05:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
costs that are paid to customers who
 
05:50:32.150 --> 05:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
export power to the grid from their
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
systems um obviously that number e that
 
05:50:37.990 --> 05:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
number es and flows every year oh sorry
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
just clarification so the they're
 
05:50:41.990 --> 05:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're charging the
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
cost the cost that they are charging
 
05:50:46.510 --> 05:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
equals the amount that they are paying
 
05:50:49.708 --> 05:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
to the customer generators yes okay yes
 
05:50:52.150 --> 05:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying trying to remember where I
 
05:50:58.468 --> 05:50:58.478 align:start position:0%
picked off so the cost of paying those
 
05:51:01.270 --> 05:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
customers who export energy back to the
 
05:51:04.590 --> 05:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
grid that es and flows over time because
 
05:51:07.270 --> 05:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
the default service rate changes so um
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
if rates go down net metering costs
 
05:51:11.910 --> 05:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
likely go down um if energy costs go up
 
05:51:14.350 --> 05:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
net metering costs likely go up as well
 
05:51:17.390 --> 05:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
um each of the utilities through various
 
05:51:19.590 --> 05:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceedings at the Pu I
 
05:51:21.430 --> 05:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
know a lot has been discussed here about
 
05:51:24.750 --> 05:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
emulating ever sources style um in a pu
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
proceeding unitel and Liberty have
 
05:51:29.310 --> 05:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
different non bypassable rate mechanisms
 
05:51:31.350 --> 05:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
that have been approved by the Pu
 
05:51:33.670 --> 05:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
they're not just a stand stranded cost
 
05:51:35.230 --> 05:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
recovery charge like ever Source they're
 
05:51:36.548 --> 05:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
called different things but they're all
 
05:51:38.750 --> 05:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
essentially a non- bypassable rate
 
05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
mechanism everybody pays them nobody can
 
05:51:45.468 --> 05:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
avoid them so they get they get the theg
 
05:51:48.468 --> 05:51:48.478 align:start position:0%
followup one follow up yeah so so the
 
05:51:50.868 --> 05:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
utilities are receiving that energy that
 
05:51:52.110 --> 05:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
they've paid for and they're also
 
05:51:53.910 --> 05:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
getting the money back that they pay
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
correct okay sounds like a good
 
05:51:57.280 --> 05:51:59.150 align:start position:0%
correct okay sounds like a good
deal

05:51:59.150 --> 05:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
deal
 
05:52:01.628 --> 05:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
re sentive L wikii okay thank you Mr
 
05:52:05.270 --> 05:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you Mr Rob um I'm
 
05:52:08.948 --> 05:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
somewhat new to this now and uh we are
 
05:52:10.270 --> 05:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
talking about various things I just
 
05:52:12.590 --> 05:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
looked at ISO New England site and they
 
05:52:14.590 --> 05:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
say that their wholeale the price for
 
05:52:16.750 --> 05:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now is 8 cents a kilowatt
 
05:52:19.628 --> 05:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
hour how does that compare with the
 
05:52:21.590 --> 05:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
default rate and is the default rate the
 
05:52:23.910 --> 05:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
same as the net metering rate thank you
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
for the question um yes uh let me flip
 
05:52:30.110 --> 05:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
over here
 
05:52:31.708 --> 05:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
forgive me there are a number of
 
05:52:33.750 --> 05:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
different uh I should say there's net
 
05:52:37.390 --> 05:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
Maring tariff 1.0 net metering tariff
 
05:52:40.670 --> 05:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
2.0 so there's different tariffs that
 
05:52:42.750 --> 05:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
apply to different customers you know
 
05:52:43.948 --> 05:52:43.958 align:start position:0%
based on the time that they
 
05:52:43.958 --> 05:52:45.510 align:start position:0%
based on the time that they
interconnected

05:52:45.510 --> 05:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
interconnected
 
05:52:48.350 --> 05:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
so their compensation might be different
 
05:52:50.990 --> 05:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
depending on what tariff they fall under
 
05:52:53.150 --> 05:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
um but circling back to what I mentioned
 
05:52:55.030 --> 05:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
to representative kaplan's question you
 
05:52:58.270 --> 05:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
know I know the energy rates have been
 
05:53:01.190 --> 05:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
were up due to the Ukrainian um crisis
 
05:53:03.750 --> 05:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the inflationary pressures um those
 
05:53:06.230 --> 05:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
costs are coming down um so therefore
 
05:53:08.468 --> 05:53:08.478 align:start position:0%
the costs that would be assessed for net
 
05:53:11.230 --> 05:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
metering under these uh rate mechanisms
 
05:53:14.190 --> 05:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
would likely be lower as well hope I
 
05:53:15.590 --> 05:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
think that maybe answered your question
 
05:53:17.110 --> 05:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
05:53:20.230 --> 05:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
sure okay we can talk more offline
 
05:53:20.240 --> 05:53:22.548 align:start position:0%
sure okay we can talk more offline
representative

05:53:22.548 --> 05:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:53:25.670 --> 05:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr Vice chairman uh and
 
05:53:27.310 --> 05:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Griffin always good to see
 
05:53:32.350 --> 05:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
you um Mr Rober you're good
 
05:53:36.750 --> 05:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm a little confused by this
 
05:53:40.230 --> 05:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh the sentence uh additionally HB 1398
 
05:53:42.270 --> 05:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
is focused to have net metering costs
 
05:53:44.590 --> 05:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
assessed under a stranded cost recovery
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism may be too specific as it
 
05:53:49.830 --> 05:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
could create additional administrative
 
05:53:52.350 --> 05:53:52.360 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory burdens to move these
 
05:53:54.390 --> 05:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
costs from their current rate mechanisms
 
05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
to meet the Bill's specific
 
05:53:59.868 --> 05:53:59.878 align:start position:0%
requirements can you elaborate on that
 
05:54:02.110 --> 05:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
please sure so I think I'd offer two
 
05:54:04.788 --> 05:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
points is that again eversource being
 
05:54:09.468 --> 05:54:09.478 align:start position:0%
one the largest utility in the state
 
05:54:12.270 --> 05:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
has has stranded costs and Stranded
 
05:54:14.590 --> 05:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
costs are those Investments that at the
 
05:54:16.670 --> 05:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
time were used and useful for the
 
05:54:20.430 --> 05:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
delivery of electricity before you know
 
05:54:21.948 --> 05:54:21.958 align:start position:0%
they have been in the process of selling
 
05:54:24.510 --> 05:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
off of their electric plants they are
 
05:54:26.910 --> 05:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
still recovering uh stranded costs from
 
05:54:30.868 --> 05:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
those Investments at that time um
 
05:54:31.990 --> 05:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
Liberty and
 
05:54:34.190 --> 05:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
unitel just by the basis of what a
 
05:54:36.670 --> 05:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
stranded cost is recovering cost that in
 
05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
the past used to be used and useful for
 
05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
the provision of electricity don't have
 
05:54:42.830 --> 05:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
stranded costs um so I think the
 
05:54:44.948 --> 05:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
department wants to highlight is that
 
05:54:47.750 --> 05:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
you call it a stranded cost but it's not
 
05:54:50.150 --> 05:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
really a stranded cost that's one and
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
then two um administrative and
 
05:54:55.310 --> 05:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
Regulatory burdens there a docket
 
05:54:57.750 --> 05:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
already currently underway um across
 
05:55:00.390 --> 05:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
these different
 
05:55:04.310 --> 05:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
um uh uh adjudicative proceedings um
 
05:55:07.350 --> 05:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
which have been soliciting testimony and
 
05:55:10.110 --> 05:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh ongoing proceedings um this bill
 
05:55:12.110 --> 05:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
might inadvertently throw a wrench into
 
05:55:14.030 --> 05:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
those proceedings and just say
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
legislature says you have to shift it to
 
05:55:17.708 --> 05:55:17.718 align:start position:0%
this rate this rate recovery mechanism
 
05:55:17.718 --> 05:55:19.910 align:start position:0%
this rate this rate recovery mechanism
do

05:55:19.910 --> 05:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:55:19.920 --> 05:55:22.390 align:start position:0%
do
this

05:55:22.390 --> 05:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:55:22.400 --> 05:55:24.030 align:start position:0%
this
followup

05:55:24.030 --> 05:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
followup
 
05:55:26.430 --> 05:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
So based on what you've just told me I'm
 
05:55:28.070 --> 05:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
surprised that the department is new
 
05:55:31.350 --> 05:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
neutral given that you're you're telling
 
05:55:33.070 --> 05:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
me that it's probably not appropriate as
 
05:55:36.070 --> 05:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
a stranded cost and it would throw
 
05:55:39.590 --> 05:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
wrench into open dockets sure and I
 
05:55:41.150 --> 05:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that is why I
 
05:55:43.350 --> 05:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
am here today to testify to that fact
 
05:55:45.510 --> 05:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
but obviously you know and I've heard it
 
05:55:46.910 --> 05:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier that this is an effort
 
05:55:48.670 --> 05:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
to bring transparency onto customers
 
05:55:51.430 --> 05:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
bills this is a policy call for the
 
05:55:53.270 --> 05:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
legislature to make if they think that
 
05:55:57.030 --> 05:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
this is a um a prudent decision to make
 
05:55:59.708 --> 05:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
certainly you're you're free to do so we
 
05:56:01.868 --> 05:56:01.878 align:start position:0%
just make you aware of what the impacts
 
05:56:05.190 --> 05:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:05.200 --> 05:56:06.868 align:start position:0%
 
bad

05:56:06.868 --> 05:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
bad
 
05:56:06.878 --> 05:56:08.990 align:start position:0%
bad
representative

05:56:08.990 --> 05:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:56:11.430 --> 05:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr Vice chair I was
 
05:56:15.030 --> 05:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
looking at you sorry I'm trying to I'm
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
trying to follow the ping pong that
 
05:56:19.310 --> 05:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
that's happening here
 
05:56:22.670 --> 05:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
so so we've already established that the
 
05:56:26.750 --> 05:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
cost if it becomes rolled into stranded
 
05:56:28.750 --> 05:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
costs is not going going to appear on
 
05:56:31.110 --> 05:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
the bill right it will be part of a
 
05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
charge that does not call out any
 
05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
specific in other words the transparency
 
05:56:38.230 --> 05:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
issue that you're saying you're here to
 
05:56:40.030 --> 05:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
support us because the chairman said
 
05:56:42.788 --> 05:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
it's based on transparency can you speak
 
05:56:47.190 --> 05:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
to whether this bill as written uh if
 
05:56:48.830 --> 05:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen the amendment yet and I
 
05:56:51.230 --> 05:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
haven't um would lend itself to
 
05:56:53.430 --> 05:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
transparency because that's what I don't
 
05:56:55.868 --> 05:56:55.878 align:start position:0%
understand I don't I don't see I don't
 
05:56:57.230 --> 05:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
see the argument that the bill is
 
05:56:58.868 --> 05:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
actually Lending any transparency for
 
05:57:00.510 --> 05:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
the consumer sure and that's already
 
05:57:02.190 --> 05:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
been brought up actually no and I thank
 
05:57:05.350 --> 05:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question so I mean
 
05:57:07.948 --> 05:57:07.958 align:start position:0%
it is a it is a matter for this
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee to consider you know ever
 
05:57:12.110 --> 05:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
Source stranded cost recovery charge
 
05:57:14.350 --> 05:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
which is displayed on a customer's bill
 
05:57:16.270 --> 05:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
is not itemized to include all the
 
05:57:18.750 --> 05:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
various costs that are C that are
 
05:57:20.310 --> 05:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
recovered under the stranded cost
 
05:57:22.948 --> 05:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
recovery charge um it's not just net
 
05:57:25.830 --> 05:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
metering it's a bunch of other costs as
 
05:57:29.910 --> 05:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
well um I can cannot comment on unitel I
 
05:57:31.830 --> 05:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't remember off the top of my head if
 
05:57:33.590 --> 05:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
they display the external delivery
 
05:57:35.948 --> 05:57:35.958 align:start position:0%
charge on their bill but much to the
 
05:57:39.548 --> 05:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
same point that charge okay representar
 
05:57:41.150 --> 05:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
shaking his tail I'll take him his word
 
05:57:44.830 --> 05:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
um so um not sure probably not displayed
 
05:57:46.628 --> 05:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
on a customer's bill but that cost does
 
05:57:48.948 --> 05:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
not just include net metering costs that
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
unel is recovering Liberty Utilities is
 
05:57:53.910 --> 05:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
currently undergoing a rate uh rate case
 
05:57:57.070 --> 05:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
now so depending on what the outcome of
 
05:57:59.468 --> 05:57:59.478 align:start position:0%
that rate case is I'm I wouldn't be
 
05:58:00.910 --> 05:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
surprised if right now Liberty doesn't
 
05:58:04.230 --> 05:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
have anything either follow up and
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully this will be a little more
 
05:58:06.670 --> 05:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
pointed since we've been over that
 
05:58:10.990 --> 05:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
already um you did mention that because
 
05:58:15.030 --> 05:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
um eversource moving from PSNH had a
 
05:58:17.468 --> 05:58:17.478 align:start position:0%
different set of stranded recovery costs
 
05:58:19.590 --> 05:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
which is really what the statute lists
 
05:58:22.510 --> 05:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
here they list eversource's stranded
 
05:58:25.270 --> 05:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
examples of stranded costs yep um and it
 
05:58:26.830 --> 05:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with rates which is
 
05:58:28.628 --> 05:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
why I was confused
 
05:58:30.150 --> 05:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
because it seems like rates are
 
05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriately put in there but you're
 
05:58:35.230 --> 05:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
saying all the utilities now are using
 
05:58:37.868 --> 05:58:37.878 align:start position:0%
stranded costs to cover various things
 
05:58:39.910 --> 05:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
that do not include the same categories
 
05:58:41.548 --> 05:58:41.558 align:start position:0%
of things that are in the statutory
 
05:58:42.990 --> 05:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
language that we have is that is that
 
05:58:47.190 --> 05:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
correct thank you let me clarify um each
 
05:58:48.628 --> 05:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
of the utilities has their own
 
05:58:51.230 --> 05:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
respective non bypassable rate mechanism
 
05:58:54.548 --> 05:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
to capture these costs for eversource
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
they have a number of stranded costs
 
05:58:58.070 --> 05:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
left to recover theirs is the recovered
 
05:59:00.510 --> 05:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
under a stranded cost recovery mechanism
 
05:59:02.310 --> 05:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
unitel and Liberty to the best of my
 
05:59:03.510 --> 05:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge and talking with folks from
 
05:59:05.270 --> 05:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
our regulatory Support Division do not
 
05:59:06.948 --> 05:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
have stranded costs they're not
 
05:59:08.910 --> 05:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
recovering they're not continuing to
 
05:59:10.510 --> 05:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
divest themselves of Investments that
 
05:59:11.910 --> 05:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
they made when so you were referring to
 
05:59:14.150 --> 05:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
non bypassable charges which they all
 
05:59:17.270 --> 05:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
have but you weren't saying that the
 
05:59:18.990 --> 05:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
this is just clarification you weren't
 
05:59:21.030 --> 05:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
saying that the information that is
 
05:59:24.510 --> 05:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
currently in statute for stranded costs
 
05:59:26.868 --> 05:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
applied to all this is basically as a
 
05:59:29.310 --> 05:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
result of the restruct structuring P
 
05:59:31.030 --> 05:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's mostly case that's correct yes
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:37.230 --> 05:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:59:40.468 --> 05:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr Vice chair so Mr
 
05:59:43.708 --> 05:59:43.718 align:start position:0%
Rober by putting the all net metering
 
05:59:46.110 --> 05:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
charges from whatever utility in a
 
05:59:49.910 --> 05:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
stranded cost line we are consolidating
 
05:59:52.750 --> 05:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
that information for transparency
 
05:59:56.030 --> 05:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
purposes so if anybody wants to go
 
05:59:58.788 --> 05:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
looking for what those costs are they're
 
06:00:01.948 --> 06:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
already aggregated by each utility they
 
06:00:03.670 --> 06:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
don't go have they don't have to go
 
06:00:06.468 --> 06:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
looking for them or figure them out from
 
06:00:09.030 --> 06:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
whatever track they use they're in one
 
06:00:11.910 --> 06:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
spot it can easily be identified that's
 
06:00:13.430 --> 06:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
the transparency issue that we're
 
06:00:15.430 --> 06:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
talking about is that correct that's
 
06:00:16.628 --> 06:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
what I believe the discussion to be
 
06:00:19.910 --> 06:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:22.948 --> 06:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
yep representative
 
06:00:25.590 --> 06:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
Ms thank you Mr chair and I want to
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
assure my colleagues that I did not say
 
06:00:29.708 --> 06:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
say anything to the people on this
 
06:00:33.948 --> 06:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
side they left of their own valtion um
 
06:00:37.270 --> 06:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Ro um for coming in and
 
06:00:40.590 --> 06:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
talking and speaking with us
 
06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
um so you I think you heard some of my
 
06:00:46.230 --> 06:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
struggles in the in the questioning I
 
06:00:50.670 --> 06:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
had of of uh chairman Vose um and and I
 
06:00:53.270 --> 06:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
guess I want to ask you similar
 
06:00:56.350 --> 06:00:56.360 align:start position:0%
question this bill doesn't change
 
06:00:58.390 --> 06:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
anything that's already being done is
 
06:00:58.400 --> 06:00:59.868 align:start position:0%
anything that's already being done is
that

06:00:59.868 --> 06:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:01:02.390 --> 06:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
correct as introduced that is how the
 
06:01:04.230 --> 06:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
department reads it that's correct the
 
06:01:07.510 --> 06:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
only thing that the bill would do to use
 
06:01:08.948 --> 06:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
what you had asked earlier it would
 
06:01:11.310 --> 06:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
emulate eversource's style and apply it
 
06:01:12.670 --> 06:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
to all
 
06:01:17.110 --> 06:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
utilities followup followup so is this
 
06:01:19.590 --> 06:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill necessary that is a decision for
 
06:01:24.390 --> 06:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.430 --> 06:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
answer representative
 
06:01:30.230 --> 06:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
PL thank you thank you
 
06:01:34.190 --> 06:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
Mr um representative Bernardi answered
 
06:01:36.670 --> 06:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh asked one of them that if I had three
 
06:01:40.708 --> 06:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
properties three utility bills I can
 
06:01:43.670 --> 06:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
correlate the net metering charge with
 
06:01:47.310 --> 06:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
this from each one what percent of that
 
06:01:50.750 --> 06:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
bill would be net metering you could as
 
06:01:53.830 --> 06:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes you could and just to confirm in
 
06:01:56.750 --> 06:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
your thing you says by new uh New
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric utilities all of New
 
06:02:01.788 --> 06:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are you including the co-op
 
06:02:06.030 --> 06:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:08.628 --> 06:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
yeah okay we're starting to cover same
 
06:02:10.310 --> 06:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
territory I'll give the last question to
 
06:02:10.320 --> 06:02:12.990 align:start position:0%
territory I'll give the last question to
representative

06:02:12.990 --> 06:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:16.230 --> 06:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you very much um so we've
 
06:02:17.948 --> 06:02:17.958 align:start position:0%
spent a great deal of time and I don't
 
06:02:19.350 --> 06:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
know if you're the right person to ask
 
06:02:21.910 --> 06:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
this of uh talking about these charges
 
06:02:23.990 --> 06:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
can you give us some specific examples
 
06:02:25.628 --> 06:02:25.638 align:start position:0%
of what these charges are how much does
 
06:02:28.948 --> 06:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
it cost to buy from a a net metering
 
06:02:31.670 --> 06:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
system sure thank you for the question
 
06:02:33.708 --> 06:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
so uh and first off I didn't say it last
 
06:02:37.390 --> 06:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
time but happy birthday um so um if it's
 
06:02:39.030 --> 06:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
all right I'd like to follow up with you
 
06:02:40.948 --> 06:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
for a little bit more information on
 
06:02:43.548 --> 06:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
that um you know I there is something on
 
06:02:45.948 --> 06:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
our website that details the cost of by
 
06:02:48.150 --> 06:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
which net metering customers are
 
06:02:49.750 --> 06:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
compensated I think it'd just be easier
 
06:02:51.030 --> 06:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
if I were to print that off and give it
 
06:02:54.150 --> 06:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
to you um regarding the nonbi the cost
 
06:02:56.270 --> 06:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
there recovered under the entire non-
 
06:02:58.510 --> 06:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
bypassable rate mechan ISM I provided
 
06:02:59.910 --> 06:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
some examples here in my letter of
 
06:03:02.350 --> 06:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
testimony I didn't include all of them
 
06:03:04.270 --> 06:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
if it's helpful I can talk with
 
06:03:05.990 --> 06:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory support and see if we can put
 
06:03:07.868 --> 06:03:07.878 align:start position:0%
up a document
 
06:03:11.548 --> 06:03:11.558 align:start position:0%
yep okay see others uh more questions
 
06:03:13.948 --> 06:03:13.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr rur for your
 
06:03:26.270 --> 06:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:26.280 --> 06:03:37.150 align:start position:0%
 
eversource

06:03:37.150 --> 06:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:39.310 --> 06:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh Michael Lata
 
06:03:39.320 --> 06:03:40.510 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh Michael Lata
representing

06:03:40.510 --> 06:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
representing
 
06:03:43.468 --> 06:03:43.478 align:start position:0%
eversource uh I put two minutes on my
 
06:03:46.590 --> 06:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
card uh maybe we could do it in in one
 
06:03:47.948 --> 06:03:47.958 align:start position:0%
given all the questions that have been
 
06:03:49.628 --> 06:03:49.638 align:start position:0%
asked but I did bring up my laptop in
 
06:03:52.350 --> 06:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
case you uh you stump me on a question
 
06:03:56.628 --> 06:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
so um uh eversource is is neutral on the
 
06:03:56.638 --> 06:03:57.708 align:start position:0%
so um uh eversource is is neutral on the
legislation

06:03:57.708 --> 06:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:03:57.718 --> 06:03:58.590 align:start position:0%
legislation
as

06:03:58.590 --> 06:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:04:02.590 --> 06:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
introduced um as has been discussed
 
06:04:04.750 --> 06:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
eversource does recover the cost of
 
06:04:07.990 --> 06:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
payments to customers um and group host
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
who net meter through the stranded cost
 
06:04:12.830 --> 06:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
recovery charge um this has been the
 
06:04:17.628 --> 06:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
case as stated uh since pu order in
 
06:04:20.190 --> 06:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
2021 uh approving the recovery through
 
06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
the stranded cost recovery charge um I
 
06:04:25.948 --> 06:04:25.958 align:start position:0%
would note and I think um if I
 
06:04:29.070 --> 06:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
understood uh representative V the bill
 
06:04:31.270 --> 06:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor correctly with his proposed
 
06:04:33.230 --> 06:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
amendment I I do think it would be a
 
06:04:35.948 --> 06:04:35.958 align:start position:0%
helpful clarification not to include net
 
06:04:39.310 --> 06:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
metering as in the statutory definition
 
06:04:42.750 --> 06:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
of stranded costs um the stranded cost
 
06:04:45.548 --> 06:04:45.558 align:start position:0%
recovery charge does recover things
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
other than uh what is included in the
 
06:04:51.310 --> 06:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
statutory definition so adding it to
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
that definition I I think is unnecessary
 
06:04:57.230 --> 06:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
and um as has been discussed uh could
 
06:05:00.548 --> 06:05:00.558 align:start position:0%
potentially lead to some level of of
 
06:05:03.430 --> 06:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
confusion um just an example of of
 
06:05:03.440 --> 06:05:04.868 align:start position:0%
confusion um just an example of of
another

06:05:04.868 --> 06:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
another
 
06:05:08.030 --> 06:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
um uh item that is included in the
 
06:05:09.708 --> 06:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery charge that is
 
06:05:11.750 --> 06:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
not a stranded cost uh and I think Mr
 
06:05:14.590 --> 06:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
robar touched upon this but the uh
 
06:05:17.270 --> 06:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
Reggie rebate that customers receive
 
06:05:19.110 --> 06:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
from the proceeds of sales of Reggie
 
06:05:22.310 --> 06:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
allowances that does flow back through
 
06:05:24.708 --> 06:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
uh to all customers through the
 
06:05:28.430 --> 06:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
SCC um I also think the the um uh
 
06:05:30.830 --> 06:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
proposed change to the the second
 
06:05:33.070 --> 06:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
section of the bill uh offering it to be
 
06:05:36.070 --> 06:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
a bit more expansive to include uh other
 
06:05:38.868 --> 06:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
non- bypassable charges uh I think again
 
06:05:41.868 --> 06:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
Mr Roar explained um some of the the
 
06:05:44.150 --> 06:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
benefits uh to that approach although
 
06:05:46.590 --> 06:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
again uh eversource does recover these
 
06:05:48.628 --> 06:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
costs through the SCC stranded cost
 
06:05:51.270 --> 06:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
recovery charge so that would would not
 
06:05:55.468 --> 06:05:55.478 align:start position:0%
impact us um I guess I'll just leave it
 
06:05:57.910 --> 06:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
there and I'd be happy to answer
 
06:05:59.670 --> 06:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh obviously more detailed questions
 
06:06:02.190 --> 06:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
about how we we calculate uh the
 
06:06:04.230 --> 06:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery charge in
 
06:06:07.430 --> 06:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
particular net metering um expenses and
 
06:06:11.190 --> 06:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
credits uh these are filed on an annual
 
06:06:13.788 --> 06:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
basis uh changes to the stranded cost
 
06:06:16.868 --> 06:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
recovery charge uh and those as was
 
06:06:19.948 --> 06:06:19.958 align:start position:0%
previously stated uh are available on
 
06:06:25.070 --> 06:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:28.230 --> 06:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
review presentive Corman
 
06:06:30.110 --> 06:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman thank you Mr
 
06:06:32.548 --> 06:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
lado always good to see you as WE peer
 
06:06:35.868 --> 06:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
around this speaker uh yeah so uh since
 
06:06:37.708 --> 06:06:37.718 align:start position:0%
you invited us to ask you about how
 
06:06:40.670 --> 06:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
eversource calculates the charges uh
 
06:06:43.390 --> 06:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
that's one thing I'd like to know along
 
06:06:46.590 --> 06:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
with uh do these calculations take into
 
06:06:48.590 --> 06:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
account things such as reduced
 
06:06:51.788 --> 06:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
transmission costs reduced distribution
 
06:06:56.310 --> 06:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
costs and also uh other benefits of net
 
06:06:56.320 --> 06:06:57.628 align:start position:0%
costs and also uh other benefits of net
metering

06:06:57.628 --> 06:06:57.638 align:start position:0%
metering
 
06:06:59.868 --> 06:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
so the the way that eversource
 
06:07:04.670 --> 06:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
calculates um net metering ex charge uh
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
included in the SCRC is essentially we
 
06:07:08.868 --> 06:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
take the the payments that have been
 
06:07:10.868 --> 06:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
made to customers for their exported
 
06:07:13.430 --> 06:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
energy which is based on on metering
 
06:07:16.590 --> 06:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
data um and then there is a certain
 
06:07:19.270 --> 06:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
group of customers that we actually um
 
06:07:22.270 --> 06:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
assume responsibility for their energy
 
06:07:24.030 --> 06:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh they are compensated at the net
 
06:07:26.270 --> 06:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
metering rate but we actually resell
 
06:07:29.190 --> 06:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
that that energy into the iso Regional
 
06:07:32.190 --> 06:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market the revenues associated
 
06:07:34.390 --> 06:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
with those sales flow back to all
 
06:07:36.990 --> 06:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
customers as a reduction in those that
 
06:07:40.230 --> 06:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
first Topline expense cost uh so the the
 
06:07:43.110 --> 06:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
net of those two is is the cost
 
06:07:45.910 --> 06:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
Associated um is what the rate is is
 
06:07:49.468 --> 06:07:49.478 align:start position:0%
based off of in terms of reductions in
 
06:07:52.270 --> 06:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
transmission or capacity or or energy
 
06:07:54.670 --> 06:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
purchases um those would manifest
 
06:07:57.110 --> 06:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
themselves uh if they occur through
 
06:07:58.990 --> 06:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
those various different components of
 
06:08:02.070 --> 06:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
the bill so for example if net metering
 
06:08:07.390 --> 06:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
exports reduce um Peak demand uh at a
 
06:08:09.910 --> 06:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
wholesale metering point at the same
 
06:08:13.350 --> 06:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
time that transmission Peak is occurring
 
06:08:14.948 --> 06:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
then all customers would receive a
 
06:08:17.708 --> 06:08:17.718 align:start position:0%
benefit of of reduced uh transmission
 
06:08:20.150 --> 06:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
charges because it's it's based upon the
 
06:08:22.708 --> 06:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:25.628 --> 06:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
use yes uh followup and uh but I'd like
 
06:08:27.670 --> 06:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
to make one comment first um we've asked
 
06:08:29.830 --> 06:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions uh on of of a
 
06:08:32.150 --> 06:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
technical nature here uh and we'll
 
06:08:34.350 --> 06:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
continue to call on for questions but I
 
06:08:36.548 --> 06:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
would ask that the questions be more
 
06:08:38.590 --> 06:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
oriented towards the bill itself in
 
06:08:42.190 --> 06:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
terms of uh why is it being moved from
 
06:08:44.990 --> 06:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
one spot to another versus the Val the
 
06:08:46.590 --> 06:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know versus the value of the
 
06:08:48.390 --> 06:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
actual net metering which is not really
 
06:08:49.788 --> 06:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
the focus of this bill it's just where
 
06:08:51.548 --> 06:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
it's going to be showed up so
 
06:08:53.548 --> 06:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
concentrate questions on that
 
06:08:56.150 --> 06:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr Vice chair I will
 
06:08:57.430 --> 06:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
try to
 
06:09:00.390 --> 06:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh at least Orient my question that way
 
06:09:03.788 --> 06:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
um so as I understand it a customer
 
06:09:05.830 --> 06:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
could actually call up ever eversource
 
06:09:08.190 --> 06:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
right now and say what am I paying for
 
06:09:09.750 --> 06:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
net metering what part of the stranded
 
06:09:12.430 --> 06:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
cost is net metering could a customer
 
06:09:16.110 --> 06:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
also call up and say um what part of the
 
06:09:18.910 --> 06:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
transmission charge am I not paying
 
06:09:20.230 --> 06:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
because of net
 
06:09:20.240 --> 06:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
because of net
meter

06:09:21.990 --> 06:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
meter
 
06:09:25.310 --> 06:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
so if the customer were to request you
 
06:09:27.150 --> 06:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
know what is included included in the
 
06:09:29.390 --> 06:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
Strand you know how much on my bill is
 
06:09:32.230 --> 06:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
associated with energy purchases from
 
06:09:34.230 --> 06:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
net metering we would Point them to the
 
06:09:36.750 --> 06:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery charge uh
 
06:09:38.910 --> 06:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
probably filing and and show them where
 
06:09:41.670 --> 06:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of showing the uh direct
 
06:09:50.190 --> 06:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
attributable reduction in transmission
 
06:09:55.750 --> 06:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
Peak associated with the aggregate um
 
06:09:59.070 --> 06:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
net metering output uh that that is to
 
06:10:00.548 --> 06:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge subject to
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
check not not something that we're able
 
06:10:04.910 --> 06:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
to uh show to customers given current
 
06:10:12.430 --> 06:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:15.868 --> 06:10:15.878 align:start position:0%
systems representative Thomas thank you
 
06:10:19.468 --> 06:10:19.478 align:start position:0%
uh Mr acting chair uh we've had a
 
06:10:22.910 --> 06:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
similar Bill last year now actually
 
06:10:25.390 --> 06:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
where we added a charge to to the
 
06:10:28.030 --> 06:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
eversource bill it was the electricity
 
06:10:29.670 --> 06:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
um I think it was representative
 
06:10:29.680 --> 06:10:30.708 align:start position:0%
um I think it was representative
Thomas's

06:10:30.708 --> 06:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
Thomas's
 
06:10:34.708 --> 06:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
bills cost of the RPS and we heard from
 
06:10:37.110 --> 06:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
the utilities that it would it was going
 
06:10:40.868 --> 06:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
to cost you money to to change the bill
 
06:10:45.030 --> 06:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
and everything would this bill cost you
 
06:10:47.590 --> 06:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
not you but but
 
06:10:50.150 --> 06:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
eversource to you you've got to buy the
 
06:10:51.628 --> 06:10:51.638 align:start position:0%
software you've got to figure out the
 
06:10:53.030 --> 06:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know you've got to program it and
 
06:10:55.350 --> 06:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
everything what is the impact of this
 
06:11:00.468 --> 06:11:00.478 align:start position:0%
bill on rate payer cost sure uh so two
 
06:11:02.628 --> 06:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
two quick things there uh first again I
 
06:11:04.350 --> 06:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
can only speak for eversource not the
 
06:11:08.750 --> 06:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
other uh utility so we do T recover
 
06:11:10.110 --> 06:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
these costs through the Sanic cost
 
06:11:12.110 --> 06:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
recovery charge today as as the bill
 
06:11:14.310 --> 06:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
would direct so this wouldn't really
 
06:11:15.868 --> 06:11:15.878 align:start position:0%
this would not change what we're
 
06:11:18.190 --> 06:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
eversource is doing today so there there
 
06:11:20.628 --> 06:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
would be no no change so no difference
 
06:11:25.510 --> 06:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
and costs and um the RPS legislation
 
06:11:27.150 --> 06:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
from last year
 
06:11:30.110 --> 06:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh was not actually a a bill calculation
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
it was a um a change to the bill uh
 
06:11:36.990 --> 06:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
message uh so that's a predefined field
 
06:11:38.510 --> 06:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I I think there was sensitivity
 
06:11:41.070 --> 06:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
around not wanting to add costs which is
 
06:11:42.990 --> 06:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
why uh it was included in that
 
06:11:44.670 --> 06:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
predefined field so there there wasn't
 
06:11:46.628 --> 06:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
an additional cost associated with that
 
06:11:49.350 --> 06:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
either had there because this goes way
 
06:11:52.430 --> 06:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
back to to the original RPS disclosure
 
06:11:54.150 --> 06:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
discussion had there been you know a
 
06:11:57.510 --> 06:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
desire for a line item calcul
 
06:12:03.628 --> 06:12:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:07.990 --> 06:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
cost representative NL good to hear from
 
06:12:10.830 --> 06:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:12:13.110 --> 06:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm thinking of my
 
06:12:17.670 --> 06:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
bill I have solar panels and on my bill
 
06:12:21.750 --> 06:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
it shows the amount of power that I
 
06:12:24.990 --> 06:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
purchase and use and then the amount of
 
06:12:27.670 --> 06:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
power that I sell
 
06:12:29.430 --> 06:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
what component where where does the net
 
06:12:32.590 --> 06:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
metering calculation show up in that so
 
06:12:35.230 --> 06:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
the the costs that are recovered through
 
06:12:37.708 --> 06:12:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh the stranded cost recovery charge are
 
06:12:40.788 --> 06:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
the payments that we provide to you for
 
06:12:42.948 --> 06:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
energy that you are essentially selling
 
06:12:45.070 --> 06:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
to us putting back onto the distribution
 
06:12:47.910 --> 06:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
system so it is the compensation that we
 
06:12:50.670 --> 06:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
are providing you as a customer so it's
 
06:12:52.670 --> 06:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
the exported credit that you're
 
06:12:56.590 --> 06:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
receiving um and that's based on the Pu
 
06:12:59.590 --> 06:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
tariff rate okay
 
06:13:02.910 --> 06:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
followup followup go ahead so I'm I'm
 
06:13:05.270 --> 06:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
effectively seeing my net metering
 
06:13:08.510 --> 06:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
charges on my monthly bill at that point
 
06:13:09.868 --> 06:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
you are seeing how much you are
 
06:13:12.510 --> 06:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
compensated for that that output correct
 
06:13:17.310 --> 06:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:20.468 --> 06:13:20.478 align:start position:0%
you well I'll call on representative PL
 
06:13:21.868 --> 06:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
next and then I'll give the last
 
06:13:25.350 --> 06:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
question to representative uh M
 
06:13:25.360 --> 06:13:26.868 align:start position:0%
question to representative uh M
leader

06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
leader
 
06:13:30.270 --> 06:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you again Mr Lata um if
 
06:13:34.430 --> 06:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
you could humor me I have I can see the
 
06:13:36.830 --> 06:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
net metering charge I'm working off
 
06:13:40.270 --> 06:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
representative um Corman and in light of
 
06:13:41.750 --> 06:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
my good friend from Stafford
 
06:13:43.310 --> 06:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington isn't here
 
06:13:45.510 --> 06:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
this is where I'm going with
 
06:13:50.110 --> 06:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
that so I have my bill my that payon
 
06:13:51.628 --> 06:13:51.638 align:start position:0%
head a net metering
 
06:13:56.350 --> 06:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
charge the megawatt that I put out from
 
06:13:59.468 --> 06:13:59.478 align:start position:0%
my array on Peak
 
06:14:04.590 --> 06:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
demand would have a price to it a
 
06:14:09.030 --> 06:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
cost that same amount of megawatts put
 
06:14:12.830 --> 06:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
out just into the system without a load
 
06:14:14.868 --> 06:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
would it be the same would I see the
 
06:14:18.270 --> 06:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
same cost or would the algorithm show me
 
06:14:20.310 --> 06:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
the difference because of lower
 
06:14:23.350 --> 06:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
transmission thank you so when you're
 
06:14:26.750 --> 06:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
using the term um charge I I think you
 
06:14:29.430 --> 06:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
mean credit correct so what we're
 
06:14:32.510 --> 06:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
compensating you for that uh exported
 
06:14:36.110 --> 06:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
energy correct correct okay uh so so
 
06:14:39.910 --> 06:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
that is a um uh a rate that is set by
 
06:14:41.750 --> 06:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission and it
 
06:14:45.390 --> 06:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
is a a flat rate um so whenever you are
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
exporting whether it's you know 12
 
06:14:50.230 --> 06:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the afternoon or 5 o'clock in
 
06:14:53.468 --> 06:14:53.478 align:start position:0%
the afternoon uh it's the same uh it is
 
06:14:55.990 --> 06:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
the same level of compensation because
 
06:14:58.390 --> 06:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
it it is also based upon the Energy
 
06:15:00.590 --> 06:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
Service rate which uh does not change
 
06:15:02.910 --> 06:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
06:15:05.948 --> 06:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
day representative McGee you have the
 
06:15:08.830 --> 06:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
last question thank you Mr Vice chairman
 
06:15:10.590 --> 06:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Lata for taking my
 
06:15:13.670 --> 06:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
question so in listening to um
 
06:15:17.230 --> 06:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
representative Noel's uh
 
06:15:20.030 --> 06:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
example if you pay the customer
 
06:15:23.190 --> 06:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
generator or the group host and then you
 
06:15:25.788 --> 06:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
sell the excess energy that's on the
 
06:15:28.390 --> 06:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
distrib ution system to a neighbor and
 
06:15:31.150 --> 06:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
then you recover the full cost that you
 
06:15:33.590 --> 06:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
paid to the original person isn't there
 
06:15:36.310 --> 06:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
a benefit an additional benefit beyond
 
06:15:40.190 --> 06:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of of the
 
06:15:43.590 --> 06:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
energy to to that it cruise to to the
 
06:15:46.270 --> 06:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
utility is what I'm saying oh no so I'm
 
06:15:48.390 --> 06:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
just trying to follow there because
 
06:15:51.708 --> 06:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
there there's a couple steps so um
 
06:15:51.718 --> 06:15:52.830 align:start position:0%
there there's a couple steps so um
exported

06:15:52.830 --> 06:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
exported
 
06:15:56.230 --> 06:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
energy um that we are compensating
 
06:15:58.510 --> 06:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
customers for gets put onto the
 
06:16:01.230 --> 06:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
distribution system the electrons flow
 
06:16:05.190 --> 06:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
where they they're going to flow and so
 
06:16:08.590 --> 06:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
those are energy purchases that we don't
 
06:16:12.350 --> 06:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
make on behalf of customers from the
 
06:16:15.910 --> 06:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
default service supplier yeah um and
 
06:16:18.910 --> 06:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
so keep in mind that default Services is
 
06:16:21.390 --> 06:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
load following so we don't sort of pre-
 
06:16:24.510 --> 06:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
it up front it it follows customer load
 
06:16:28.150 --> 06:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
so so we are essentially um the net
 
06:16:30.548 --> 06:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
metering customers when they are putting
 
06:16:33.150 --> 06:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
energy onto the distribution system they
 
06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
are being compensated for that that
 
06:16:37.390 --> 06:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
energy at the default service price and
 
06:16:39.708 --> 06:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
it is essentially being used to supply
 
06:16:43.708 --> 06:16:43.718 align:start position:0%
other customers there is a a subset
 
06:16:45.750 --> 06:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
category of
 
06:16:48.990 --> 06:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
larger um it's a mix of hydroelectric
 
06:16:52.830 --> 06:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
and and solar generators where we
 
06:16:55.030 --> 06:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
compensate them at the net metering
 
06:16:57.868 --> 06:16:57.878 align:start position:0%
price they're made whole at that price
 
06:17:00.670 --> 06:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh but we actually take um
 
06:17:02.750 --> 06:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility for their exports and
 
06:17:04.830 --> 06:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
resell that into the market it's sold at
 
06:17:06.830 --> 06:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
the wholesale price and that provides a
 
06:17:09.830 --> 06:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
credit credit back it's a a smaller
 
06:17:13.150 --> 06:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
group uh and so any revenues that that
 
06:17:18.430 --> 06:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
the utility receives any um uh uh
 
06:17:20.310 --> 06:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
purchases that we we don't have to make
 
06:17:23.788 --> 06:17:23.798 align:start position:0%
that all flows back to
 
06:17:26.628 --> 06:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
customers is it just
 
06:17:28.468 --> 06:17:28.478 align:start position:0%
yeah is it
 
06:17:32.350 --> 06:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
um does it get counted as load reduction
 
06:17:34.230 --> 06:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of like energy you don't have
 
06:17:39.150 --> 06:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
to acquire yeah so so in terms of um the
 
06:17:42.510 --> 06:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
the Energy Service component it is
 
06:17:44.310 --> 06:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
purchases we we don't have to make it's
 
06:17:47.708 --> 06:17:47.718 align:start position:0%
served by by um that energy that we're
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
buying from the uh from the net meter
 
06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
customer but but that term load
 
06:17:55.990 --> 06:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
reduction gets you know sort of broadly
 
06:17:57.670 --> 06:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
applied so there are other components of
 
06:18:02.990 --> 06:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
the bill as well um that you know folks
 
06:18:07.910 --> 06:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh discuss applying that
 
06:18:11.510 --> 06:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
to okay fur those questions uh thank you
 
06:18:15.190 --> 06:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Lata I would like to introduce next
 
06:18:19.270 --> 06:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Nick Paul from clean energy who I'm
 
06:18:22.070 --> 06:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
sure he will tell us why he uh does not
 
06:18:24.590 --> 06:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
want all utilities to uh put net
 
06:18:28.910 --> 06:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:30.750 --> 06:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
Annie has written testimony as well that
 
06:18:33.110 --> 06:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
was very appreci of you
 
06:18:35.788 --> 06:18:35.798 align:start position:0%
um I I will note that I was very brief
 
06:18:37.750 --> 06:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
on that last bill and I've rece uh
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
received zero cupcakes so I make no
 
06:18:42.030 --> 06:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
guarantees uh going
 
06:18:46.150 --> 06:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
forward uh HB 1398 as written uh would
 
06:18:47.708 --> 06:18:47.718 align:start position:0%
add costs related to the purchase of
 
06:18:50.390 --> 06:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
electricity from customer generators as
 
06:18:52.110 --> 06:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
permitted by RSA
 
06:18:55.390 --> 06:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
3629 to the definition of stranded costs
 
06:19:25.788 --> 06:19:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:27.670 --> 06:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
ided accounting that has long
 
06:19:29.830 --> 06:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
characterized the arguments of those who
 
06:19:32.708 --> 06:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
oppose allowing net metering to continue
 
06:19:35.030 --> 06:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh specifically uh detailing only the
 
06:19:37.150 --> 06:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
costs of this policy while accounting
 
06:19:38.510 --> 06:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
for none of the
 
06:19:40.948 --> 06:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
benefits notably this proposal comes at
 
06:19:42.548 --> 06:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
a time when the concern that there may
 
06:19:44.310 --> 06:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
exist a cost shift you're all familiar
 
06:19:46.750 --> 06:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
with that term uh between net muing
 
06:19:48.548 --> 06:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
participating customers and their
 
06:19:51.030 --> 06:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
non-participating neighbors has now been
 
06:19:53.910 --> 06:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
put to rest by information and Analysis
 
06:19:55.510 --> 06:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
that has been presented at the regional
 
06:19:58.430 --> 06:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
and state level uh data that is now
 
06:20:00.990 --> 06:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
available as a result of actual system
 
06:20:02.910 --> 06:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
performance and impact have shown a
 
06:20:05.350 --> 06:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrable financial benefit to the
 
06:20:07.548 --> 06:20:07.558 align:start position:0%
electric grid from distributed Renewable
 
06:20:10.390 --> 06:20:10.400 align:start position:0%

06:20:16.628 --> 06:20:16.638 align:start position:0%
Energy Regulatory Commission meeting on
 
06:20:20.070 --> 06:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
June 20th 2023 when ISO New England uh
 
06:20:21.788 --> 06:20:21.798 align:start position:0%
the New England Regional grid operator
 
06:20:24.110 --> 06:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
released a new analysis that found that
 
06:20:25.910 --> 06:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
Mystic station one of the regions
 
06:20:28.310 --> 06:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
largest natural gas fired power plants
 
06:20:31.590 --> 06:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
fueled exclusively by imported LG is no
 
06:20:34.270 --> 06:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
longer needed for reliability the iso
 
06:20:36.150 --> 06:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
New England analysis credited stronger
 
06:20:37.830 --> 06:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
than expected growth and distributed
 
06:20:41.030 --> 06:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
solar power as one of the key reasons
 
06:20:43.788 --> 06:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
allowing for this retirement uh to be
 
06:20:43.798 --> 06:20:44.670 align:start position:0%
allowing for this retirement uh to be
more

06:20:44.670 --> 06:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:20:46.910 --> 06:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
precise ISO New England cited the
 
06:20:48.350 --> 06:20:48.360 align:start position:0%

its explanation for why uh they are now
 
06:20:56.548 --> 06:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
comfortable with allowing Mystic to shut

down the iso New England Chief Operating
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
Officer was quoted as saying that ISO
 
06:21:02.628 --> 06:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
New England was surprised to see this
 
06:21:04.590 --> 06:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
amount of substantial winter capacity
 
06:21:06.548 --> 06:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
produced by behind the meter
 
06:21:08.788 --> 06:21:08.798 align:start position:0%

06:21:10.990 --> 06:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
intermittent act as fuel
 
06:21:14.030 --> 06:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
Savers when behind the meter solar is uh
 
06:21:16.270 --> 06:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
produced during cold winter days the
 
06:21:18.390 --> 06:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
Region's dispatchable resources are able
 
06:21:21.230 --> 06:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
to conserve limited onsite fuel or gas
 
06:21:24.030 --> 06:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
under contract this means the region can
 
06:21:25.830 --> 06:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
endure longer cold snaps during during
 
06:21:27.830 --> 06:21:27.840 align:start position:0%

Efficiency resources is significant uh
 
06:21:36.750 --> 06:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
as Mystic station has been operating on

since June of 2022 and that agreement
 
06:21:43.750 --> 06:21:43.760 align:start position:0%

is
 
06:22:33.708 --> 06:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
conducted that study was initially
 
06:22:35.390 --> 06:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
published in October
 
06:22:37.990 --> 06:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
2022 and an amended version was issued
 
06:22:40.350 --> 06:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
in 2023 to account for significant

Russian invasion of Ukraine the Topline
 
06:22:47.548 --> 06:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
finding in both of these versions was
 
06:22:48.948 --> 06:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
that net metering systems in New
 
06:22:51.110 --> 06:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could result in a modest cost
 
06:22:52.230 --> 06:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
shift to
 
06:22:54.548 --> 06:22:54.558 align:start position:0%
nonparticipants in the newest pu
 
06:22:56.390 --> 06:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
proceeding to take up the question of

net metering compensation that stocket
 
06:23:02.150 --> 06:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh number de
 
06:23:05.030 --> 06:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
22-06 both the joint utilities and the
 
06:23:06.548 --> 06:23:06.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy
 
06:23:08.868 --> 06:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
introduced testimony that supported
 
06:23:12.070 --> 06:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
extending the existing tariff uh as this
 
06:23:14.788 --> 06:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
level of cost shift was consistent with
 
06:23:16.788 --> 06:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
the cost shift experienced in other
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
parts of rate
 
06:23:20.788 --> 06:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
setting however uh when cnh's
 
06:23:23.150 --> 06:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
Consultants conducted a deep analysis of
 
06:23:25.430 --> 06:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
the model used to perform the de value
 
06:23:28.310 --> 06:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
valuation study uh they found that while
 
06:23:30.548 --> 06:23:30.558 align:start position:0%
the model was robust there were a number
 
06:23:33.310 --> 06:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
of incorrect assumptions being utilized
 
06:23:35.070 --> 06:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
when those assumptions were updated Not
 
06:23:37.270 --> 06:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
only was the cost shift entirely erased
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
across all customer classes but the
 
06:23:41.910 --> 06:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
analysis also demonstrated the net
 
06:23:44.910 --> 06:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
energy metering uh provides an economic
 
06:23:48.350 --> 06:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
benefit not only to those who install uh
 
06:23:51.628 --> 06:23:51.638 align:start position:0%
distributed energy re resources onsite
 
06:23:54.230 --> 06:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
but to customers who don't as well more
 
06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
specifically uh the revised analysis
 
06:23:59.150 --> 06:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
found that the average non-et metering
 
06:24:02.350 --> 06:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
residential customers would experience a
 
06:24:05.110 --> 06:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh 4% reduction in their bills between
 
06:24:09.628 --> 06:24:09.638 align:start position:0%
2021 and 2020 2035 excuse me the average
 
06:24:12.628 --> 06:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
nonn net metering small and large
 
06:24:14.910 --> 06:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
commercial uh customer in New Hampshire
 
06:24:17.390 --> 06:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
would see their bills fall by 6% and
 
06:24:20.868 --> 06:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
0.9% respectively cumul
 
06:24:22.868 --> 06:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
cumulatively I always struggle with that
 
06:24:25.670 --> 06:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
word our analysis finds uh that net
 
06:24:27.670 --> 06:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
metering results in an average of a net
 
06:24:31.670 --> 06:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
$8 million benefit from non uh de
 
06:24:35.110 --> 06:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
customers each year importantly cen's
 
06:24:37.708 --> 06:24:37.718 align:start position:0%
updated analysis has not been challenged
 
06:24:40.230 --> 06:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
in the follow-up steps of the proceeding
 
06:24:42.990 --> 06:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
finally uh we are also concerned that
 
06:24:44.590 --> 06:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is being brought forth during
 
06:24:46.628 --> 06:24:46.638 align:start position:0%
the active pu docket that I mentioned
 
06:24:48.910 --> 06:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
before number de
 
06:24:51.868 --> 06:24:51.878 align:start position:0%
22-0060 this docket has already been
 
06:24:53.990 --> 06:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
underway for more than a year has
 
06:24:55.948 --> 06:24:55.958 align:start position:0%
benefited from considerable work over
 
06:24:58.270 --> 06:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
the past eight years and includes the
 
06:24:59.910 --> 06:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
full range of stakeholders who are
 
06:25:02.628 --> 06:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
considering the full range of costs and
 
06:25:05.510 --> 06:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
benefits Associated uh with net metering
 
06:25:07.708 --> 06:25:07.718 align:start position:0%
systems inclusive of energy supply
 
06:25:09.990 --> 06:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
distribution and transmission
 
06:25:12.750 --> 06:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
compensation to the extent that uh net
 
06:25:15.948 --> 06:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
costs exist the Pu and stakeholders will
 
06:25:18.350 --> 06:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
be proposing how they are reflected in
 
06:25:20.430 --> 06:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
the final net metering tariffs that
 
06:25:22.350 --> 06:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
docket is anticipated to conclude
 
06:25:24.310 --> 06:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously with the 2024
 
06:25:26.270 --> 06:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
06:25:28.350 --> 06:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
as electricity consumption is projected
 
06:25:30.390 --> 06:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
to increase in the coming decades it is
 
06:25:32.350 --> 06:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate to continue to incentivize
 
06:25:34.788 --> 06:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
these systems as they are the fastest
 
06:25:37.548 --> 06:25:37.558 align:start position:0%
means to expand electric generation over
 
06:25:39.310 --> 06:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
the coming decade as New Hampshire and
 
06:25:42.310 --> 06:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
New England at large await the arrival
 
06:25:44.628 --> 06:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
uh of newer of new larger sources of
 
06:25:46.708 --> 06:25:46.718 align:start position:0%
electric power and the transmission
 
06:25:48.910 --> 06:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
needed to bring uh their supply to
 
06:25:51.430 --> 06:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
Market uh with data in hand showing that
 
06:25:54.310 --> 06:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
the net metering uh that net metering is
 
06:25:56.590 --> 06:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
resulting in a net cost savings to all
 
06:25:59.030 --> 06:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
customers regardless of participation in
 
06:26:00.990 --> 06:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
the state's net meter and program and
 
06:26:02.468 --> 06:26:02.478 align:start position:0%
with the state currently gripped by an
 
06:26:04.788 --> 06:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
energy affordability crisis uh we find
 
06:26:07.750 --> 06:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
this bill to be unnecessary and we urge
 
06:26:09.510 --> 06:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh the committee to recommend this bill
 
06:26:12.110 --> 06:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
as inexpedient to legislate thank you
 
06:26:14.110 --> 06:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
for bearing with me uh included in your
 
06:26:18.750 --> 06:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
testimony is this uh Nifty chart uh
 
06:26:21.548 --> 06:26:21.558 align:start position:0%
which in part demonstrates the findings
 
06:26:24.270 --> 06:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh of that study that I cited it is Al
 
06:26:25.830 --> 06:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
also cited directly in my written
 
06:26:27.788 --> 06:26:27.798 align:start position:0%
testimony would encourage everyone to
 
06:26:30.628 --> 06:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and um would be happy
 
06:26:33.750 --> 06:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
to follow up with anybody uh later about
 
06:26:35.590 --> 06:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
questions that they have about
 
06:26:37.830 --> 06:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
it thank you before I get to the first
 
06:26:39.628 --> 06:26:39.638 align:start position:0%
question and I realize we haven't said
 
06:26:42.270 --> 06:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
that uh we haven't said this this year
 
06:26:44.390 --> 06:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
but I know we've said before in the past
 
06:26:46.150 --> 06:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
and uh and and you're relatively new
 
06:26:48.310 --> 06:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
coming to this committee relatively
 
06:26:49.868 --> 06:26:49.878 align:start position:0%
compared to before you would like me to
 
06:26:52.548 --> 06:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
not read my testimony I would like for
 
06:26:54.350 --> 06:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
people to if you have written testimony
 
06:26:55.590 --> 06:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
pass it around first first and then
 
06:26:57.510 --> 06:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
please summarize what's in the written
 
06:27:00.670 --> 06:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
testimony at least the sing points uh I
 
06:27:02.910 --> 06:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
think well most of us older people can
 
06:27:06.430 --> 06:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
read so we could we can uh probably read
 
06:27:09.030 --> 06:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
that but thank you anyway U uh and no no
 
06:27:11.350 --> 06:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
reflection I'm just reminding everybody
 
06:27:14.990 --> 06:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh that comes uh uh I know one person
 
06:27:18.830 --> 06:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
can speak from without even notes I
 
06:27:21.270 --> 06:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
know I I certainly can't but I'll try to
 
06:27:22.948 --> 06:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
be uh charismatic enough to keep
 
06:27:25.788 --> 06:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
everyone's attention that no problem can
 
06:27:27.990 --> 06:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
he can he have a cupcake of course he
 
06:27:29.310 --> 06:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
can he can have two I don't actually
 
06:27:31.150 --> 06:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
want a cupcake I just I just I have a
 
06:27:33.070 --> 06:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
rule that opening with a joke is always
 
06:27:35.150 --> 06:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
always a better policy than not we I
 
06:27:36.350 --> 06:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody wants to bite in a
 
06:27:39.070 --> 06:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
morie that's the only thing it's really
 
06:27:41.548 --> 06:27:41.558 align:start position:0%
okay represent Reynolds you have a
 
06:27:44.510 --> 06:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr Vice chairman um
 
06:27:46.788 --> 06:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um during
 
06:27:52.708 --> 06:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
it you referred to um two slides that
 
06:27:57.910 --> 06:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
ISO New England showed during a firk
 
06:28:01.350 --> 06:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
recent firk proceeding are those
 
06:28:04.590 --> 06:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
slides also uh included in your written
 
06:28:06.350 --> 06:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
testimony or could they be they are
 
06:28:07.868 --> 06:28:07.878 align:start position:0%
cited in a footnote here and I believe
 
06:28:10.350 --> 06:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
that there is a
 
06:28:13.150 --> 06:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
link yep that yep it will be footnote
 
06:28:16.548 --> 06:28:16.558 align:start position:0%
number two on page two okay so we could
 
06:28:18.548 --> 06:28:18.558 align:start position:0%
click on that footnote and get those
 
06:28:21.150 --> 06:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
slides is that the idea uh if you would
 
06:28:22.628 --> 06:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
like a digital copy I will make sure
 
06:28:24.070 --> 06:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
that you can copy and paste but you can
 
06:28:26.390 --> 06:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
also type it in thank you whichever you
 
06:28:28.948 --> 06:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
like if you have a digital copy if you
 
06:28:32.230 --> 06:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
could just email it to our uh I'm I'm
 
06:28:34.230 --> 06:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
gonna pass around physical copies now
 
06:28:35.910 --> 06:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
but uh if people would if you do send
 
06:28:38.270 --> 06:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
out a digital copy please make sure you
 
06:28:40.510 --> 06:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
send it to the committee office so that
 
06:28:43.190 --> 06:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
everybody gets it you beta okay next any
 
06:28:45.270 --> 06:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
other questions awesome I'll see no
 
06:28:50.708 --> 06:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:55.030 --> 06:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
much next on a Mr Paul button from is it
 
06:28:56.910 --> 06:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
e Au or
 
06:29:16.868 --> 06:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:19.750 --> 06:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
yours yeah my name is Paul button uh
 
06:29:23.190 --> 06:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
company is energy audits unlimited
 
06:29:27.310 --> 06:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
EA um it is is a I'm a small businessman
 
06:29:29.390 --> 06:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
have my business out of Manchester New
 
06:29:33.708 --> 06:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and basically I facilitate um
 
06:29:36.910 --> 06:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
I facilitate owners of alternative
 
06:29:39.628 --> 06:29:39.638 align:start position:0%
energy sources to recover their
 
06:29:41.390 --> 06:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
06:29:41.400 --> 06:29:43.350 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
credits

06:29:43.350 --> 06:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
credits
 
06:29:48.948 --> 06:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
um so that's basically who I am um so
 
06:29:51.468 --> 06:29:51.478 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative Summers has
 
06:29:55.110 --> 06:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
left but um she actually said said
 
06:29:56.990 --> 06:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
something that I had kind of made a a
 
06:29:59.030 --> 06:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
note of here
 
06:30:02.150 --> 06:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
handwritten um about double
 
06:30:05.070 --> 06:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
dipping maybe one of the unintended
 
06:30:13.390 --> 06:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
consequences of uh of this bill uh
 
06:30:16.390 --> 06:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
so first of all I'm not a lawyer and I
 
06:30:19.910 --> 06:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't speak legal e okay I'm just a Joe
 
06:30:22.948 --> 06:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
sixpack smuck I speak
 
06:30:25.390 --> 06:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
American um
 
06:30:28.310 --> 06:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
so my the way I see it is that the
 
06:30:30.948 --> 06:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
utilities pay money for net
 
06:30:34.510 --> 06:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
power and then they sell it back to
 
06:30:39.310 --> 06:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
us um and so she had mentioned double
 
06:30:42.868 --> 06:30:42.878 align:start position:0%
dipping um first of
 
06:30:46.350 --> 06:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
all they do buy the power from
 
06:30:46.360 --> 06:30:48.110 align:start position:0%
all they do buy the power from
alternative

06:30:48.110 --> 06:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
06:30:52.590 --> 06:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
sources um but they don't they don't pay
 
06:30:54.548 --> 06:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
that much for the kilowatt coming off
 
06:30:59.350 --> 06:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
that source so it's actually um cheaper
 
06:31:01.548 --> 06:31:01.558 align:start position:0%
for them to buy the power from
 
06:31:04.990 --> 06:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
alternative source and if you go back to
 
06:31:08.150 --> 06:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
the uh adage of um you know the best
 
06:31:11.708 --> 06:31:11.718 align:start position:0%
energy saved is the energy that's not
 
06:31:16.150 --> 06:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
used so these guys are making money by
 
06:31:18.990 --> 06:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
not spending money
 
06:31:21.948 --> 06:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
basically so then they sell it back to
 
06:31:25.628 --> 06:31:25.638 align:start position:0%
us at um increased prices and so my
 
06:31:28.670 --> 06:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
question is Jermain to this Committee
 
06:31:33.468 --> 06:31:33.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:37.708 --> 06:31:37.718 align:start position:0%
stranded for something to qualify as
 
06:31:40.030 --> 06:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
stranded and thus recoverable as
 
06:31:44.270 --> 06:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
stranded it must be something that quote
 
06:31:46.990 --> 06:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
that may not be recoverable once the
 
06:31:51.388 --> 06:31:51.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:53.708 --> 06:31:53.718 align:start position:0%
competition which is why a cost become
 
06:31:56.388 --> 06:31:56.398 align:start position:0%
stranded in the first
 
06:31:59.868 --> 06:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
place so what exactly are the restrained
 
06:32:05.430 --> 06:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
costs this bill is or this amendment um
 
06:32:08.868 --> 06:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
is referring to I mean we talking power
 
06:32:13.030 --> 06:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
plants are we talking distribution
 
06:32:16.110 --> 06:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure are we talking piles of
 
06:32:20.150 --> 06:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:22.708 --> 06:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
meters and I guess I need to ask a
 
06:32:25.150 --> 06:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
question I mean did did the utility
 
06:32:28.430 --> 06:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
actually ask for this bill as far as I
 
06:32:30.830 --> 06:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
hear eversource is
 
06:32:34.590 --> 06:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
neutral so where do this bill come
 
06:32:34.600 --> 06:32:36.830 align:start position:0%
neutral so where do this bill come
from

06:32:36.830 --> 06:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:32:40.070 --> 06:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion
 
06:32:45.510 --> 06:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
again it's a u it seems to be an attempt
 
06:32:46.670 --> 06:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
by the
 
06:32:50.788 --> 06:32:50.798 align:start position:0%
utilities to write their profit margins
 
06:32:53.350 --> 06:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
into state
 
06:32:56.590 --> 06:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:58.830 --> 06:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
I won't read this next part because
 
06:32:58.840 --> 06:33:00.628 align:start position:0%
I won't read this next part because
it's

06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:33:00.638 --> 06:33:03.670 align:start position:0%
it's
okay

06:33:03.670 --> 06:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:06.350 --> 06:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
um and I had mentioned before in PR
 
06:33:09.270 --> 06:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that um I I referred
 
06:33:15.670 --> 06:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
to this whole idea of um as a legalized
 
06:33:19.110 --> 06:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
ly and I stand by
 
06:33:22.310 --> 06:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
that um it's legal because it's in the
 
06:33:24.910 --> 06:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
law and it's lashy because with dealing
 
06:33:27.350 --> 06:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
with numbers in excess of
 
06:33:27.360 --> 06:33:29.230 align:start position:0%
with numbers in excess of
$1,500

06:33:29.230 --> 06:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
$1,500
 
06:33:29.240 --> 06:33:32.070 align:start position:0%
$1,500
so

06:33:32.070 --> 06:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:33:34.270 --> 06:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:33:37.910 --> 06:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
um basically what's happening is is
 
06:33:40.510 --> 06:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
that the the lawyers and the lobbyist
 
06:33:42.190 --> 06:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
for the utilities are coming in on a
 
06:33:42.200 --> 06:33:43.230 align:start position:0%
for the utilities are coming in on a
daily

06:33:43.230 --> 06:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
daily
 
06:33:47.430 --> 06:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
basis um with motions and and appeals
 
06:33:50.070 --> 06:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
and stuff basically dumping on your
 
06:33:52.868 --> 06:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
desks and stopping you from doing the
 
06:33:56.708 --> 06:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
people's work for which you were
 
06:34:00.070 --> 06:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
elected um this is what happened when
 
06:34:03.030 --> 06:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 362 was originally
 
06:34:05.948 --> 06:34:05.958 align:start position:0%
enacted the utilities failed in their
 
06:34:07.830 --> 06:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
attempt to exclude certain Clauses in
 
06:34:11.948 --> 06:34:11.958 align:start position:0%
the law that would invoke the
 
06:34:15.670 --> 06:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
ACP um alternative compliance
 
06:34:18.708 --> 06:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
payment um they simply never published
 
06:34:21.310 --> 06:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
any any info about Rex which is the
 
06:34:23.270 --> 06:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
focus of my business but not the focus
 
06:34:25.788 --> 06:34:25.798 align:start position:0%
of this meeting
 
06:34:28.350 --> 06:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
um they never they never published any
 
06:34:32.110 --> 06:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
info about Rec that were created by law
 
06:34:35.388 --> 06:34:35.398 align:start position:0%
and that same state law said that any
 
06:34:38.030 --> 06:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
unclaimed recks could be
 
06:34:40.948 --> 06:34:40.958 align:start position:0%
swept by the
 
06:34:44.468 --> 06:34:44.478 align:start position:0%
utilities then these found
 
06:34:48.350 --> 06:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
wrecks then grandly listed on the menu
 
06:34:50.070 --> 06:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
and served up to the
 
06:34:53.990 --> 06:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
Pu by a weight staff of the same said
 
06:34:56.070 --> 06:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
Army of corporate
 
06:34:59.788 --> 06:34:59.798 align:start position:0%
flunkies no offense anybody in the
 
06:35:03.590 --> 06:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
room personally as proof that they are
 
06:35:07.670 --> 06:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
quote good green corporate
 
06:35:09.548 --> 06:35:09.558 align:start position:0%
citizens how
 
06:35:12.548 --> 06:35:12.558 align:start position:0%
convenient except that the word swept is
 
06:35:15.230 --> 06:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
spelled s t o
 
06:35:18.310 --> 06:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
Len on their
 
06:35:23.388 --> 06:35:23.398 align:start position:0%
menu and it's listed as a dish called
 
06:35:23.398 --> 06:35:25.110 align:start position:0%
menu and it's listed as a dish called
greenwashing

06:35:25.110 --> 06:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
greenwashing
 
06:35:30.628 --> 06:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:33.230 --> 06:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
ly all right well I was going to read I
 
06:35:35.468 --> 06:35:35.478 align:start position:0%
was going to try to be clever here but I
 
06:35:39.350 --> 06:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
think I've overdone my time um I'm just
 
06:35:42.110 --> 06:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
going to say that
 
06:35:45.190 --> 06:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
um with and again I'm talking
 
06:35:47.670 --> 06:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
specifically about my my
 
06:35:50.510 --> 06:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
business um with the wrecks that are no
 
06:35:50.520 --> 06:35:52.070 align:start position:0%
business um with the wrecks that are no
longer

06:35:52.070 --> 06:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
longer
 
06:35:55.750 --> 06:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
attractive um
 
06:35:58.030 --> 06:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
investment in solar projects or in
 
06:36:01.510 --> 06:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
general Alternative Energy uh you uh
 
06:36:04.788 --> 06:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
assets are um this undermines the
 
06:36:07.150 --> 06:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
structure of a possible distributed
 
06:36:11.270 --> 06:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
generation model which is an aema to
 
06:36:13.830 --> 06:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
their monopolistic
 
06:36:16.468 --> 06:36:16.478 align:start position:0%
model unfortunately for the utilities
 
06:36:19.350 --> 06:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
Grassroots organizations like CP
 
06:36:22.270 --> 06:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
cnh have offered very reasonable pricing
 
06:36:25.430 --> 06:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
for energy supplied and the utilities in
 
06:36:32.510 --> 06:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:32.520 --> 06:36:34.990 align:start position:0%
 
increase

06:36:34.990 --> 06:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:36:37.788 --> 06:36:37.798 align:start position:0%
so to leave it hanging any questions I
 
06:36:40.468 --> 06:36:40.478 align:start position:0%
guess I'd be willing to
 
06:36:43.788 --> 06:36:43.798 align:start position:0%
answer no see no questions thank you
 
06:36:45.190 --> 06:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony sir
 
06:36:47.948 --> 06:36:47.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you all I'm going to
 
06:36:52.270 --> 06:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
call next on The Honorable bill babber
 
06:36:55.708 --> 06:36:55.718 align:start position:0%
up to here um and for those of you that
 
06:36:57.868 --> 06:36:57.878 align:start position:0%
remember that Mi uh The Honorable babber
 
06:37:00.150 --> 06:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
was a prior member of this
 
06:37:03.548 --> 06:37:03.558 align:start position:0%
committee we've been here too long um
 
06:37:07.230 --> 06:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
but a welcome back good to see you uh Mr
 
06:37:09.310 --> 06:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
babber and the floor is
 
06:37:12.030 --> 06:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
yours well thank you it's a pleasure to
 
06:37:14.750 --> 06:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
be back here I think
 
06:37:17.190 --> 06:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
um the uh I just wanted to make two
 
06:37:20.388 --> 06:37:20.398 align:start position:0%
simple points and uh one is I think it's
 
06:37:24.310 --> 06:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's timing the uh pu has been investiga
 
06:37:27.190 --> 06:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
ating net metering um for net metering
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
30 for some time now and we'll make a
 
06:37:33.430 --> 06:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
decision on this uh within your session
 
06:37:37.150 --> 06:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
and it could grossly reshape um you know
 
06:37:39.788 --> 06:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
anything that might be done uh in terms
 
06:37:42.270 --> 06:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
of net metering and particularly
 
06:37:44.830 --> 06:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
payments and this might totally be
 
06:37:47.388 --> 06:37:47.398 align:start position:0%
evaporated at that point so the timing
 
06:37:50.910 --> 06:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
just seems U premature um to make this
 
06:37:53.230 --> 06:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
change the other point I wanted to make
 
06:37:55.670 --> 06:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
is that I think trans experien is a a
 
06:37:59.948 --> 06:37:59.958 align:start position:0%
really Noble goal and I know U from 10
 
06:38:01.910 --> 06:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
years ago that you know many of the
 
06:38:04.150 --> 06:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
questions that you're asking today we
 
06:38:06.910 --> 06:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
were asking then and the problem is that
 
06:38:09.670 --> 06:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
there is an absence of data you know
 
06:38:12.070 --> 06:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's an absence of richness on bills
 
06:38:14.670 --> 06:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
so you can actually understand precisely
 
06:38:16.910 --> 06:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're being charged for or
 
06:38:19.510 --> 06:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
being compensated for and most of all
 
06:38:22.150 --> 06:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
there's an absence of Rich data that you
 
06:38:23.868 --> 06:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
would be able to make these decisions
 
06:38:25.750 --> 06:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
BAS based on where are all these
 
06:38:27.910 --> 06:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
electrons going who's generating them
 
06:38:30.830 --> 06:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
who's benefiting them you know where are
 
06:38:33.350 --> 06:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
the costs being incurred it's all about
 
06:38:35.750 --> 06:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
cost but you know trying to find that
 
06:38:38.868 --> 06:38:38.878 align:start position:0%
public data that would support making a
 
06:38:42.270 --> 06:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
you know understood a an intelligent
 
06:38:44.388 --> 06:38:44.398 align:start position:0%
decision on where they ought to be
 
06:38:47.468 --> 06:38:47.478 align:start position:0%
placed is totally absent so I think that
 
06:38:49.708 --> 06:38:49.718 align:start position:0%
you know that's where I would encourage
 
06:38:52.070 --> 06:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
you to spend more time if you have an
 
06:38:54.230 --> 06:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity in this session that's
 
06:38:58.990 --> 06:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:01.548 --> 06:39:01.558 align:start position:0%
you let me just say thank you for coming
 
06:39:03.230 --> 06:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
it was a pleasure to see you back here
 
06:39:08.468 --> 06:39:08.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:11.190 --> 06:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other speakers I will be
 
06:39:13.670 --> 06:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
calling on Mr
 
06:39:17.230 --> 06:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
Clifton bow who needs actually needs no
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:23.040 --> 06:39:24.868 align:start position:0%
 
notes

06:39:24.868 --> 06:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
notes
 
06:39:26.948 --> 06:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
although I do have written testimony and
 
06:39:29.628 --> 06:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
with me if uh she could join me is our
 
06:39:32.270 --> 06:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
new director of legisl regulatory and
 
06:39:35.670 --> 06:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs uh Dena Dennis and
 
06:39:39.310 --> 06:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
uh she'll contribute a little bit here
 
06:39:42.868 --> 06:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
um I am uh here to speak on behalf of
 
06:39:45.030 --> 06:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
the community power Coalition of New
 
06:39:47.230 --> 06:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh which has officially taken
 
06:39:50.468 --> 06:39:50.478 align:start position:0%
a position to oppose this uh passage of
 
06:39:52.388 --> 06:39:52.398 align:start position:0%
this bill as
 
06:39:56.110 --> 06:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
introduced um but before I explain why I
 
06:39:58.430 --> 06:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like Dina just to provide a quick
 
06:40:00.310 --> 06:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
update on the
 
06:40:02.868 --> 06:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
Coalition uh where we are today compared
 
06:40:04.750 --> 06:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
to a year ago when we last appeared
 
06:40:07.948 --> 06:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:10.510 --> 06:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee good afternoon um Vice
 
06:40:12.708 --> 06:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
chairman Thomas members of the committee

thank you so much for your time and
 
06:40:16.868 --> 06:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
attention this afternoon um I wanted to
 
06:40:18.990 --> 06:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
just take a minute or two to hopefully
 
06:40:23.030 --> 06:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
provide some helpful context um into the
 
06:40:25.670 --> 06:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh reasons for why uh the co the
 
06:40:27.030 --> 06:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition of New
 
06:40:29.990 --> 06:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um opposes this bill um so
 
06:40:32.230 --> 06:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
first off uh Community power Coalition
 
06:40:34.750 --> 06:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire or CB cnh is a
 
06:40:37.310 --> 06:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
governmental instrum instrumentality um
 
06:40:39.150 --> 06:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
created to serve member Municipal
 
06:40:41.628 --> 06:40:41.638 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions pursuant to a joint Powers
 
06:40:45.910 --> 06:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
agreement under RSA 53-a and
 
06:40:48.350 --> 06:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
53- the last time we appeared before
 
06:40:50.430 --> 06:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
this committee which was before my time
 
06:40:53.350 --> 06:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
it was Clif in then um we were just 26
 
06:40:55.750 --> 06:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
members strong um since then our
 
06:40:58.510 --> 06:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
membership has doubled we're now at 53
 
06:41:02.150 --> 06:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
members including six cities 45 towns
 
06:41:03.310 --> 06:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
and two
 
06:41:06.628 --> 06:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
counties um we have launched 14
 
06:41:09.670 --> 06:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation programs um
 
06:41:09.680 --> 06:41:10.670 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation programs um
in

06:41:10.670 --> 06:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:41:13.910 --> 06:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
2023 um that serve about 880,000
 
06:41:16.788 --> 06:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
customers in 2024 we're preparing to
 
06:41:20.030 --> 06:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
launch about uh 25 more in the first
 
06:41:23.990 --> 06:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
half of 2024 and then um another several
 
06:41:26.628 --> 06:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
toward the latter half of
 
06:41:30.190 --> 06:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
2024 um and this year cbcn will become
 
06:41:33.548 --> 06:41:33.558 align:start position:0%
the second largest power supplier in the
 
06:41:36.590 --> 06:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
state um and our member municipalities
 
06:41:39.110 --> 06:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
in total represent about 30% of the
 
06:41:39.120 --> 06:41:40.868 align:start position:0%
in total represent about 30% of the
state's

06:41:40.868 --> 06:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
state's
 
06:41:44.628 --> 06:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
population um I really want to uh take a
 
06:41:47.270 --> 06:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
moment to thank um the leadership of
 
06:41:49.868 --> 06:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
chairman Bose um and members of this
 
06:41:52.590 --> 06:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
committee um and the general court that
 
06:41:56.270 --> 06:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
in 2021 passed House Bill 315 that
 
06:42:00.110 --> 06:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
completed an important update um to RSA
 
06:42:02.510 --> 06:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
53- um that enabled the launch of
 
06:42:04.910 --> 06:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
community power aggregations um and
 
06:42:09.830 --> 06:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
affirming the original 1996 act uh
 
06:42:12.548 --> 06:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
finding um since the coalition's
 
06:42:15.430 --> 06:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
establishment in October 2021 we've
 
06:42:17.510 --> 06:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
sought to ensure Equitable treatment of
 
06:42:19.310 --> 06:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
customers whether they are on
 
06:42:21.548 --> 06:42:21.558 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply Community power
 
06:42:24.070 --> 06:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
aggregation service or utility default
 
06:42:26.590 --> 06:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
service in order to maximize economic
 
06:42:29.030 --> 06:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
efficiency through competitive markets
 
06:42:31.230 --> 06:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
and realize an affordable Equitable and
 
06:42:33.910 --> 06:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
sustainable future for all Granite
 
06:42:37.030 --> 06:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
Staters um and just to add a bit more in
 
06:42:40.788 --> 06:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
the first five months of cbc's operation
 
06:42:43.270 --> 06:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
we've saved we've saved CPA member
 
06:42:46.150 --> 06:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
customers about $7 million compared to
 
06:42:48.590 --> 06:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
utility default service um and we've
 
06:42:51.628 --> 06:42:51.638 align:start position:0%
accured about $5 million in joint Reser
 
06:42:54.468 --> 06:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
joint Financial Reserves um just last
 
06:42:57.868 --> 06:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
week we announced a rate decrease to 8.1
 
06:43:00.510 --> 06:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
cents um and that's for the rate period
 
06:43:02.990 --> 06:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
beginning February 1st through July of
 
06:43:05.948 --> 06:43:05.958 align:start position:0%
this year for our Granite Granite basic
 
06:43:09.388 --> 06:43:09.398 align:start position:0%
service um and our price has beat all of
 
06:43:12.270 --> 06:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
the electric utilities including the
 
06:43:14.910 --> 06:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
co-op um and included with our testimony
 
06:43:17.388 --> 06:43:17.398 align:start position:0%
is a handout that Clifton raised um that
 
06:43:19.670 --> 06:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
overviews these rates as well as our
 
06:43:21.670 --> 06:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
current membership thank you for the
 
06:43:21.680 --> 06:43:22.670 align:start position:0%
current membership thank you for the
committee's

06:43:22.670 --> 06:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
06:43:27.110 --> 06:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
time thank you um and to explain why we
 
06:43:30.270 --> 06:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
oppose this as introduced um I I I will
 
06:43:33.388 --> 06:43:33.398 align:start position:0%
say I appreciate the uh uh desire for
 
06:43:35.868 --> 06:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
transparency but um there I think
 
06:43:37.830 --> 06:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
there's some unintended consequences
 
06:43:40.788 --> 06:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
here that you need to Grapple with um we
 
06:43:42.510 --> 06:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill is
 
06:43:45.030 --> 06:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive and would foreclose the
 
06:43:47.868 --> 06:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
ability of community power aggregations
 
06:43:49.910 --> 06:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
and competitive electric power suppliers
 
06:43:52.590 --> 06:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
known as seps uh to serve net metered
 
06:43:55.388 --> 06:43:55.398 align:start position:0%
customers it effectively would reverse
 
06:43:59.270 --> 06:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
28 years of uh State policy to move away
 
06:44:02.030 --> 06:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
from a monopoly uh with regard to power
 
06:44:05.270 --> 06:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
supply and um eliminate customer choice
 
06:44:08.510 --> 06:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
for those who net metered um I'm sure
 
06:44:10.910 --> 06:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's not the intent of the sponsors uh
 
06:44:13.708 --> 06:44:13.718 align:start position:0%
uh but but and if that's the case and
 
06:44:16.310 --> 06:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
this bill moves forward uh then it
 
06:44:19.110 --> 06:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
should be amended to allow costs paid to
 
06:44:23.750 --> 06:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
net metered customers by com by CPA uh
 
06:44:26.388 --> 06:44:26.398 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregations and seps to
 
06:44:28.510 --> 06:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
also be recovered through the stranded
 
06:44:30.868 --> 06:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
cost recovery charge after all our rates
 
06:44:33.430 --> 06:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
are lower so the charges uh to that
 
06:44:37.750 --> 06:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
would be lower however um the way it is
 
06:44:39.910 --> 06:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
now we cannot effectively serve net
 
06:44:43.670 --> 06:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
metered customers and that's because
 
06:44:47.190 --> 06:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
um uh in effect uh what this bill does
 
06:44:49.788 --> 06:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
is require the socialization of all cost
 
06:44:52.628 --> 06:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
of net metering um incurred by the
 
06:44:56.190 --> 06:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
utilities without accounting for uh any
 
06:44:59.150 --> 06:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
of the benefits or without accounting
 
06:45:01.270 --> 06:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
for most of the benefits or attempting
 
06:45:04.430 --> 06:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
to pair cost and benefits it moves us
 
06:45:06.548 --> 06:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
away from market-based Price signals for
 
06:45:09.750 --> 06:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
net metering um the specific problem in
 
06:45:11.750 --> 06:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
terms of locking in this form accounting
 
06:45:14.750 --> 06:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
and cost recovery um is that it
 
06:45:16.510 --> 06:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
effectively forecloses the
 
06:45:19.190 --> 06:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
implementation of RSA
 
06:45:23.468 --> 06:45:23.478 align:start position:0%
362a colon 9 Roman 2 that provides for
 
06:45:26.628 --> 06:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
for competitive suppliers and CPAs to
 
06:45:28.510 --> 06:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
determine their own terms and conditions
 
06:45:31.270 --> 06:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
for net metering and goes on to say and
 
06:45:33.190 --> 06:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
this is highlighted at the ba bottom of
 
06:45:38.190 --> 06:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
page two um such output uh by net meter
 
06:45:41.070 --> 06:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
customers um that are being served by a
 
06:45:43.350 --> 06:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
by a competitive supplier or an
 
06:45:46.430 --> 06:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
aggregation shall be accounted for as a
 
06:45:48.990 --> 06:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
reduction to the customer generators
 
06:45:52.070 --> 06:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
suppliers wholesale load obligation for
 
06:45:55.310 --> 06:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
energy Supply net of any applicable line
 
06:45:57.468 --> 06:45:57.478 align:start position:0%
losses adjustments as approved by the
 
06:45:59.150 --> 06:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
commission now the commission hasn't
 
06:46:01.270 --> 06:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
done that so this requirement has not
 
06:46:03.510 --> 06:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
kicked in yet we're preparing a petition
 
06:46:06.190 --> 06:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
to ask the commission uh to make such a
 
06:46:08.310 --> 06:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
determination and and and to direct the
 
06:46:10.868 --> 06:46:10.878 align:start position:0%
utilities to move forward with this form
 
06:46:14.350 --> 06:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
of accounting now why is that important
 
06:46:16.788 --> 06:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
um and I might add that this notion that
 
06:46:18.190 --> 06:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers should be able to
 
06:46:20.110 --> 06:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
determine their own terms and conditions
 
06:46:21.750 --> 06:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
for net meter customers and to be able
 
06:46:24.190 --> 06:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
to serve them has been part part of the
 
06:46:26.510 --> 06:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
net metering law since it was first
 
06:46:27.910 --> 06:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
enacted in
 
06:46:33.030 --> 06:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
1998 so you know we're 26 years out um
 
06:46:36.670 --> 06:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh and in spite of that the utilities
 
06:46:39.430 --> 06:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
have not prepared to enable that they've
 
06:46:42.388 --> 06:46:42.398 align:start position:0%
not acted to enable that and uh with
 
06:46:44.708 --> 06:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
regard to that new Pro that provision on
 
06:46:46.110 --> 06:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
um how they should account for load
 
06:46:49.708 --> 06:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
settlement um they is also echoed in the
 
06:46:51.868 --> 06:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
pu's rules for Community power
 
06:46:54.990 --> 06:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
aggregation um they have not prepared to
 
06:46:58.430 --> 06:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
implement it um uh even more
 
06:47:01.388 --> 06:47:01.398 align:start position:0%
recently um Counting exports to the grid
 
06:47:03.708 --> 06:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
by net meter customers as an offset to
 
06:47:06.270 --> 06:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
the power that is otherwise purchased
 
06:47:08.670 --> 06:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
from ISO New England is essential to any
 
06:47:10.670 --> 06:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
Market design that wants to enable
 
06:47:14.190 --> 06:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers CPAs or seps to
 
06:47:16.788 --> 06:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
serve net metered customers um and to
 
06:47:19.110 --> 06:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
account for actual benefits along with
 
06:47:22.270 --> 06:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
the actual cost um if we don't account
 
06:47:24.788 --> 06:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
for those benefit benefits uh that these
 
06:47:27.230 --> 06:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
resources produce
 
06:47:30.868 --> 06:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
um which includes a reduction for for
 
06:47:33.708 --> 06:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier such as a CPA uh
 
06:47:35.830 --> 06:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
includes a reduction to what would
 
06:47:38.190 --> 06:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise have to be supplied from the
 
06:47:40.548 --> 06:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
regional grid and the corresponding
 
06:47:43.230 --> 06:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
energy and solary service and uh
 
06:47:46.708 --> 06:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
generation capacity cost um if if we
 
06:47:48.788 --> 06:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
don't get credit for those exports to
 
06:47:50.628 --> 06:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
the grid then we can't afford to
 
06:47:52.868 --> 06:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
compensate customers we don't have
 
06:47:55.388 --> 06:47:55.398 align:start position:0%
access to the mechanism where we say we
 
06:47:58.708 --> 06:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
can just charge this to all other C all
 
06:48:00.868 --> 06:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
customers whether there are customers or
 
06:48:03.708 --> 06:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
not um we would have to any compensation
 
06:48:05.910 --> 06:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
we paid without getting any credit for
 
06:48:08.548 --> 06:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
those exports um would have to be
 
06:48:11.230 --> 06:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
subsidized by other customers and are
 
06:48:13.270 --> 06:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know we can't do that and and be
 
06:48:15.230 --> 06:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
fair and Equitable to all of our
 
06:48:18.388 --> 06:48:18.398 align:start position:0%
customers um on the other hand uh when
 
06:48:20.270 --> 06:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
utility load settlement systems are
 
06:48:22.070 --> 06:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
changed to account for exports to the
 
06:48:23.628 --> 06:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
grid by net metered customer customers
 
06:48:26.468 --> 06:48:26.478 align:start position:0%
of of competitive suppliers uh then
 
06:48:28.948 --> 06:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
enactment of this bill as introduced
 
06:48:31.388 --> 06:48:31.398 align:start position:0%
would create a windfall for the utility
 
06:48:34.990 --> 06:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
default service customers by requiring
 
06:48:38.468 --> 06:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
our customers to subsidize the utility
 
06:48:41.110 --> 06:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
default service customers creating undue
 
06:48:42.990 --> 06:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
cost shifting and a competitive
 
06:48:46.110 --> 06:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
disadvantage for any Supply alternative
 
06:48:49.868 --> 06:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
to utility default Energy service and
 
06:48:53.270 --> 06:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
you might say well H why is that I I
 
06:48:55.788 --> 06:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
deta detail example and I'll just sort
 
06:49:00.030 --> 06:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
of outline it here um if you took for a
 
06:49:04.270 --> 06:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
given hour for instance um uh for a A
 
06:49:07.948 --> 06:49:07.958 align:start position:0%
supplier or which could be a CPA or the
 
06:49:10.788 --> 06:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
utility default service if their group
 
06:49:13.070 --> 06:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
of customers were to consume a th000
 
06:49:16.388 --> 06:49:16.398 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours during that uh hour and
 
06:49:18.110 --> 06:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
they had net metered customers who
 
06:49:21.948 --> 06:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
exported 100 megawatt hours to the grid
 
06:49:24.750 --> 06:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
um uh this then the effect on the
 
06:49:27.110 --> 06:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
regional transmission grid where there
 
06:49:30.270 --> 06:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
is a meter would see that there's nine
 
06:49:32.030 --> 06:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
that there's only they're only supplying
 
06:49:35.708 --> 06:49:35.718 align:start position:0%
900 megawatt hours from the iso New
 
06:49:38.590 --> 06:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
England bulk Market uh to the
 
06:49:41.350 --> 06:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
distribution system
 
06:49:45.110 --> 06:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
um however under the current uh utility
 
06:49:45.120 --> 06:49:45.990 align:start position:0%
um however under the current uh utility
uh

06:49:45.990 --> 06:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:49:48.110 --> 06:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
processes um oops I turned in the wrong
 
06:49:51.868 --> 06:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
direction um uh they don't account for
 
06:49:53.750 --> 06:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
those exports to the grid
 
06:49:56.110 --> 06:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
um they treat they convert you know it's
 
06:49:59.030 --> 06:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
a two channel meter measures uh movement
 
06:50:01.350 --> 06:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
of energy in both directions when they
 
06:50:03.430 --> 06:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
see exports to the grid that channel
 
06:50:05.190 --> 06:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
they take and convert all those exports
 
06:50:07.510 --> 06:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
to the grid to zero and that's actually
 
06:50:08.990 --> 06:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
the number they give us they say all
 
06:50:10.990 --> 06:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
you're if we've had some net meter
 
06:50:13.110 --> 06:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
customers who signed up we've tried to
 
06:50:14.510 --> 06:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
avoid enrolling them because we have to
 
06:50:16.868 --> 06:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
warn them we can't compensate them uh
 
06:50:18.788 --> 06:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
but where they have shown up they show
 
06:50:21.868 --> 06:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
up as zeros when they export to the grid
 
06:50:23.670 --> 06:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
um and and they don't account for that
 
06:50:25.868 --> 06:50:25.878 align:start position:0%
as an offset to the power we otherwise
 
06:50:29.628 --> 06:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
have to provide so so for the past 25 28
 
06:50:32.070 --> 06:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
years um competitive suppliers have
 
06:50:34.590 --> 06:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
simply not tried to serve net metered
 
06:50:36.830 --> 06:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
customers um because they have to tell
 
06:50:38.110 --> 06:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
them we can't give you any credit
 
06:50:39.468 --> 06:50:39.478 align:start position:0%
because we don't get any credit from the
 
06:50:42.388 --> 06:50:42.398 align:start position:0%
utility um we still have to buy all the
 
06:50:44.628 --> 06:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours we deliver no credit for
 
06:50:49.510 --> 06:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
the exports to the grid um but if if if
 
06:50:51.910 --> 06:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
the statute that says you shall account
 
06:50:55.388 --> 06:50:55.398 align:start position:0%
for it this way uh for us um is
 
06:50:56.948 --> 06:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
implemented fir first of all the
 
06:50:59.030 --> 06:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
utilities eversource at least is said
 
06:51:01.590 --> 06:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
that cannot be done unless it's done for
 
06:51:03.670 --> 06:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
all suppliers we can't do it for
 
06:51:06.230 --> 06:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers and CPAs and use
 
06:51:08.030 --> 06:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
exports to the grid to offset what you
 
06:51:10.150 --> 06:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
have to buy unless we also do that for
 
06:51:12.788 --> 06:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
default service um and if they did it
 
06:51:14.948 --> 06:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
for default service um that would be
 
06:51:17.548 --> 06:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
great so in that case there's we'd only
 
06:51:20.190 --> 06:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
have to buy 900 kilowatt hourss uh from
 
06:51:22.388 --> 06:51:22.398 align:start position:0%
ISO New England and we could afford to
 
06:51:24.708 --> 06:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
compensate the other 100 kilowatt hours
 
06:51:26.110 --> 06:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
or megawatt hours that we get from net
 
06:51:28.070 --> 06:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
meter customers because we're actually
 
06:51:30.948 --> 06:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
selling a th the same thing for utility
 
06:51:35.788 --> 06:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
default service um uh if if the utility
 
06:51:38.990 --> 06:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
default service um was only had to buy
 
06:51:42.510 --> 06:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
900 but they were selling a th000 uh but
 
06:51:45.430 --> 06:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
the cost to compensate for that 100
 
06:51:46.910 --> 06:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours from net metered
 
06:51:49.708 --> 06:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
customers is shifted out of default
 
06:51:52.388 --> 06:51:52.398 align:start position:0%
Service uh then then you've created a
 
06:51:55.110 --> 06:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
situation where the cost to serve them
 
06:51:58.510 --> 06:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
beyond the actual cost has gone down and
 
06:52:00.230 --> 06:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
those costs are being recovered from all
 
06:52:03.110 --> 06:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
rate payers so our rate payers would be
 
06:52:05.628 --> 06:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
subsidizing a discount on the utility
 
06:52:08.190 --> 06:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
default service rate because you're only
 
06:52:10.030 --> 06:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
accounting for the purchase of 900
 
06:52:13.590 --> 06:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours instead of a th000 um and
 
06:52:15.510 --> 06:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that would uh tilt the overall
 
06:52:17.750 --> 06:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
competitive market to favor utility
 
06:52:19.788 --> 06:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
default service over any other option
 
06:52:21.670 --> 06:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
and could destroy competitive
 
06:52:23.750 --> 06:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
electricity Supply supp Market in New
 
06:52:26.468 --> 06:52:26.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alternatively you know more
 
06:52:29.628 --> 06:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
likely to happen is we would just CPAs
 
06:52:32.388 --> 06:52:32.398 align:start position:0%
and seps would just say we cannot
 
06:52:37.110 --> 06:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
compensate you even um at all uh so they
 
06:52:39.468 --> 06:52:39.478 align:start position:0%
would stay on utility default service um
 
06:52:41.310 --> 06:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
which would result in a destruction of
 
06:52:43.628 --> 06:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
customer choice for customers who net
 
06:52:46.270 --> 06:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
Meer or want to and that's a significant
 
06:52:49.830 --> 06:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
number of customers we have had uh uh
 
06:52:52.468 --> 06:52:52.478 align:start position:0%
there are hundreds of uh customers
 
06:52:54.548 --> 06:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
Within the just the 14 communities where
 
06:52:56.750 --> 06:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
we've launched that net meter who want
 
06:53:00.070 --> 06:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
to be on community power supply um but
 
06:53:02.548 --> 06:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
we have to tell them we can't serve them
 
06:53:04.830 --> 06:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
at this point in time until we fix these
 
06:53:09.110 --> 06:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
problems um uh just you know to move on
 
06:53:12.150 --> 06:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
um as previously stated this seems to be
 
06:53:14.310 --> 06:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
a solution in search of a problem all
 
06:53:15.948 --> 06:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
this is already enabled in current
 
06:53:19.788 --> 06:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
statute the puc's considering um some of
 
06:53:22.310 --> 06:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
the very same issues that this provokes
 
06:53:24.990 --> 06:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
in their current net metering proceeding
 
06:53:27.150 --> 06:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
and and just as an example we filed
 
06:53:29.788 --> 06:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
testimony in that uh proceeding to
 
06:53:31.750 --> 06:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
suggest that going forward or or to
 
06:53:34.190 --> 06:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
recommend that going forward new net
 
06:53:36.868 --> 06:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
metered customers after September 1st of
 
06:53:39.430 --> 06:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
this year should be compensated at less
 
06:53:42.270 --> 06:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
than the full defa default service rate
 
06:53:44.190 --> 06:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
they should be compensated in a manner
 
06:53:47.350 --> 06:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
that is comparable to what is being paid
 
06:53:49.868 --> 06:53:49.878 align:start position:0%
to the to the supplier of default
 
06:53:53.030 --> 06:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
service so when you in that way wouldn't
 
06:53:54.948 --> 06:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
be any cost that you have to shift into
 
06:53:57.150 --> 06:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
stranded cost recovery because you would
 
06:53:59.910 --> 06:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
just be compensating the net meter
 
06:54:02.590 --> 06:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
generation for the cost that it's
 
06:54:04.830 --> 06:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
actually avoiding you you're only
 
06:54:07.270 --> 06:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
needing 900 megawatt hours from the from
 
06:54:09.350 --> 06:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
the supplier rather than a thousand
 
06:54:12.150 --> 06:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
because you're getting a 100 from net
 
06:54:12.160 --> 06:54:14.110 align:start position:0%
because you're getting a 100 from net
metering

06:54:14.110 --> 06:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
metering
 
06:54:17.990 --> 06:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
um so that that that is sort of a
 
06:54:22.310 --> 06:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
concept going forward um and we propose
 
06:54:22.320 --> 06:54:23.310 align:start position:0%
concept going forward um and we propose
that

06:54:23.310 --> 06:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:54:26.310 --> 06:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh if you can reduce this to your actual
 
06:54:29.788 --> 06:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
avoided cost um and the Delta is
 
06:54:31.910 --> 06:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
primarily cost not related to the supply
 
06:54:33.948 --> 06:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
of power it's related to the consumption
 
06:54:36.430 --> 06:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
of power like RPS compliance costs the
 
06:54:38.150 --> 06:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
cost to administer default service
 
06:54:40.628 --> 06:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
working capital for default service um
 
06:54:42.430 --> 06:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
if you exclude those from the
 
06:54:45.990 --> 06:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
compensation uh then um uh not only have
 
06:54:48.990 --> 06:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
you sort of reduce that mismatch between
 
06:54:52.310 --> 06:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh cost and benefit in in this category
 
06:54:56.430 --> 06:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
uh but you've also um uh what you could
 
06:54:58.990 --> 06:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
do is take any excess such costs such
 
06:55:01.150 --> 06:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
from existing net meter customers and
 
06:55:02.750 --> 06:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
recover that that would be appropriate
 
06:55:04.110 --> 06:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
to put in the strained cost recovery
 
06:55:06.910 --> 06:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
charge because it's cost and excessive
 
06:55:10.708 --> 06:55:10.718 align:start position:0%
benefits um it would also undermine the
 
06:55:13.190 --> 06:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
utility obligation that currently exists
 
06:55:16.310 --> 06:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
in the language around uh stranded costs
 
06:55:19.430 --> 06:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
that says utilities have have had and
 
06:55:21.430 --> 06:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
continue to have an obligation to take
 
06:55:23.150 --> 06:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
all reasonable measures to mitigate
 
06:55:25.310 --> 06:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
stranded cost you might as well repeal
 
06:55:26.910 --> 06:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
that if you're going to pass this as
 
06:55:29.750 --> 06:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
introduced because in effect the best
 
06:55:31.510 --> 06:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
way for utilities to mitigate these
 
06:55:33.948 --> 06:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
costs is to let enable us and
 
06:55:35.910 --> 06:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers to serve nit
 
06:55:37.990 --> 06:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
metered customers then they become our
 
06:55:39.270 --> 06:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
customers and they're not com
 
06:55:41.830 --> 06:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
compensating them for the energy value
 
06:55:43.310 --> 06:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
they're output to the grid and you've
 
06:55:45.468 --> 06:55:45.478 align:start position:0%
just taken that whole cost out of out of
 
06:55:48.510 --> 06:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
the equation for stranded costs um the
 
06:55:50.468 --> 06:55:50.478 align:start position:0%
law also says stranded costs should be
 
06:55:52.708 --> 06:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
determined on a net basis that's not
 
06:55:55.910 --> 06:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does it's all cost no
 
06:55:58.830 --> 06:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
transparency or counting for benefits
 
06:56:00.110 --> 06:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
and they should be consistent with
 
06:56:02.468 --> 06:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
promotion of a fully compe competitive
 
06:56:05.310 --> 06:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
market which this kind of goes in the
 
06:56:06.788 --> 06:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
opposite direction we're moving away
 
06:56:08.990 --> 06:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
from competitive markets and saying
 
06:56:13.510 --> 06:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to lock into law um that all
 
06:56:15.868 --> 06:56:15.878 align:start position:0%
the costs for net metering are at least
 
06:56:18.230 --> 06:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
for utilities is socialized all the
 
06:56:19.628 --> 06:56:19.638 align:start position:0%
benefits are
 
06:56:22.350 --> 06:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
socialized and in effect it's going to
 
06:56:23.628 --> 06:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
be be a monopoly function of the
 
06:56:23.638 --> 06:56:24.788 align:start position:0%
be be a monopoly function of the
distribution

06:56:24.788 --> 06:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
06:56:29.110 --> 06:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
utility um finally I want to reiterate
 
06:56:31.990 --> 06:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
that 25 28 years of New Hampshire policy
 
06:56:34.030 --> 06:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
development has been to try to steer us
 
06:56:35.750 --> 06:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
towards more competitive markets
 
06:56:38.430 --> 06:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
economic efficiency Innovation and
 
06:56:40.868 --> 06:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
customer choice and electricity Supply
 
06:56:42.708 --> 06:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
that would all be undermined or
 
06:56:45.190 --> 06:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
nullified by the enactment of this bill
 
06:56:47.230 --> 06:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
as introduced and and there's various
 
06:56:49.070 --> 06:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
quotations there towards the bottom of
 
06:56:52.510 --> 06:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
page five and page six and of course you
 
06:56:54.510 --> 06:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
know it's it's sort of antithetical to
 
06:56:56.628 --> 06:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
our constitution our very constitution
 
06:56:58.310 --> 06:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the state that calls for free and
 
06:57:00.468 --> 06:57:00.478 align:start position:0%
compet Fair competition in the trades
 
06:57:02.510 --> 06:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
and Industry as an inherent and
 
06:57:04.670 --> 06:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
essential right of the people that
 
06:57:06.830 --> 06:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
should be protected against all
 
06:57:10.270 --> 06:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
monopolies what this bill if does is
 
06:57:12.350 --> 06:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
memorialize and
 
06:57:14.548 --> 06:57:14.558 align:start position:0%
institutionalize net metering as a
 
06:57:17.910 --> 06:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
monopoly for the distribution utility I
 
06:57:19.230 --> 06:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that's the direction we
 
06:57:21.110 --> 06:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
should be going in so you should just be
 
06:57:23.030 --> 06:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
aware that you're kind of undo doing a
 
06:57:24.990 --> 06:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
policy Direction now I'll admit we
 
06:57:27.670 --> 06:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
haven't really realized the the the the
 
06:57:29.388 --> 06:57:29.398 align:start position:0%
appropriate me you know fully
 
06:57:32.750 --> 06:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh uh way to compensate nit
 
06:57:35.830 --> 06:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
metering or to enable you know others to
 
06:57:37.750 --> 06:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
serve uh but we're trying to move in
 
06:57:39.150 --> 06:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
that direction particularly in the
 
06:57:41.510 --> 06:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
current net metering proceeding so I
 
06:57:43.310 --> 06:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
just you know ask that you let that play
 
06:57:47.868 --> 06:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
out um we we we've put an inor inornate
 
06:57:50.190 --> 06:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
amount of effort to try to resolve this
 
06:57:53.948 --> 06:57:53.958 align:start position:0%
issue because um uh
 
06:57:57.030 --> 06:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
anybody it is the single biggest issue
 
06:57:58.868 --> 06:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
that our local communities are getting
 
06:58:01.548 --> 06:58:01.558 align:start position:0%
feedback in in the public hearings on
 
06:58:04.230 --> 06:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
net me on on U launching Community power
 
06:58:06.590 --> 06:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
aggregation which is are you going to be
 
06:58:08.948 --> 06:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
able to serve net metered customers and
 
06:58:11.190 --> 06:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
and the answers we intended to the law
 
06:58:12.948 --> 06:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
actually says we have to explain how
 
06:58:14.110 --> 06:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to serve net metered
 
06:58:16.548 --> 06:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
customers in our aggregation plans that
 
06:58:18.190 --> 06:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
have to be perceived by approved by the
 
06:58:20.788 --> 06:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
Pu but they all assume number one the
 
06:58:23.030 --> 06:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
utilities are going to give us the data
 
06:58:25.548 --> 06:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
um and number two that they're going to
 
06:58:27.430 --> 06:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
account for these exports to the grid as
 
06:58:29.388 --> 06:58:29.398 align:start position:0%
an offset to the power we otherwise have
 
06:58:32.948 --> 06:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
to procure so the final thing I want to
 
06:58:35.628 --> 06:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
say is that this notion that it's the
 
06:58:36.910 --> 06:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
that we're not accounting for the
 
06:58:39.948 --> 06:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
benefits is literally true in the net
 
06:58:41.868 --> 06:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
metering proceeding I thought a fairly
 
06:58:44.350 --> 06:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
simple Discovery question that I that we
 
06:58:46.990 --> 06:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
needed to know for our testimony and to
 
06:58:50.548 --> 06:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
calculate benefits is how many kilowatt
 
06:58:52.628 --> 06:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
hours are exported to the grid by net
 
06:58:55.388 --> 06:58:55.398 align:start position:0%
metered customers and none of the
 
06:58:57.030 --> 06:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
utilities could tell us they could tell
 
06:58:59.230 --> 06:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
us we can tell you how much we paid them
 
06:59:01.270 --> 06:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
but we can't tell you how many kilowatt
 
06:59:03.628 --> 06:59:03.638 align:start position:0%
hours they exported to the
 
06:59:07.030 --> 06:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
grid and and and and and and as we've
 
06:59:09.388 --> 06:59:09.398 align:start position:0%
gotten to the load discussion discussion
 
06:59:11.510 --> 06:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
discussion we've also discovered they
 
06:59:15.628 --> 06:59:15.638 align:start position:0%
have no analytics whatsoever on how net
 
06:59:18.190 --> 06:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
metering affects load shapes so if a
 
06:59:20.150 --> 06:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
customer shows up and they're only
 
06:59:23.150 --> 06:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
showing five kilowatt hours um and and
 
06:59:24.910 --> 06:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
we know that they're showing that for
 
06:59:26.670 --> 06:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
the whole month because most of it was
 
06:59:29.750 --> 06:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
offset by net metering they just assume
 
06:59:32.310 --> 06:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
that any offset was over all hours of
 
06:59:35.110 --> 06:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
the day 247 and just pushes down their
 
06:59:39.030 --> 06:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
whole load shape for the entire uh uh
 
06:59:42.150 --> 06:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
month um based on class average load
 
06:59:45.670 --> 06:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
shape um which is obviously not true um
 
06:59:47.948 --> 06:59:47.958 align:start position:0%
so so you know that's part of the
 
06:59:51.310 --> 06:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
problem and and I think a number of
 
06:59:53.548 --> 06:59:53.558 align:start position:0%
parties in this we're really surprised
 
06:59:55.388 --> 06:59:55.398 align:start position:0%
that they've made no attempt uh to
 
06:59:58.230 --> 06:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
analyze uh the impact of net metering
 
07:00:01.670 --> 07:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
and so you might say well um does this
 
07:00:04.830 --> 07:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
you know how is this benefit that is
 
07:00:08.990 --> 07:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
real um occur and it's because um I I
 
07:00:12.388 --> 07:00:12.398 align:start position:0%
think Mike Lata explained a bit of it um
 
07:00:15.910 --> 07:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
it actually does reduce except for the
 
07:00:18.548 --> 07:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
approximately 100 systems that sell that
 
07:00:20.150 --> 07:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
they resell the power into the iso
 
07:00:22.110 --> 07:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
England market for all the other
 
07:00:23.708 --> 07:00:23.718 align:start position:0%
thousands literally thousands I forget
 
07:00:25.150 --> 07:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
the total number but it's thousands of
 
07:00:27.910 --> 07:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
netmed customers in New Hampshire um
 
07:00:30.230 --> 07:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
they all function as load reducers so
 
07:00:32.708 --> 07:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
they reduce the amount of power we're
 
07:00:35.070 --> 07:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
buying from ISO New England and they
 
07:00:37.548 --> 07:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
reduce um if they produce at monthly
 
07:00:40.548 --> 07:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
coincident Peaks they reduce um our
 
07:00:42.388 --> 07:00:42.398 align:start position:0%
transmission charges and and they do
 
07:00:44.670 --> 07:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
that PV does it for at least five months
 
07:00:47.350 --> 07:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
of the year there's the coincident Peaks
 
07:00:50.310 --> 07:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
are uh daylight hours and and as
 
07:00:52.388 --> 07:00:52.398 align:start position:0%
referenced ISO New England has studed
 
07:00:54.628 --> 07:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
this um because they got access to tens
 
07:00:57.350 --> 07:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
of thousands of um net meter data
 
07:00:59.670 --> 07:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
including on a state specific data basis
 
07:01:01.468 --> 07:01:01.478 align:start position:0%
which we suggested maybe we could use
 
07:01:03.070 --> 07:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
that to try to understand how this
 
07:01:05.830 --> 07:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
impacts uh load shapes but instead that
 
07:01:10.548 --> 07:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't occur and and the they treat it
 
07:01:12.708 --> 07:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
as literally unaccounted for energy
 
07:01:15.990 --> 07:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
along with some other stuff um uh that's
 
07:01:18.070 --> 07:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
not accounted for uh because it's
 
07:01:21.270 --> 07:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to do and and and it gets
 
07:01:24.150 --> 07:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
buried in some something called the
 
07:01:27.070 --> 07:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
residual that is not a published number
 
07:01:30.750 --> 07:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
it's unknown to anybody basically
 
07:01:33.388 --> 07:01:33.398 align:start position:0%
because it's figured for every hour um
 
07:01:36.110 --> 07:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
of the year there's a residual which is
 
07:01:38.510 --> 07:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
the fudge factor to try to make retail
 
07:01:41.150 --> 07:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
loads match up with what is actually
 
07:01:42.990 --> 07:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
measured coming off the transmission
 
07:01:47.590 --> 07:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
grid um and we did ask a question in
 
07:01:49.350 --> 07:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
Discovery and we learned something they
 
07:01:51.230 --> 07:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
publish line losses and they say oh
 
07:01:54.430 --> 07:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
they're around 7% % so if you figure if
 
07:01:56.190 --> 07:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
you're a supplier and you have retail
 
07:01:57.670 --> 07:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
load figure that's going to have to be
 
07:02:00.628 --> 07:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
grossed up by 7% because if you if your
 
07:02:03.190 --> 07:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
customer consumes 100 kilowatt hours uh
 
07:02:05.510 --> 07:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
you need to actually buy about 107 from
 
07:02:07.990 --> 07:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
the iso New England Market uh uh because
 
07:02:11.468 --> 07:02:11.478 align:start position:0%
of line losses along the way and um we
 
07:02:13.788 --> 07:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
said well what what is the actual eff of
 
07:02:17.190 --> 07:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
um uh uh settlement and eversource and
 
07:02:18.750 --> 07:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh Unitil came back and said well
 
07:02:20.590 --> 07:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
actually for last year it was only about
 
07:02:22.788 --> 07:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
4.4% um and that's that's the first time
 
07:02:24.830 --> 07:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
I think that number's ever been public
 
07:02:27.430 --> 07:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
um and so what that Delta some chunk of
 
07:02:31.350 --> 07:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
it is uh and that's 247 some chunk of
 
07:02:33.548 --> 07:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
that Delta between 4.4 and what's
 
07:02:35.548 --> 07:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
probably the real line losses is this
 
07:02:37.948 --> 07:02:37.958 align:start position:0%
unaccounted for energy but they can't
 
07:02:41.388 --> 07:02:41.398 align:start position:0%
break it out so that's that's the issue
 
07:02:43.670 --> 07:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh so we would uh hope that you would uh
 
07:02:46.110 --> 07:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh uh hold on to this bill for
 
07:02:49.150 --> 07:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
interm study or considering amending it
 
07:02:52.230 --> 07:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh so it allows us uh to also socialize
 
07:02:53.430 --> 07:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
our cost if we're going to stick with
 
07:02:56.990 --> 07:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
socializing all the benefits or limit um
 
07:02:58.750 --> 07:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
this requirement to only those costs
 
07:03:01.468 --> 07:03:01.478 align:start position:0%
that are in excess of uh uh benefits
 
07:03:05.350 --> 07:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Bao I I do have a
 
07:03:07.830 --> 07:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
question but before I ask the question
 
07:03:11.708 --> 07:03:11.718 align:start position:0%
um uh my only comment is had you been
 
07:03:14.670 --> 07:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
reading your testimony I'm not sure we
 
07:03:17.590 --> 07:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
would have been able to see you
 
07:03:19.990 --> 07:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh not sure how high that stack might
 
07:03:22.750 --> 07:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
have been on the well is it's all right
 
07:03:25.110 --> 07:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
here on my testimony the net metering
 
07:03:26.788 --> 07:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
proceeding that might be true that that
 
07:03:29.350 --> 07:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
was about 40 pages long um so I'll take
 
07:03:32.388 --> 07:03:32.398 align:start position:0%
the liberty of asking a question so how
 
07:03:35.990 --> 07:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that transparency is um
 
07:03:37.388 --> 07:03:37.398 align:start position:0%
You didn't say quote wonderful thing but
 
07:03:40.750 --> 07:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
it is a wonderful thing um how would you
 
07:03:43.510 --> 07:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
approach net metering to become more
 
07:03:47.708 --> 07:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
transparent um in in a
 
07:03:51.830 --> 07:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
nutshell um I I guess from a legislative
 
07:03:55.510 --> 07:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
point of view you you you could ask for
 
07:03:56.750 --> 07:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
because they do a lot of things on an
 
07:03:59.670 --> 07:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
annual basis the these reconciliations
 
07:04:01.788 --> 07:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
strand cost recovery reconciliation all
 
07:04:04.430 --> 07:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
that is is done on an annual basis is
 
07:04:06.910 --> 07:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
you could ask in conjunction with that
 
07:04:09.150 --> 07:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
that the utilities report and publish on
 
07:04:12.110 --> 07:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
their website um what the costs incurred
 
07:04:14.510 --> 07:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
were uh but also they should try to
 
07:04:16.388 --> 07:04:16.398 align:start position:0%
estimate what the benefits are you know
 
07:04:17.948 --> 07:04:17.958 align:start position:0%
they they should add up those kilowatt
 
07:04:19.388 --> 07:04:19.398 align:start position:0%
hours that are exported to the grid and
 
07:04:21.548 --> 07:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
figure out how much uh that translates
 
07:04:23.190 --> 07:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
into to in terms of power that's not
 
07:04:24.868 --> 07:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
being purchased from ISO New England
 
07:04:27.750 --> 07:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's buried in this residual number um
 
07:04:30.388 --> 07:04:30.398 align:start position:0%
they should using the best available
 
07:04:32.270 --> 07:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
data which I I would suggest ISO New
 
07:04:34.310 --> 07:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
England has a pretty robust effort to
 
07:04:36.708 --> 07:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
try to quantify uh the what the effect
 
07:04:39.430 --> 07:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
of behind the meter generation is um
 
07:04:43.110 --> 07:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
having obtained access to thousands of
 
07:04:45.510 --> 07:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
um data points from net metered systems
 
07:04:47.548 --> 07:04:47.558 align:start position:0%
and they and they actually calculate on
 
07:04:49.830 --> 07:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
a state specific basis the utilities
 
07:04:52.110 --> 07:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
could use or Department of energy use
 
07:04:55.910 --> 07:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
that data to estimate based on uh the
 
07:04:57.468 --> 07:04:57.478 align:start position:0%
production in New Hampshire or the
 
07:05:00.190 --> 07:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
specific New Hampshire uh analysis that
 
07:05:03.150 --> 07:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
ISO New England does how much of that
 
07:05:05.670 --> 07:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
power is reducing our coincident Peak
 
07:05:07.708 --> 07:05:07.718 align:start position:0%
demand and consequently transmission
 
07:05:10.990 --> 07:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
cost um and how much of it is being used
 
07:05:12.788 --> 07:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
uh how much occurs at the annual
 
07:05:14.830 --> 07:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
coincident Peak which you know
 
07:05:16.628 --> 07:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
historically is always been a summertime
 
07:05:18.990 --> 07:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
daylight hour you know it's late in the
 
07:05:21.190 --> 07:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon on hot days typically hot
 
07:05:21.200 --> 07:05:22.388 align:start position:0%
afternoon on hot days typically hot
weekday

07:05:22.388 --> 07:05:22.398 align:start position:0%
weekday
 
07:05:24.670 --> 07:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
um and ISO New England has estimated
 
07:05:28.070 --> 07:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
that four states specifically that could
 
07:05:30.070 --> 07:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
be published so that you actually have a
 
07:05:32.350 --> 07:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
published report on what are the costs
 
07:05:34.708 --> 07:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
and what are the benefits that that can
 
07:05:37.310 --> 07:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
be Quantified thank you I will I will
 
07:05:40.590 --> 07:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
approve my own follow-up question um do
 
07:05:43.350 --> 07:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
you do you believe that they could do
 
07:05:48.270 --> 07:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
that at at no cost to them
 
07:05:48.280 --> 07:05:50.590 align:start position:0%
that at at no cost to them
um

07:05:50.590 --> 07:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:56.030 --> 07:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
um C could they do that within existing
 
07:05:58.468 --> 07:05:58.478 align:start position:0%
resources or are they going to have to
 
07:06:00.548 --> 07:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
hire somebody to do it is obviously
 
07:06:02.230 --> 07:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
going to take somebody some time to do
 
07:06:04.070 --> 07:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
that ju Just like it would to comply
 
07:06:07.350 --> 07:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
with with this um law although as stated
 
07:06:10.468 --> 07:06:10.478 align:start position:0%
ever Source already does it this way and
 
07:06:13.670 --> 07:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
and I should mention just Unitil I don't
 
07:06:15.110 --> 07:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
I can't remember if the external
 
07:06:17.270 --> 07:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
delivery charges separately listed but
 
07:06:19.070 --> 07:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's a subset of their delivery charge
 
07:06:20.628 --> 07:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
which is on the bill it shows up on
 
07:06:22.788 --> 07:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
bills it's just it's just a little
 
07:06:24.670 --> 07:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
buried just like this as a component of
 
07:06:26.190 --> 07:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
strained cost I don't think the
 
07:06:29.070 --> 07:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
incremental cost would be personally I I
 
07:06:31.388 --> 07:06:31.398 align:start position:0%
I can't see why it would be a big cost
 
07:06:34.548 --> 07:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
um unless you don't start with ISO New
 
07:06:37.548 --> 07:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
England data is better than no data as a
 
07:06:40.990 --> 07:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
good starting point I mean I will say
 
07:06:42.788 --> 07:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
that one representative eversource
 
07:06:45.310 --> 07:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
recently said to us that they think that
 
07:06:47.548 --> 07:06:47.558 align:start position:0%
uh if if they were that that they should
 
07:06:49.388 --> 07:06:49.398 align:start position:0%
take that if they were going to try to
 
07:06:51.628 --> 07:06:51.638 align:start position:0%
actually understand the impact of
 
07:06:55.350 --> 07:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
metering on load shapes they they should
 
07:06:58.270 --> 07:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
go to the commission and get uh approval
 
07:07:02.110 --> 07:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
from the commission to do a load uh uh
 
07:07:04.910 --> 07:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh study meaning putting in some um
 
07:07:07.750 --> 07:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
meters like they do to come up with load
 
07:07:11.350 --> 07:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
profiles now and try to uh spend two
 
07:07:15.070 --> 07:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
years to collect data to understand this
 
07:07:18.628 --> 07:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
um it's a little odd because under
 
07:07:20.750 --> 07:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
normal operations they've always had an
 
07:07:23.388 --> 07:07:23.398 align:start position:0%
obligation to try to understand uh load
 
07:07:25.910 --> 07:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
shapes of their customer base uh because
 
07:07:27.510 --> 07:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
they because the vast majority of
 
07:07:29.388 --> 07:07:29.398 align:start position:0%
eversource customers do not have
 
07:07:31.230 --> 07:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
interval metering so they only read the
 
07:07:33.468 --> 07:07:33.478 align:start position:0%
meter once a month so they you they used
 
07:07:35.750 --> 07:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
a certain number of uh research meters
 
07:07:38.628 --> 07:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
where they put in interview Vol meters
 
07:07:41.150 --> 07:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
you know maybe for a 100 customers or or
 
07:07:43.150 --> 07:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
some number of customers as a small
 
07:07:46.350 --> 07:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
sample and they use those load research
 
07:07:50.030 --> 07:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
meters as a um proxy for what
 
07:07:51.788 --> 07:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
everybody's load shape in the entire
 
07:07:53.590 --> 07:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
residential customer class or the small
 
07:07:56.468 --> 07:07:56.478 align:start position:0%
business customer class um only the very
 
07:07:58.030 --> 07:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
largest customers do they have interval
 
07:07:59.788 --> 07:07:59.798 align:start position:0%
meters were actually individual
 
07:08:02.270 --> 07:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
customers have their own individual load
 
07:08:04.190 --> 07:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
shapes that are
 
07:08:06.868 --> 07:08:06.878 align:start position:0%
knowable uh so so I guess the question
 
07:08:09.548 --> 07:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
is it might not cost too much but then
 
07:08:12.350 --> 07:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
again I I can't I can't speak for the
 
07:08:13.948 --> 07:08:13.958 align:start position:0%
utilities or
 
07:08:16.910 --> 07:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
doe thank you uh representative rolds
 
07:08:19.430 --> 07:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr Vice chairman and
 
07:08:21.948 --> 07:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Clifton for your
 
07:08:25.190 --> 07:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
thorough and um informative testimony
 
07:08:29.510 --> 07:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm a little confused isn't the kind
 
07:08:29.520 --> 07:08:30.670 align:start position:0%
but I'm a little confused isn't the kind
of

07:08:30.670 --> 07:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:08:36.070 --> 07:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
data that was the basis for the much you
 
07:08:38.388 --> 07:08:38.398 align:start position:0%
know long awaited and much Herald and
 
07:08:43.310 --> 07:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
and much talked about deer study and the
 
07:08:46.070 --> 07:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
the data that was the basis for the
 
07:08:50.868 --> 07:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
iso's presentation to to FK that the
 
07:08:53.708 --> 07:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
previous uh witness from clean energy
 
07:08:56.070 --> 07:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire talked about isn't
 
07:09:00.150 --> 07:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
that data the basis the basis for those
 
07:09:03.910 --> 07:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh those de study in the presentation to
 
07:09:07.788 --> 07:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
FK doesn't that exist already and it
 
07:09:11.590 --> 07:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
does about benefits of and I my
 
07:09:13.868 --> 07:09:13.878 align:start position:0%
understanding and you know read it
 
07:09:16.230 --> 07:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
pretty carefully um the the dunsky
 
07:09:18.788 --> 07:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
report does use a bunch of that data
 
07:09:20.670 --> 07:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
that ISO New England has collected that
 
07:09:23.230 --> 07:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
is specific to New Hampshire and the way
 
07:09:27.270 --> 07:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
they they've had a you know a a de sort
 
07:09:29.788 --> 07:09:29.798 align:start position:0%
of work group for over a decade now and
 
07:09:31.948 --> 07:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
they've developed this methodology and
 
07:09:33.430 --> 07:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the one ways they
 
07:09:35.910 --> 07:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
did it they contacted several one or
 
07:09:39.070 --> 07:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
more of the big inverter manufacturers
 
07:09:41.628 --> 07:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
who have a lot of uh inverters because
 
07:09:43.430 --> 07:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
because PV produces at direct current
 
07:09:46.150 --> 07:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
and converts to alternating current and
 
07:09:49.110 --> 07:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
most of those systems report you know I
 
07:09:52.110 --> 07:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
can pull out my phone and I can look at
 
07:09:54.190 --> 07:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh the inverter data that shows what my
 
07:09:57.868 --> 07:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
system is producing in any given hour
 
07:10:00.670 --> 07:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
for that matter and and and I actually
 
07:10:03.150 --> 07:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
have a uh Revenue grade metering that
 
07:10:05.310 --> 07:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
also I can match it against and and see
 
07:10:06.868 --> 07:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
that yeah that's that's that's a real
 
07:10:08.948 --> 07:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
number so what ISO New England did is
 
07:10:10.590 --> 07:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
they talked to these manufacturers they
 
07:10:12.110 --> 07:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
probably paid them some money and they
 
07:10:15.388 --> 07:10:15.398 align:start position:0%
said can you give us aggre data on your
 
07:10:17.750 --> 07:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of inverters so we can see
 
07:10:19.388 --> 07:10:19.398 align:start position:0%
actually what they produce and we can
 
07:10:22.110 --> 07:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
correlate that with WEA conditions and
 
07:10:23.948 --> 07:10:23.958 align:start position:0%
everything else and they've developed a
 
07:10:25.868 --> 07:10:25.878 align:start position:0%
fairly rust bottle that they're
 
07:10:28.868 --> 07:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
constantly correcting on a month I I
 
07:10:30.948 --> 07:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's monthly but um it
 
07:10:32.548 --> 07:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
it's at least monthly if not more
 
07:10:36.350 --> 07:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
frequently they take that realtime data
 
07:10:39.628 --> 07:10:39.638 align:start position:0%
that's coming in from uh uh I forget the
 
07:10:41.788 --> 07:10:41.798 align:start position:0%
number I cited it in our testimony th
 
07:10:45.030 --> 07:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
tens is well over 10,000 thousands of of
 
07:10:47.230 --> 07:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
data points for PV systems in New
 
07:10:50.070 --> 07:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
England they take that and match it
 
07:10:51.670 --> 07:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
against what actually happened on the
 
07:10:53.548 --> 07:10:53.558 align:start position:0%
system and so when you go to the iso New
 
07:10:56.350 --> 07:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
England app right this minute you can
 
07:10:59.628 --> 07:10:59.638 align:start position:0%
actually see um a curve when you look at
 
07:11:02.590 --> 07:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
the uh uh demand chart um there's a
 
07:11:04.510 --> 07:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
little orange line at the top of it
 
07:11:06.270 --> 07:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
which says what the demand would be in
 
07:11:09.670 --> 07:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
New England absent uh behind the meter
 
07:11:11.708 --> 07:11:11.718 align:start position:0%
solar and and they break that down by
 
07:11:14.388 --> 07:11:14.398 align:start position:0%
state so that's part of what dunky used
 
07:11:15.990 --> 07:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
some of that data does come from the
 
07:11:18.230 --> 07:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
utilities the utilities have provided
 
07:11:20.548 --> 07:11:20.558 align:start position:0%
them data about how many systems they've
 
07:11:22.590 --> 07:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
estimated what the size of those systems
 
07:11:24.468 --> 07:11:24.478 align:start position:0%
are and then ISO New England has
 
07:11:26.510 --> 07:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
correlated this with all this data that
 
07:11:28.468 --> 07:11:28.478 align:start position:0%
they're collecting which is aggregated
 
07:11:30.590 --> 07:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
data they don't get individual system
 
07:11:33.510 --> 07:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
data but they get it aggregated by State
 
07:11:35.310 --> 07:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
and and they're using it to develop a
 
07:11:36.948 --> 07:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
pretty good model that they they have a
 
07:11:40.468 --> 07:11:40.478 align:start position:0%
high confidence as as uh being uh uh
 
07:11:42.628 --> 07:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
reasonably accurate I think you've
 
07:11:45.510 --> 07:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
answered that question thoroughly sorry
 
07:11:48.948 --> 07:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
do you have a pertinent followup
 
07:11:52.468 --> 07:11:52.478 align:start position:0%
okay um you right at the end there you
 
07:11:54.990 --> 07:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
said pretty high they've developed this
 
07:11:56.628 --> 07:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
model that has they have pretty high
 
07:11:59.070 --> 07:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
confidence this is ISO New England yes
 
07:12:00.670 --> 07:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
so confident that they were willing to
 
07:12:04.430 --> 07:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
go to FK and say it's okay if Mystic
 
07:12:07.190 --> 07:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
Generating Station right there in Boston
 
07:12:11.110 --> 07:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
Harbor fueled by natural gas if it's
 
07:12:15.070 --> 07:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
okay if we let that system shut down if
 
07:12:17.350 --> 07:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
we let that plant shut down the region
 
07:12:19.388 --> 07:12:19.398 align:start position:0%
will still have adequate resources
 
07:12:21.468 --> 07:12:21.478 align:start position:0%
because of the presence of so much
 
07:12:24.030 --> 07:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
distributed generation and net meter
 
07:12:26.230 --> 07:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
let's let's answer that question as it
 
07:12:28.150 --> 07:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
pertains to this
 
07:12:34.030 --> 07:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
bill please um well just just quickly
 
07:12:35.910 --> 07:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
that that that plant was what was called
 
07:12:38.310 --> 07:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
re reliability must run uh
 
07:12:39.628 --> 07:12:39.638 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington could tell you
 
07:12:41.388 --> 07:12:41.398 align:start position:0%
a lot of there's a lot of history there
 
07:12:43.388 --> 07:12:43.398 align:start position:0%
it's above Market it's it's costing
 
07:12:45.628 --> 07:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
people to keep that plant running and
 
07:12:47.788 --> 07:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
what ISO New England you know with they
 
07:12:49.948 --> 07:12:49.958 align:start position:0%
had the confidence in that data set so
 
07:12:52.910 --> 07:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the of the question um
 
07:12:55.788 --> 07:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
that they could go in and say with a
 
07:12:58.990 --> 07:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
straight face that there's enough
 
07:13:01.388 --> 07:13:01.398 align:start position:0%
distributed generation in New England
 
07:13:04.468 --> 07:13:04.478 align:start position:0%
that is producing even in the wintertime
 
07:13:07.788 --> 07:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
uh that it helps with the problem and
 
07:13:10.190 --> 07:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
and and just so you know the problem is
 
07:13:11.868 --> 07:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
that we have limited pipeline capacity
 
07:13:15.468 --> 07:13:15.478 align:start position:0%
so on very cold days um uh gas powered
 
07:13:17.910 --> 07:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
plants which rely on just not paying for
 
07:13:19.830 --> 07:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
transportation because they buy it at a
 
07:13:22.350 --> 07:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
discount because it Surplus plus 98% of
 
07:13:24.948 --> 07:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
the time they come up short and
 
07:13:28.150 --> 07:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes aren't running but but the but
 
07:13:30.190 --> 07:13:30.200 align:start position:0%
what what I understand I so New England
 
07:13:32.190 --> 07:13:32.200 align:start position:0%
found is there's enough output from
 
07:13:35.030 --> 07:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
distributed generation even in in the on
 
07:13:37.628 --> 07:13:37.638 align:start position:0%
cold winter days uh that it conserves
 
07:13:40.590 --> 07:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
enough fuel uh so that they've you know
 
07:13:42.628 --> 07:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
most of these power plants now have
 
07:13:45.590 --> 07:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
petroleum that they can airiz to to when
 
07:13:47.670 --> 07:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
when they don't have gas or they have
 
07:13:50.070 --> 07:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
propane that they can inject or whatever
 
07:13:53.270 --> 07:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
but the point was that we now have
 
07:13:55.628 --> 07:13:55.638 align:start position:0%
enough capacity that we can get through
 
07:13:57.708 --> 07:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
extreme cold snaps without that power
 
07:13:59.868 --> 07:13:59.878 align:start position:0%
plant because of the amount of output
 
07:14:01.948 --> 07:14:01.958 align:start position:0%
from distributed generation even though
 
07:14:04.110 --> 07:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's not precisely at the same time it
 
07:14:06.708 --> 07:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
helps those power plants uh extend the
 
07:14:08.590 --> 07:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
power supply that the fuel supply that
 
07:14:10.788 --> 07:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
they have on hand to meet uh extreme
 
07:14:14.510 --> 07:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
weather conditions thank you
 
07:14:14.520 --> 07:14:16.830 align:start position:0%
weather conditions thank you
representative

07:14:16.830 --> 07:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:14:21.548 --> 07:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr Vice chair um so I'd
 
07:14:23.230 --> 07:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
like to bring it back to we're going to
 
07:14:26.388 --> 07:14:26.398 align:start position:0%
be executing this bill tomorrow and um I
 
07:14:28.670 --> 07:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
always appreciate the authority that you
 
07:14:30.350 --> 07:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
bring to the chair and answering our
 
07:14:32.190 --> 07:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
questions around what's going on with
 
07:14:35.750 --> 07:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
with energy in New England um but the
 
07:14:36.948 --> 07:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
thing that struck me about your
 
07:14:39.868 --> 07:14:39.878 align:start position:0%
testimony is you know I was here for HB
 
07:14:44.430 --> 07:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
315 I I um understand that part of the
 
07:14:46.270 --> 07:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
impetus for the House and Senate
 
07:14:47.510 --> 07:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
supporting that bill and it getting
 
07:14:50.190 --> 07:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
signed into law was the Fulfillment of
 
07:14:50.200 --> 07:14:52.548 align:start position:0%
signed into law was the Fulfillment of
competition

07:14:52.548 --> 07:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
competition
 
07:14:54.750 --> 07:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
in service of lowering people's bills
 
07:14:57.310 --> 07:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
right so that the the competitive piece
 
07:14:59.548 --> 07:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
and what I'm hearing from your testimony
 
07:15:02.190 --> 07:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
is that it appears that that competition
 
07:15:04.548 --> 07:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
will be edged out in some way because
 
07:15:06.468 --> 07:15:06.478 align:start position:0%
you can't compete if we provide
 
07:15:08.750 --> 07:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
advantages to the utilities that are not
 
07:15:10.388 --> 07:15:10.398 align:start position:0%
afforded to those other people who are
 
07:15:12.430 --> 07:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
currently that we put in place to
 
07:15:14.548 --> 07:15:14.558 align:start position:0%
provide competition is that an accurate
 
07:15:18.150 --> 07:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
assessment yes is it so um that's secur
 
07:15:21.270 --> 07:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
it okay so so we would be undermining
 
07:15:24.750 --> 07:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
our own efforts there right and and
 
07:15:27.990 --> 07:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
furthermore I I I've just got to say
 
07:15:30.350 --> 07:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
this I'm sorry I haven't grafted it yet
 
07:15:33.150 --> 07:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
but in Discovery what we could see is
 
07:15:35.190 --> 07:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty steep ramp in the last
 
07:15:38.070 --> 07:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
few years of customers n of growth in
 
07:15:39.750 --> 07:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
net metering both absolute numbers of
 
07:15:45.110 --> 07:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
customers and in the capacity and um we
 
07:15:47.548 --> 07:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
uh our
 
07:15:50.110 --> 07:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
communities um and our local energy
 
07:15:53.788 --> 07:15:53.798 align:start position:0%
committees are aware of a multitude of
 
07:15:58.070 --> 07:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
sites that would be suitable for uh net
 
07:16:01.868 --> 07:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
metering you know up up to a megawatt or
 
07:16:05.110 --> 07:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
up to five megawatts um that we would
 
07:16:07.230 --> 07:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
like to be direct off-takers for we
 
07:16:09.590 --> 07:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
would like to say we're getting part of
 
07:16:12.190 --> 07:16:12.200 align:start position:0%
our power from a local renewable energy
 
07:16:14.628 --> 07:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
resource they're not on utility default
 
07:16:16.750 --> 07:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
service so it's no cost to the utility
 
07:16:18.830 --> 07:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
of default service customers there are
 
07:16:21.270 --> 07:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
customer generators and we would like to
 
07:16:23.350 --> 07:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
be able to use that output to offset
 
07:16:27.110 --> 07:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
what we otherwise have to buy um uh and
 
07:16:28.868 --> 07:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
it and that's actually what happens from
 
07:16:33.030 --> 07:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
a physics point of view um but um that
 
07:16:36.350 --> 07:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
that is what would get precluded because
 
07:16:39.990 --> 07:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
modifying the load settlement uh uh for
 
07:16:44.990 --> 07:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
us and for um the utility uh default
 
07:16:47.590 --> 07:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
service um when we recover our cost from
 
07:16:49.548 --> 07:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
our customers but they recover their
 
07:16:51.990 --> 07:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
cost whether they're uh in excess of the
 
07:16:55.910 --> 07:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
benefits or not uh from all customers so
 
07:16:58.708 --> 07:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
it's an unal playing field that we can't
 
07:17:01.230 --> 07:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
compete against so we would unless you
 
07:17:04.628 --> 07:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
said okay uh if we compensate net
 
07:17:07.468 --> 07:17:07.478 align:start position:0%
metered uh at the same or a lower rate
 
07:17:09.430 --> 07:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
than the utilities do we can we can put
 
07:17:10.750 --> 07:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
we can put that in the stranded cost
 
07:17:12.830 --> 07:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
recovery charge then we can say well at
 
07:17:14.468 --> 07:17:14.478 align:start position:0%
least we can compensate you even though
 
07:17:15.910 --> 07:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
we don't get the benefit for it
 
07:17:17.510 --> 07:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
everybody will get the benefit for it
 
07:17:19.070 --> 07:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
because it'll but we won't be able to
 
07:17:20.590 --> 07:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
tell you what it is because it's it's
 
07:17:22.788 --> 07:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
buried in this residual I mean that's I
 
07:17:24.110 --> 07:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
guess that's if we don't change the
 
07:17:26.788 --> 07:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
system if we do change the system uh
 
07:17:28.230 --> 07:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
then then then then I think we should
 
07:17:29.948 --> 07:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
still be able to serve net meter
 
07:17:32.270 --> 07:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
customers I think your answer was yes
 
07:17:35.030 --> 07:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you I'm sorry it's
 
07:17:36.990 --> 07:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
late and I'm rambling mon I'll take the
 
07:17:39.070 --> 07:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
last question from representative Ms
 
07:17:41.070 --> 07:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
07:17:43.670 --> 07:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my question I want to I
 
07:17:45.868 --> 07:17:45.878 align:start position:0%
want to try to summarize what I think
 
07:17:47.468 --> 07:17:47.478 align:start position:0%
I've heard here and hopefully you can
 
07:17:49.510 --> 07:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
tell me whether I'm on the right path or
 
07:17:52.750 --> 07:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
not um you know what we heard testimony
 
07:17:54.070 --> 07:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
earlier and I think you were here for
 
07:17:58.310 --> 07:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
that that basically said that this bill
 
07:18:01.270 --> 07:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
as it's written doesn't change anything
 
07:18:02.708 --> 07:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
from the way things are being done right
 
07:18:06.270 --> 07:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
now right that all it does is is codify
 
07:18:09.510 --> 07:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
that in law and what I'm hearing from
 
07:18:13.708 --> 07:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
you I I think is that there's a lot of
 
07:18:16.468 --> 07:18:16.478 align:start position:0%
stuff that we do right now that really
 
07:18:20.788 --> 07:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
is not in the best interests of of
 
07:18:22.868 --> 07:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
aggregate power but you know from a
 
07:18:24.590 --> 07:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
public policy point of view the state as
 
07:18:27.948 --> 07:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
a whole and my guess is that your
 
07:18:30.510 --> 07:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
concern is that if this bill passes it
 
07:18:32.830 --> 07:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
makes it just that much harder to
 
07:18:36.468 --> 07:18:36.478 align:start position:0%
address those concerns yes um and then
 
07:18:39.388 --> 07:18:39.398 align:start position:0%
as a as a followup the followup ahead
 
07:18:42.510 --> 07:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
what you're really I think looking for
 
07:18:44.510 --> 07:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
is a bill to address some of the
 
07:18:44.520 --> 07:18:46.388 align:start position:0%
is a bill to address some of the
underlying

07:18:46.388 --> 07:18:46.398 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
07:18:48.670 --> 07:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
problems that goes Way Beyond what this
 
07:18:51.788 --> 07:18:51.798 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to do well and then no
 
07:18:54.230 --> 07:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking you to try to amend this
 
07:18:57.628 --> 07:18:57.638 align:start position:0%
bill to do something different um I'm
 
07:18:59.590 --> 07:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
just saying if you're going to do it
 
07:19:03.708 --> 07:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
you'd either need to uh limit the
 
07:19:05.628 --> 07:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
mandate to those costs that are in
 
07:19:08.510 --> 07:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
excessive benefits so that they can be
 
07:19:12.070 --> 07:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
matched and paired up or and or if
 
07:19:13.948 --> 07:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about transparency
 
07:19:15.350 --> 07:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
there may be another way to get the
 
07:19:17.190 --> 07:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
transparency that is even more
 
07:19:19.670 --> 07:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
transparent and also lets people know
 
07:19:21.670 --> 07:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
that they're actually are benefits that
 
07:19:23.388 --> 07:19:23.398 align:start position:0%
could be Quantified but it's changing
 
07:19:26.948 --> 07:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
the Status Quo that's okay and just just
 
07:19:31.750 --> 07:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to say is um it it's because
 
07:19:35.510 --> 07:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
th this treating these exports as zero
 
07:19:38.990 --> 07:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
for load settlement purposes is
 
07:19:42.948 --> 07:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
why this competition is not happened so
 
07:19:45.750 --> 07:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
far you know when a year ago we were
 
07:19:48.070 --> 07:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
fully expecting that we would be able to
 
07:19:50.030 --> 07:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
serve net beer customers we had a plan
 
07:19:51.948 --> 07:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
for how we would compensate them and all
 
07:19:54.830 --> 07:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
that stuff until we found out that we
 
07:19:56.750 --> 07:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
weren't going to get any data except for
 
07:20:01.430 --> 07:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
zeros and that there was question plan
 
07:20:05.948 --> 07:20:05.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh address that law that
 
07:20:09.750 --> 07:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
says you shall uh settle the load as an
 
07:20:13.628 --> 07:20:13.638 align:start position:0%
offset and and just my final comment is
 
07:20:15.548 --> 07:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
that is one of the questions that's in
 
07:20:17.230 --> 07:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
the net metering statute that the
 
07:20:19.548 --> 07:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
commission is directed to answer which
 
07:20:22.948 --> 07:20:22.958 align:start position:0%
is sure should we change load settlement
 
07:20:25.270 --> 07:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
for default Service as well to count
 
07:20:27.788 --> 07:20:27.798 align:start position:0%
those exports to the grid as an offset
 
07:20:30.030 --> 07:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
to what the supplier has to otherwise
 
07:20:32.270 --> 07:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
purchase from ISO New England this bill
 
07:20:34.190 --> 07:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
would preempt the commission from
 
07:20:35.750 --> 07:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
answering that question that the
 
07:20:37.868 --> 07:20:37.878 align:start position:0%
legislature told them to answer thank
 
07:20:41.430 --> 07:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
you I believe we've uh covered the
 
07:20:43.948 --> 07:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
subject no further questions thank you
 
07:20:47.670 --> 07:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Bao uh for your very thorough
 
07:20:49.548 --> 07:20:49.558 align:start position:0%
presentation I thought we were sitting
 
07:20:51.788 --> 07:20:51.798 align:start position:0%
in the Pu right now
 
07:20:55.030 --> 07:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
but uh thank you very much I have no
 
07:20:58.110 --> 07:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
further uh speakers so I will declare
 
07:21:04.310 --> 07:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:06.670 --> 07:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
hearing uh well we haven't done the
 
07:21:08.310 --> 07:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
others yet I would like to get it all at
 
07:21:09.788 --> 07:21:09.798 align:start position:0%
the same time I'm going to leave that up
 
07:21:12.150 --> 07:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
to the chair as the one he wants it
 
07:21:15.990 --> 07:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
presented on that one here uh with that
 
07:21:19.230 --> 07:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on 1398 is
 
07:21:19.240 --> 07:21:22.510 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on 1398 is
closed

07:21:22.510 --> 07:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:49.150 --> 07:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:49.160 --> 07:21:58.868 align:start position:0%
 
Vose

07:21:58.868 --> 07:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:00.468 --> 07:22:00.478 align:start position:0%
all the business we have to conduct
 
07:22:02.990 --> 07:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
today we will resume activity tomorrow
 
07:22:04.270 --> 07:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
morning at
