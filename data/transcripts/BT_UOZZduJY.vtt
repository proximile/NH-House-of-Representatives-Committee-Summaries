slides I'd like to walk you through
 
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
those um we've ALS Al provided two
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
letters of support one from the business
 
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
and industry Association and one from
 
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Life Sciences
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
Association and you'll recall that um
 
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
when we were here in January to provide
 
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
an orientation to division 2 walked
 
00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
through a lot of information about
 
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment demographics the number of
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
students the programs that we have that
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
relate to Workforce needs what we've
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
been doing about it I'm not going to
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
repeat that information information that
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
I provided I'm happy to answer any
 
00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
questions but we walked through quite a
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
bit of material when we were here in
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
January for
 
00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
orientation so um on on slide two I
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
provide this because um frankly I look
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
at it fairly frequently to remind myself
 
00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 align:start position:0%
the importance of the work uh that's
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
done across the university system this
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
is section one of RSA
 
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
187a it's the enable aing legislation
 
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
that uh creates the university
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
system and um the university system is
 
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
to provide programs which serve the
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
needs of the state and the nation
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
research which contributes to the
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
welfare of mankind to the development of
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
faculty and to the educational
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
experience of students for its faculty
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
and staff to bring educational resources
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
and professional experience to the
 
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
benefit of the state and the state's
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
people um
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
this is our mission and we take it very
 
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
seriously and of course I'm probably
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
biased but the university system is good
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
at what it does and um it is a
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
tremendous resource to the state as a
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
whole to our businesses and to the
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
citizenry so just want to start with
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
that on slide three is a summary of the
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget the
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget bium over
 
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.749 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget bium over
bium

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
bium
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
including the one-time funding I'll talk
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
about that in just a minute it's a um
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
$16.5 million reduction in University
 
00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:12.759 align:start position:0%
system funding um from 2425 to 2627
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
that's about 8.3%
 
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
reduction um and we will feel that
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
reduction I'll talk a minute about other
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
costs we have to take out of our cost
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
structure and um we respectfully request
 
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
that state funding be held at the
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
government Governor's
 
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
level not flat funding but not a deeper
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
cut than the
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
88.3% we have modeled out what that
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
looks like at 91.2 million we know in
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 we have to take out about $20
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
million in cost out of our cost
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
structure and we're working toward that
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
earlier the um we talked about during
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
the orientation we've reduced employ
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
headcount we've reduced medical benefits
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
increased premiums we've reduced
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
retirement contributions we're selling
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
property we're getting out of leases um
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
we recognize with a decline in
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment we must um act prudently and
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
decisions so on slide four again quick
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
recap our total enrollment in the fall
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
of 24 was 23
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
3,000 um our our res non resident
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
non-resident split is about 5050 across
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
the university system 83% of our uh
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
students are
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
undergrads UNH makes up about 69% of our
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
total enrollment with Keane at 14% And
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
Plymouth at
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
177% the University system is a
 
00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
significant driver for Workforce
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
pipeline each year about 3,000 are of
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
our graduates enter the New Hampshire
 
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce we have relationships with
 
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of businesses across um the
 
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
state um again which I think is
 
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
indicative of the letters of support
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
that you've received from the business
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
and industry Association and the New
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Life Sciences
 
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
Association UNH is one of only 187
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
universities in the country that are
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
classified as R1 R1 is a carneg Carnegie
 
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
classification which indicates highest
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
level of research which is very
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
impressive for a university the size of
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
unh now I will tell you if you go back
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
and look at the material from the
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
orientation the number was one out of
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
146 but now it's 187 so um also Keenan
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
Plymouth much smaller institutions but
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
they are deeply embedded in in the badok
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
region and the Lakes region in the North
 
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.710 align:start position:0%
region and the Lakes region in the North
country

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
okay so Slide Five I want to take some
 
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
time and walk through some numbers I
 
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.949 align:start position:0%
time and walk through some numbers I
think

00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes um maybe it's a mystery of
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
what the finances of the University
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
system are and how it works so this is a
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
highlevel summary I just want to walk
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
you through some line items and this is
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
a snapshot um again a summary from the
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
University Systems audited financial
 
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
statements the income statement profit
 
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
and loss statement from 2019 and
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
2024 you might say why did Kathy use
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
2019 well the covid years make it very
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
difficult sometimes to look at the
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
audited financial statements and make a
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
comparison with all the federal dollars
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
that were coming in with the room and
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
board we had to rebate all of that so I
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
I just want to walk through this is a
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
five-year change on our income statement
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
so you'll see tuition and the Top Line
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
gross tuition and fees has
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
dropped even though there there's been
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
no price increase on New Hampshire
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
resident students during that time there
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
has been a price increase on
 
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
non-resident students about 2 and a
 
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
half% per year but you still see a
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
decline in that gross because our
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment is
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
declining on the second line You'll see
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
at the same time time that gross tuition
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
and fees has declined our financial aid
 
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.509 align:start position:0%
and fees has declined our financial aid
has

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:34.519 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
increased which is why over that same
 
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
time period for our New Hampshire
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
students net tuition and fees on average
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
has actually dropped during that time
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
period so this net tuition fees that
 
00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:48.949 align:start position:0%
period so this net tuition fees that
highlighted

00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
highlighted
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
row that's dropped
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
15% and that's what's available if you
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
will for the University system
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
to um run its operation ations as as far
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
as tuition and fees goes auxiliary
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
Services that's room and board primarily
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
room and board that's increased because
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
we've had price
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
increases the next line is an important
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
one it's grants and contracts we talked
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit about this during
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
orientation grants and contracts you'll
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
see our research Enterprise has
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
increased significantly over that those
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
five years that also includes pel grants
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
which is about 20 Mill ion 22 million so
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's not a big change in that line
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
from pel Grants but Federal research
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
grants have significantly increased
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
which is why in a minute I'll show you
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see increases in
 
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
spend from research right a dollar for
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
the most part a dollar in is a dollar
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
out um State Appropriations that 21%
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
increase in the five years includes uh
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
$3 million in fiscal 24 of one-time
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
money that was appropriated for Plymouth
 
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.670 align:start position:0%
money that was appropriated for Plymouth
and

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
Keane if we if we look at the recurring
 
00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
if you will a recurring uh Grant um that
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
increase from 19 to 24 fiscal 19 to 24
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
is about a 177% increase in state
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
Appropriations which the university
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
system and our students very much appre
 
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that's how we've been able to
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
keep New Hampshire tuition flat for the
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
first time this fall for the first time
 
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.670 align:start position:0%
first time this fall for the first time
since

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
2013 our New Hampshire resident student
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
population increased and I really
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
believe uh a lot of that has to do with
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
being able to keep New Hampshire tuition
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
flat and and why is that
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
important we know that our New Hampshire
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
resident students are more likely to
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
stay and work here in our state
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see employee
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
compensation has increased 6% over those
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
5 years over a time period where
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
inflation was
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
23% and over a time period that research
 
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.110 align:start position:0%
23% and over a time period that research
increased

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
increased
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
59% so if I would pull
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
out research uh Grant funded positions
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
our employee comp actually
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
dropped the supplies and services line
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
you see that significant increase also a
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
lot of that has to do with the research
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
dollars so if we have
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
subcontracts if there's equipment
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
involved that that would be in that line
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
and that increase is a direct result of
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
that re that
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
Grant increas in Grant funded
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
research I do want to point out this
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
this often comes up as a question
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
endowments so the University
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
System including the UNH Foundation Keen
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
state has a small Foundation the value
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
of the all the endowments at June 30 of
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
24 was $988 Million which is a very big
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
number almost all of that remember UNH
 
00:15:22.829 --> 00:15:22.839 align:start position:0%
has been around for 150 years so it's
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
donor monies that are designated for
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
specific purposes also included in that
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
is um many years of the unique college
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship program um there are also
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
what we call quasi endowments uh it's a
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
financing tool if we've issued um debt
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be a a a bullet payout
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
years from now we've put money aside so
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
we're ready to pay that bullet when it
 
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
comes due so that endowment pays out and
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
this is what also very common pays out
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
about 42% per year you say why 42% per
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
year because we we want to minimize
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
volatility if you have a year that the
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
stock market drops 15% we still want to
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
be able to pay out that 4 and a half%
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
because it's funding scholarships and a
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
number of other things so what pays out
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
each year is4 to $45 million for
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
scholarships for um there is a piece
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
about $12 million a year supports our
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
campus budgets so that that is all part
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
of the endowment now that line that says
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
endowment gifts and
 
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
returns that's primarily market gains on
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
that some years are much better than
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
others but again we try to minimize
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
volatility um ALS so well it's up to the
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
committee chair happy to take questions
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
during our time or we can wait until the
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
end and as always Lauren and I will all
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
happily follow up with material if we
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
haven't covered some of your questions
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
morning representative Murray thank you
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
just quick since we're on this um with
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
regards to the endowment um some of the
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
organizations will use rolling quarters
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
um in or so what is your Ro you know how
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
do you what what goes into the what
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
determines the payout it's the average
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
um Market or fair value over 12 Rolling
 
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.470 align:start position:0%
um Market or fair value over 12 Rolling
quarters

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
quarters get my notebook out in case
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
with that's it that's it who for now
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay that's wow um any others
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
so I have a couple of questions for you
 
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
then sure what has the increase been in
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
administrative salaries over this time
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
period specific to administrative
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
salaries I'll have to can I get that for
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up yeah if you don't have it
 
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
me I'm just going to keep a list here
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative so we can follow up after
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
the hearing and I think you gave the
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
percentage but I wasn't quick enough to
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
get it down but in any case while
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
students population's been declining
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
increasing total employee compensation
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah is that what you said right here 6%
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
that I will say what what I would like
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
to get for you is Break It Out by grants
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
and non-g grants because as the grants
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
the research dollars have increased by
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
59% some some of that compensation will
 
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
relate to okay researchers that had to
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
that were hired to during that so I will
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
get for you by Grant funded and
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
non-grant funded what's happened with
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
the employee compensation perfect and
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
then compensation per student is what
 
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for compensation for per
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
student in other words account for the
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
fact that your population of students
 
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
has been declining with
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative papovich and if I
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
may just add a little to what chairman
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
Earth was asking when you talk about the
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
compensation for the admins it would be
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
useful to have both the compensation and
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
the head counts just to put it in better
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
context sure and if uh there are admins
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
specifically related to Grants like you
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
were suggesting that you want to break
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
it down between feel free to break it
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
down those ways so uh you know this way
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
we won't have to ask for more details
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
later for certain thank
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
you and then while you finish writing go
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
ahead are you done writing I don't want
 
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
I okay regarding the unique M um mention
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
so you said that that that was part of
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
what built up your endowment is that
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
accurate now my understanding was that
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
was what is intended to be used for
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
scholarships so so and this this goes
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
back to my time even as state treasur
 
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
even before I was State Treasurer so
 
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.710 align:start position:0%
even before I was State Treasurer so
that

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
program the New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
has a 529 plan through Fidelity and um
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
the dollars that come to the state from
 
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.190 align:start position:0%
the dollars that come to the state from
that

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
plan um for many many years let's say
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
$100 would come in was much more than
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
that obviously $70 of that 70% of that
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
would go to Every college and
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
university private and public Community
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
College all of our highered institutions
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
$70 would be distributed based on
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
student count New Hampshire student
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
count to build up an
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
endowment 30% so $30 would go directly
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
to the institutions for annual
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
scholarships that would go right out the
 
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.390 align:start position:0%
scholarships that would go right out the
door

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
door
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
so oh my word it's it's probably been
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
20 could be 25 years now that that
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
program has been in
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
place two years ago two years ago I
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
believe we flipped it so now 30% of the
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
dollars that come in the door go to the
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
endowments at all the schools and 70% of
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
the dollars go straight out to students
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
so there were two revenue
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
streams and so over time for the
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
University system over those 25 years
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's built up to about $90
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
million in endowment that's in that
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
endowment that pays out 4 and a half%
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
per year for the neediest New Hampshire
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
students and the eligibility criteria is
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
established by the college savings
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
commission and that pays out so it's
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
going to be there in perpetuity that
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
will pay out for New Hampshire needy New
 
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students at all of the
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
institutions public and private across
 
00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:21.549 align:start position:0%
institutions public and private across
the

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
state can I ask you a question Mr landan
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
regarding the 15 the is this the related
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
certainly so um again this so I have
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
some experience as state treasure I also
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
currently sit on the college savings
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
tuition planning committee um
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
so about $15
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
million comes into the state that might
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
be actually a little more than that
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
right now comes into the state from
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
Fidelity from it's millions of dollars
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the in the 529 plan under the New
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unique program there's a fee
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
that Fidelity pays to the state say it's
 
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.390 align:start position:0%
that Fidelity pays to the state say it's
$15

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
$15
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
million of that $15 million right now
 
00:23:18.669 --> 00:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
30% goes to so so just to be clear it's
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
that it's that pot of money that you're
 
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
talking about with all the percentages
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
100 yes okay that that's I was trying to
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
understand thank you that makes sense to
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
me back to your endowment payout so
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
4 half% seems kind of low especially
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
given that you've had pretty substantial
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
I assume like everybody else growth in
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
your underlying Investments so our
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return over the long
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
term is six and a half% and so but you
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
think about an inflation component so 4
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
and a
 
00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:54.110 align:start position:0%
and a
half%

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
half%
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
is not unusual for an endowment payout
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
over the long term because some years we
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
will achieve more than
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
62% but in the years when it goes below
 
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
that or goes in the red it takes long
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
time to make up a loss in the market so
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's why it's yes we could we could
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
achieve 10% or 12% but we don't we
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
don't calculate the payout based on one
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
year's um earnings we smooth it to
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
reduce volatility over the long term and
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
do you have some statistics on similarly
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
endowed schools regarding their payouts
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing I can absolutely
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
get that for
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
you I'll just get it straight from the
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
horse's mouth
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
here she just saying I get from about
 
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
the sources but I'd rather get it from
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
you of
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
course I'm sure she'll help me
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.070 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
you anybody else on okay this is exactly
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
why I wanted to bring it up because I
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
know it it comes up often around
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
endowment so happy to answer any
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
questions super thank please continue
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your on slide six I just
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
want to um this is an excerpt from the
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
business and industry associations one
 
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
of its policy priorities for
 
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
2025 is to explore poor incentives to
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
keep New Hampshire students in New
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as I mentioned um for the
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
first time since 2013 our enrollment
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
actually our New Hampshire enrollment
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
actually increased in the fall of
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
24 and at the same time our surrounding
 
00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
states are dealing with the same thing
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
we are in all across New England there
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
are our demographics there are fewer
 
00:25:57.549 --> 00:25:57.559 align:start position:0%
young people in the pipeline so they're
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
doubling down trying to keep their
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
students and take our students at the
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
same time with with investment and um
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
you know we we need to continue to
 
00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:11.559 align:start position:0%
attract equip and retain our students to
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
drive the workforce of the future here
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and on slide seven I want
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
to get into this a little more and I
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
talked earlier about that's that's why I
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
included slide one with section one of
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
RSA 187a
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
um it is a public Mission and we're
 
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0%
committed to delivering on that public
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
Mission the
 
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
um as in this fastpaced changing
 
00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
environment in the future we will need
 
00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
folks that have education at all
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
levels High School certificate
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
Associates Bachelors gradu we will need
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
people that have education in at all
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
different different levels and so it's
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
it's the part in my mind it's the
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
partnership um that we need to Foster
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
across business higher ed government K12
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
to drive that um the honestly that's one
 
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
of the things I think about when we have
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
fewer people in the pipeline and we know
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
that not just business and industry all
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
of our employers across the state one of
 
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
their biggest concerns as Workforce so
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
when we think about what we look like 10
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
years we the state our citizenry 10
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
years from now in my mind we need to
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
ensure we have that pipeline for for
 
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce according to the Department of
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs life
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
sciences and advanced manufacturing are
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
real growth areas and the university
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
system is very much plugged in to um to
 
00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
those sectors and others and again indic
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
indicative of the letter letters of
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
so while we are facing some significant
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
headwinds and we need to continue to
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
structures right now the university
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
system does have a strong balance sheet
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure we keep it that
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
way um and that's how we are able to
 
00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:29.430 align:start position:0%
way um and that's how we are able to
make

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
investments that will and deliver on our
 
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
public mission that will benefit the
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
state and Workforce in the future I just
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
want to give you a couple of examples
 
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
because we have been making those
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
Advance those Investments with
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
significant support from the state $35
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
million over a six-year period in the
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
capital budget UNH actually I think the
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
ribbon cutting is this summer um just
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
completed a $95 million Life Sciences
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
Spalding uh Life
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
Sciences building um it was an ex it was
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
a renovation of of an old the old
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
Spalding Life Sciences with that $35
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
million the university system invested
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
another $60
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
million that's to ensure that we can
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
attract students faculty collaborate
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
with business on Innovative work in the
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
Life Sciences field well into the
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
future at Plymouth um Hyde Hall I think
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
will also be opening maybe in the fall
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
it's the Innovation and
 
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519 align:start position:0%
Entrepreneur Center business for the
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
North Country um the state supported
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
through cap with through Capital support
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
um I think we're up to maybe $5
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
million University system invested
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
another $22 million
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
recently I don't know if folks are
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Olson Advanced
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing center over at UNH it's
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
quite the place um the the also at UNH
 
00:30:16.509 --> 00:30:16.519 align:start position:0%
through Noah the National Oceanic
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
atmospheric Association um UNH does very
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge research with Noah and Noah
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
um through a grant with Noah there'll be
 
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
a facility um Noah facility constructed
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
at at
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
un and our board just approved an
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
additional $9 million
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
investment to we have part cor um
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
business partners collocated at the Olen
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
center it's high Bas based High Advanced
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and we are going to
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
construct the facility so that we can
 
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
have more corporate Partners research
 
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
students are working with these
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
corporate Partners High School Community
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
College University students all working
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
on Advanced manufacturing cuttingedge
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
Innovative Advanced manufacturing and
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
that will also be located um with that
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
Noah building on the UNH campus uh the
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
these are examples of we know it's
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
important to our students our faculty
 
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
and our state that that we have a
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
pipeline into that those new and
 
00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:37.509 align:start position:0%
pipeline into that those new and
advancing

00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
advancing
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
Technologies we've already on slide nine
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about our
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
enrollment decline the our enrollments
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
declined 11% during that that fiveyear
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
period from the income statement I I
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
walked you through
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
earlier I already mentioned um that will
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
have real impacts on our future
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce needs and we know I think I
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
already mentioned for fiscal 26 we need
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
to take $20 million out of our cost
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
structure so difficult difficult
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
decisions we're being worked on right
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
now um we frankly can't nibble around
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
the edges anymore we start need we need
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
to start making some decisions about
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
what are we not going to do um as as the
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
um and those those we're developing
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
now I I just want to point out um we
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
know we have to make those difficult
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
decisions we are and we will um we don't
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
seek State support to avoid making those
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions and um which is why
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not sitting here asking that we need
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
flat funding we know I well know from my
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh former life life as state treasure
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
the state is facing some very very
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions so not anyway I I'll
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
that representa Dory can you give us
 
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
some idea what you're thinking what
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
areas you're thinking about decreasing
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
knowing that you have the economic
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
drivers that you need to have in place
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
but what what areas are you thinking
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
about cutting um thank you
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
representative for the question I'd
 
00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
rather not get into any specifics right
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
now um we are um at we are having
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
conversations about Academic Program
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
sharing across our institutions so that
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
if one institution um is no longer going
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
to offer a certain major or a certain
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
course that a student could take a class
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
let's say they're a Plymouth student and
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
they they Plymouth doesn't have that
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
program anymore they could take the
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
class and UNH if that's where we're
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
offered or Keen to really um leverage
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
online capabilities to do that
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
so it's possible to make some decisions
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
around well we're not going to have this
 
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
major or this program at this school
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
anymore we're going to have it here
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to focus on
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
Specialties we're also
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're uh developing
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
strategies with AI um what how can we
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
leverage AI to produce more
 
00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.790 align:start position:0%
leverage AI to produce more
administrative

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
work um
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of conversations
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
happening um you know we need to think
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
about so we have shortterm right we have
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
a uh actions we need to take quickly so
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
so our budgets our board um requires
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
through our budget parameters that um
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
the university system have a 1%
 
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.190 align:start position:0%
the university system have a 1%
operating

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
operating
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
margin so for those of you that have
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
worked in business you'll say well
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's not very much a 1% operating
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
margin really what a 1% operating margin
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
in my mind is a flat budget with a
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of a contingency in it right
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
um it's just that and the board our
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
board has said you we need to get to a
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
place where we're 2 3% operating margin
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
be because that's what we can use to
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
then invest in things like
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
the Ola manufacturing center and the
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
Life Sciences Center so um right now
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
because of the headwinds because we
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
recognize that the state also has has
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
decisions to make the 1% operating
 
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
margin is where we are um but even to
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
get there with enrollment declining we
 
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
need to to um make changes the other
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
thing we're really drilling into is
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
facilities our footprint um with fewer
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
students we don't need the footprint
 
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
that we'll need in the long term that's
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
a longer term play we can't you know
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's February we can't change on a
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
dime and drive a big reduction in
 
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
footprint by July but how do we think
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
about that that comes back to academic
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
programming if academic programming is
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
going to change the footprint should
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
change with it so that's why we're
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
selling buildings we've demolished
 
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.079 align:start position:0%
buildings we're getting out of leas
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
space um but we have to push on that
 
00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.230 align:start position:0%
space um but we have to push on that
even

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
further can you share with us as far as
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
a manufacturing component is is is
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
happening who's driving your life
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
sciences what manufacturer here in in
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is actually coming to you and
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
saying I'm going to drop in couple
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
million bucks here or you know 100
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
million bucks who is
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
that well we don't have any private
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
dollars that have dropped in $100
 
00:37:09.069 --> 00:37:09.079 align:start position:0%
million um we have we have a very strong
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
part uh partnership with lonza and and
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
they have provided some funding for
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
equipment we also um over at Keen um I'm
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're aware so there's
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
I think there are six companies in the
 
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.550 align:start position:0%
I think there are six companies in the
madok

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
madok
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
region forgive me if I get the words
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
mixed up
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
Diamond turning
 
00:37:30.319 --> 00:37:32.109 align:start position:0%
Diamond turning
Precision

00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
Precision
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
Optics um believe it or not the world
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
leader in that equipment being produced
 
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
in the manad
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
region and um Keen state has through
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
some federal support has um just opened
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
a diamond the Optics manufacturing lab
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
and um some of the businesses in the
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
Mano region have provided the equipment
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and so now there will be a
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
certificate start with a certificate and
 
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
then grow to an undergraduate program as
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
a pipeline from Keen State into into
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
industry okay slide
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
10 um I I tried to anticipate questions
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
obviously I didn't anticipate them all
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
because I have some takeaways but um so
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
recent and ongoing actions from um
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
Washington um I wanted to just touch on
 
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
some how we're monitoring those and what
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
that's looking like so Dei related we um
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
are working our general counsel is
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
working closely with all of our campuses
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
right there are executive orders
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
relative to Dei initiatives and there
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
was also I think it was on February 17th
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
um it's being called a dear colleague
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
letter that was um issued by the US
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to all k12 and
 
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
highered and so um relative to um Dei
 
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
and hiring and promotions and admissions
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that the university
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
system is compliant with law we are our
 
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
general council's office is working with
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
all of our campuses going through
 
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
websites our programs over 1,200 federal
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
grants we're going through the language
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
we need to again we are compliant with
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
the law we want to make sure that we
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
continue to be C compliant with the law
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
and we are it it's
 
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
um you know the the guidance comes out
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
and then there'll be Court action and so
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
we're monitoring it and I just want to
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
make you aware make you aware of that
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
and then also with um federal grants as
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
I said the um we have $222 million in
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
federal direct and indirect federal
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
dollars coming in in fiscal 24 and well
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
plus another 22 million
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
impel as of last
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
Friday um we had received stop work
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
orders on four federal grants a total
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
$700,000 um and then after um I finish
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
this I got um a word that there was also
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
a food safety award that won't be
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
renewed and the New Hampshire Department
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture made us aware of that um
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
there was also so why should we
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
care with if there are significant
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
reductions in federal indirect cost or
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
direct cost that could definitely have
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
an impact on the level of research that
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
we're conducting it could have an impact
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
on jobs and Innovation and all of that
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
so we're monitoring it and again we will
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
do what everything we need to do to
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are compliant with
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
law it's great to hear that could you
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
not necessarily right now but could you
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
provide specifics as to what you've
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
actually done regarding the Dei with
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
what your general council is working on
 
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
what what has he actually accomplished
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
sure and a question I would have there
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
is have you simply renamed positions
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
done things of that nature
 
00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:28.670 align:start position:0%
done things of that nature
rather

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
rather
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
than dealing with
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
the goal of what the administration has
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
been requesting um no we haven't ramed
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
anything can let's go to slide 11 I I
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to um I wanted to take this head
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
on because I know it's it's on people's
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
minds and I want to get any information
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
for you um that I don't or can't provide
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
this morning but I know this is top of
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
mind so I want to talk about
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
Dei related and what that means and um I
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
think it's important
 
00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:04.820 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.190 align:start position:0%
that we
[Music]

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
all the tricky part is defining what is
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
Dei because I'll tell you across the
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
university system we spend about $3
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
million on what we call De in our Dei
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
offices or Dei related but that
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
includes services for um students
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
support services for students with
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities student support services
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
for veterans it includes
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
required compliance for Title 9 and
 
00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
Ada and um employment law so when I say
 
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.589 align:start position:0%
Ada and um employment law so when I say
$3

00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
$3
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
million like what do we Define like what
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
do I need to parse out how are we going
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
to Define what is
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
Dei so
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
it it's we don't have an office that's
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to support services based on
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
race we don't have an office like that
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's an office that provides
 
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:13.559 align:start position:0%
different supports to all kinds of
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
different students I will also say that
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
all of these any program that we
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
have is available to all students right
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
we don't have programs that only you can
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
participate in this or only you can
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
participate in that we we do actually
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
even before The Supreme Court ruling
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
student versus Harvard I think that that
 
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.069 align:start position:0%
student versus Harvard I think that that
banned

00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
banned
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
um race and admissions New Hampshire's
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
had a law on that for a long time we
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
don't base admissions on race and and
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
um even that I was reading the dear
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
colleague letter that I referred to and
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
it said um institutions can't have
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
different housing for different students
 
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
or different graduation ceremonies we've
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
never done anything like that we don't
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
have separate housing or separate
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
graduation um Ceremonies for different
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
types of students so
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
um I I'll I'll stop there and let let
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
you folks ask any questions right
 
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
Joy can you explain to me naen Petty's
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
position because this to me looks like
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
diversity inclusion and so Equity so
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
naen is the CH her title is Chief
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
diversity officer at
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
UNH but under
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
her work portfolio if you will are all
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
of these program
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
the the Civil Rights office that
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
investigates compliance with Title 9 and
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
Ada and and employment law also under
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
her is are are the services
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
for oh I just looked at this the other
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
day I think there are five employees for
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
services for students with disabilities
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
we have American Sign Language
 
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
interpreters we have um special needs
 
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
counselors right for for students with
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities as well as veterans now
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
also programs there are student Affinity
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
groups that anyone can join but there
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
could be a student affinity group of
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
different religions a h or
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
um uh African-Americans anyone can join
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
those but but student you know will have
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
there are Affinity groups on campus so
 
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.230 align:start position:0%
there are Affinity groups on campus so
her

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
portfolio does
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
include diversity programming But it
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
more represent
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
papovich just to continue in the same
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
line thank you again um under
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
represented student populations can you
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
expand on that a little certainly those
 
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
those might include students of
 
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.230 align:start position:0%
those might include students of
color

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
color
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
um that could include LGBT
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
students um any any unrepresented group
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
right at the end of the day support is
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
good right once somebody's admitted they
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
got to have the necessary tools to
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
survive and some of the groups may have
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
different needs you know first
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
generation College goers may not have
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
had the same family support and so on so
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
right support for underrepresented
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
student population is one thing
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
you know are you saying that there is no
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
impact on the odds of somebody being
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
admitted to UNH because they belong to
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
an underrepresented student
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
population I I would argue that we do
 
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
not admit someone to UNH or Plymouth or
 
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
Keane because they are a member of an
 
00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.190 align:start position:0%
Keane because they are a member of an
unrepresented

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
unrepresented
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
group well that's to say you're not
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
admitting them so because that I I hear
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
you what weight would belonging to an
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
underrepresented student population what
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
process again
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative I would argue it has no
 
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
weight and and I will also
 
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.270 align:start position:0%
weight and and I will also
say

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
um you know we are not
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
Harvard we accept if if if you meet um
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
educational requirements we have a seat
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
for you we have more capacity than we
 
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
need right now
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
so it it wouldn't matter what group you
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
belong to we would welcome you to to
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
institutions another question that
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
unrelated to students though what about
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
Staffing that would be against the law
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
hire our employees based on whether or
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
not they're in an
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
unrepresented group so I I don't know
 
00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
who this naen person is I'd rather use
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
her last name I'm guessing that's her
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
first name but does the chief diversity
 
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
officer have any responsibility for
 
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
employees or is it is her responsibility
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
strictly related to students I assume
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
it's a her sorry if I'm wrong well no um
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely there there there would be
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
some employees because you could have um
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
you could have accusations of bias or
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
you could have
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
employees um who have been harassed or
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
th you know those types of
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
Investigations would be under her her
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
purview I will also say that
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
um you know during hiring we want to
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that's not happening happening
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
that that people aren't being hired
 
00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:32.839 align:start position:0%
solely because they belong to one group
 
00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
or another so her office could get
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
involved in that that to ensure that we
 
00:49:37.839 --> 00:49:39.430 align:start position:0%
involved in that that to ensure that we
are

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
compliant thank
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
you yeah thinkk you you just happen to
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
say solely because um solely would be a
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
heck of a high standard
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
right but as I asked you earlier solely
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
is one thing part is
 
00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
another so I hear the solely can you
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
comment on any weight that belonging to
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
again under represented employee
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
populations may have in hiring
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
decisions I don't believe that's the
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
case representative but I will go back
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
and ask that question I don't believe
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
that's the case thank you um and a
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
one of the practices that I read and I
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
will say that I have I'm not aware of
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
whether this is the case with the UNH
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
system or not is that certain
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
universities seem to consider that uh
 
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
Dei was so important that any new
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
employee had to agree with di principles
 
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:48.799 align:start position:0%
to get hired and sign a statement or
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
affirm a commitment to those standards
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
could you comment on whether UNH has any
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
such requirement where an employee has
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
to agree to certain beliefs to get a job
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
no that is not the case I will say under
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
the so we
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
just in December we went to a new HR
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
Finance system under the old
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
system UNH would have in the job posting
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
that an um an applicant was to complete
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
a diversity state
 
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
statement that the you know H how do you
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
Embrace inclusion of all people that
 
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
that type of thing in the new system
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
that is not that is no longer hardwired
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
into a uh that is no longer part of an a
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
job posting at
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
UNH I appreciate the evolution into a
 
00:51:49.799 --> 00:51:51.150 align:start position:0%
UNH I appreciate the evolution into a
better

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
Direction so is it obviously being
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
removed from the list of prerequisites
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
is good
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
is it something that still still may get
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
asked or talked about during interviews
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
or in the process of
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
hiring I I don't believe so I I suppose
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
if a hiring
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
manager thought that was important uh
 
00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.789 align:start position:0%
manager thought that was important uh
inclusion

00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
inclusion
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
uh that that might be used and if that
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
happens is that documented that it was
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
yes I don't know that would yes I
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and look I I know that
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
some of these questions may involve
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
information you may not have at your
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
fingertips so I appreciate that you're
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
giving me the best information you have
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
right now but please if you come across
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
in you know data later that indicate
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
that some of this may be slightly
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
different than what you can recall right
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
now please uh don't wait for further
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
questions from us just let us know if
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
you become aware of any changes of on
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
that Absa absolutely repres Murray thank
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
you can we go back to some of the
 
00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
questions on
 
00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:08.839 align:start position:0%
enrollment um can you uh you had a small
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
increase um recently and but overall
 
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
there's been the decline can you par out
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
the difference between undergraduate and
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
graduate with the numbers you're here
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
are they all undergraduate students
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
because I'd be curious to see if there's
 
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
an increase in graduate students who are
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
coming graduate has has um um across the
 
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
system has remained fairly flat the
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
reason being um Plymouth State used to
 
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
have so it's it's increased at UNH but
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
it's come down intentionally at Plymouth
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
State Plymouth State used to have a
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
um quite a few uh graduate students and
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
but um it was
 
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
not I know our entire being isn't about
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
making money but it wasn't generating
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
dollars for Plymouth and so over time
 
00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
Plymouth has reduced its graduate
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
programs so as a system we've remained
 
00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
fairly St we have remained stable on The
 
00:54:09.319 --> 00:54:14.430 align:start position:0%
fairly St we have remained stable on The
Graduate

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
side represent
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
envelops thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
you uh for um being here today and
 
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
sharing some more information with us um
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little bit concerned about U
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
the federal grants and the current
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
um I guess you would call it executive
 
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
order directives that um the indirect
 
00:54:40.349 --> 00:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
Grant dollars might be capped um for
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
instance I've had this conversation with
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
private institution in my district uh
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
about their concern um and they were
 
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
able to calculate um the type of funding
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
that they might lose if the indirect cap
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
were to go into place I'm just wondering
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
if usnh has also calculated the loss and
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
if you can quantify that for us sure now
 
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.630 align:start position:0%
if you can quantify that for us sure now
the

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
um I don't think this was an executive
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
order I I believe it was a letter from
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
the NIH I think you're right ni is
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
National Institutes of Health and so we
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
calculated on the NIH it would be about
 
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.039 align:start position:0%
a million dollar loss the university
 
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
system doesn't have big big dollars with
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
the NIH like probably Dartmouth does um
 
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
but of the amounts that we receive from
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
the National Institute of instit NIH um
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
it would be about a million dollars of
 
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.589 align:start position:0%
it would be about a million dollars of
indirect

00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
indirect
 
00:55:41.309 --> 00:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
cost that would come from but it you
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
so okay um one moment repres Kelly
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you thank you for being here
 
00:55:56.029 --> 00:55:56.039 align:start position:0%
today um on slide eight you talk about
 
00:55:59.470 --> 00:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
the relationship between UNH and Noah so
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there do you foresee
 
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
any uh disruption in that relationship
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
or harm being done from what's
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
being done so no
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
um on March as of March 3D we have not
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
received that there will be um any
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
significant pullback of of Noah dollars
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
and and the university does have it's
 
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
another um
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
you know UNH is one of the world leaders
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
in Ocean mapping working with um with
 
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
Noah but no we aren't aware at this time
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
any you're good go ahead thank you sorry
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
my last slide is um slide 12 again uh I
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier highed is changing
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
um it it's a tough business here in New
 
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
England um but the mission is second to
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
none it's important that um we partner
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
to deliver on the the future needs of of
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
our state's Workforce and our state's
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
economy and our quality of life um there
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
will be difficult there are and will be
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
more difficult decisions um in the
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
future and again we respectfully request
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
that the governor's recommended funding
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
level of that um 8% reduction be be held
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
for the University system and that it
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
not be reduced any further and and just
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
um I provide we provided um some
 
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
appendix slides and those we already
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
provide those were from the orientation
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
you the the committee had asked for
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
followup at the orientation we sent that
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
material to Mickey right after the
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
meeting but I thought I'd include those
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
here um for your information and I'll
 
00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
will also provide this um you know
 
00:57:58.589 --> 00:57:58.599 align:start position:0%
electronically to Mickey so that that
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
you have it you don't have to have a
 
00:57:59.799 --> 00:58:00.950 align:start position:0%
you have it you don't have to have a
hard

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
hard
 
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
copy thank
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray hold on yeah
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
just one more thing the um the 95
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
million for 2025 the anticipated is how
 
00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
close to that is that real um I know
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
we're still in the middle I know it's
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
anticipated um but my question is
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
there's just a what about three and a
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
half million difference between that and
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
the request for this year um I would go
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
on the record to say that I would love
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
to see us come up with the 95 million um
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
that you are anticipating in 2025 just
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
my view on the support for the
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
University system in
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
2025 yeah the anticipated is is that the
 
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
right way isn't that this year I I yes I
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard it's being reduced for
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
2025 yeah so that 20 that 20 fiscal 25
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
95 million that's what's currently
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
budgeted already appropriated right I
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
haven't heard that's being reduced no
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
but it's not no no but I would like to
 
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
see the next bium support that amount to
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
continue huh 26 27 yes I would like to
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
see 26 we would very much sure very much
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
like to see the flat funding but but
 
00:59:19.029 --> 00:59:19.039 align:start position:0%
again we also acknowledge that you know
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
I I understand the lay of the land but
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific that's you know
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just want to to for the record put
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
that out there that I would like to see
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
the flat funding continue thank you
 
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
representative papovich thank you Mr
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
chair while we are in the for the record
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
territory a couple of topics I wanted to
 
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
briefly address not as much questions
 
00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
but thoughts I'd like to share with you
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
to understand at least where I'm coming
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
from right I appreciate the effort to
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
keep tuition flat we've been doing that
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
for a long time problem is that if you
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
keep it flat forever it gets closer and
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
closer to free every year I mean
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
technically this $100 we make every
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
every year used to be 6 months of wages
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
and now it's 27 cents a day of course
 
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking a couple of you know a few
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
more years than we kept to ising flat
 
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
but the point is I understand that we
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
needed to do that for a while to become
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
more competitive with other states I
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
just want to State on the record that
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
this type of policy cannot be sustained
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
permanently and there are reasons why we
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
are looking to adjust it and whatnot in
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable ways and keeping an eye to
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
all those factors so again in the for
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
the record territory the other for the
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
comment is in regards to your
 
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
endowment I completely agree that you
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
need to have the discipline to continue
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
to grow it I I I would just suggest that
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
you keep in mind that we should
 
01:00:39.309 --> 01:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
continuously reexamine the expected
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
growth rates versus the amount of uh
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
money we are planning to you know draw
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
out of the endowment because we need to
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
balance the focus on growth with the
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
need to serve our current students there
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
are other colleges privates that have
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
gone on a rather ridiculous path where
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
they accumulated in their endowments
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
more money than they need to pay for the
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
tuition of every student that will ever
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
attend the college and they keep asking
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
for more endowments I'm not saying you
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
are planning to go in that direction I'm
 
01:01:11.549 --> 01:01:11.559 align:start position:0%
just saying that we really need to find
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
that middle ground between those two and
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
I would really appreciate it if you guys
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
continued looking at it without us
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
needing to remind you and pro you about
 
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
it I know that you do but you know it's
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
important again for certain things to be
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
said on the record as as far as I'm
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
concerned and I'm done in slightly less
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
than probably the forecasted time so
 
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.470 align:start position:0%
than probably the forecasted time so
thank

01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
questions um so a couple
 
01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
more probably you get back to what kind
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
of things um how much State support from
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
our capital budget has the universe
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
received over the past five years on on
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
an annual basis and how about State
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
contracts over that same period of
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
time and I'm
 
01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
looking at the state the the budget
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
document here the one page thing is it
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
possible to get something that's kind of
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
in between this and the state our state
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
budget in terms of detail something a
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
little more detailed than this but
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be quite what the
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
governor provided and ideally as an
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
actual spreadsheet I mean
 
01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet document not as something
 
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
that looks like a
 
01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:20.039 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet would be great go
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
ahead so more more detail than we
 
01:02:27.269 --> 01:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
provided not as much detail is yeah I
 
01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
again I'm leaving to your judgment but
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
something maybe by department but you
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
know something
 
01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:35.559 align:start position:0%
between what this is and what the state
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
provides now granted the state is very
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
detailed so I'm not looking for that
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
right but something that maybe gives
 
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
better idea of what's going on inside
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
the institution as opposed to this is
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
kind of like a balance sheet for a COR
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
top Corporation if you go to slide
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
so you'd like to see by department at
 
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.470 align:start position:0%
so you'd like to see by department at
each

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
institution I will give you the
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
flexibility to decide how you want to do
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
it okay okay but clearly you are as a
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
former Treasurer former everything
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
you've done you're well aware of ranges
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
of detail that could be divided in a
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
budget and maybe somewhere between
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
other questions no we good at the risk
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
of eating into my friend we'll let her
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
we'll let her go along too um I usually
 
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
like to um recap so I'm not missing
 
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
anything that that the committee has
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
asked for so we are going to get
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
administrative salary administrative
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
salaries over the that that fiveyear
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
change 19 to 24 we're going to break it
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
out by Grant versus non-grant and per
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
student and as compensation as well as
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
headcount okay um we're also going to
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
provide um Benchmark of a endowment
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
payout rates with peer
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
institutions um we're going I'm going to
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
check with General Counsel on what's
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
actually been done related to the work
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
that that they are doing with our
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
campuses on grants and websites and
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
programs um I'm going to
 
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
confirm that we're not hiring employees
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
based on what group they belong to
 
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
whether partially or
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
solely um okay hang on I got the flat
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
tuition endowment payout we talked about
 
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
um State
 
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
support from on the capital side over
 
01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
the P why don't we go six years because
 
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
that's the bi anyal that'll be three by
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
Anum more the marrier state
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
contracts and more detail
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
budget any other items that she missed
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
sound pretty thorough to me great thank
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%

good morning we appreciate the
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
committee's time this morning we were
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
here within the last few weeks focused a
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
lot of that conversation on Mission the
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
core work that we do in serving students
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
from our early college and Workforce
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
programs to our degree and certificate
 
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
programs we're here today primarily to
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
talk about finance and we'll touch on
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
anything else that the committee would
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
like to hear about so move relatively
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
quickly through the
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
three the governor aot frankly was very
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
kind to us in the budget particularly in
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
the context that we know other state
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
agencies other other entities faced in
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
the midst of fiscal challenges for the
 
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:51.799 align:start position:0%
state but did want to start out just by
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh addressing something that I think has
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
been at least a little bit misunder
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
stood at least by some in the
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
media um in comparing the current bium
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
2425 with the governor's proposal for
 
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
2627 on paper it looks like a
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
significant increase to be honest we'd
 
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
be grateful to have just held even but
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that that's
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
important to note about the current bium
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we're in is that Governor sonunu
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
put significant funding in House Bill 2
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
that isn't necessarily Apples to Apples
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
when you account for funding for
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce early college and for a
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
promise program that's a total of about
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
$10 million that showed up in House Bill
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
2 in the last panium that's now built
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
fully into Governor aot's proposed House
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
Bill one budget so it's still about a
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
million and a half net favorable and
 
01:08:47.789 --> 01:08:47.799 align:start position:0%
again in the challenging Financial
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances the state has we're we're
 
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
grateful but I do want to I did want to
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
address what I think is at least some
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
confusion that some in the media have
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
have discerned in looking at the
 
01:08:59.759 --> 01:09:09.510 align:start position:0%
have discerned in looking at the
governor's

01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
budget one of the best things about
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
having good colleagues is that you've
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
got a coach and Angel on your shoulder
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
remind you what you should do while
 
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
you're here um I I I'll note that that a
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
couple of layers of detail in Governor
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
sununu's budget one thing that did find
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
its way into house bill one was a
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
million and a quarter each year to
 
01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
support tuition assistance for students
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
pursuing early childhood
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
education the the argument at the time
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
that we made was that there are a number
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
of Grant programs to support early
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
childhood education students but they
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
were a patchwork and they left a lot of
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
gaps and in discussing this with our
 
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
faculty who teach in those programs what
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
they said is when those grants don't
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
cover something students typically step
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
back compensation in that field is not
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
great and so for students to incur the
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
expense or the debt that comes with
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
borrowing for that was a barrier
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
governor sonunu was kind enough to put
 
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
that in and when we spoke with Governor
 
01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
aot earlier what we had said is that if
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
our budget could be held flat we would
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we would treat that same
 
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
million and a quarter a year to be
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
available for Early Child education we
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
we continue to think that that's a
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
worthwhile investment for the
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
state u a couple of the other pieces can
 
01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
I just to clarify something so are you
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the governor's budget is
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
flat with your current
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
budget and I'm just looking at the topl
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
line numbers here that's why I'm asking
 
01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.709 align:start position:0%
line numbers here that's why I'm asking
that

01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
question net of things that were either
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
in house bill one or two I think we're
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
about 1.5 million up over the
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
bium maybe I misunderstand your
 
01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet here but it looks like
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're including all of hb2 and hb1 and
 
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
everything am I miss reading right what
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
what I saying is that in Governor
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
sununu's budget much of this was in
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 in Governor aot's proposed
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
budget it's all in house bill one so
 
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
when you look at just House Bill one
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
across the two Bia you end up with what
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
looks like a significant difference of
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
about $10 million most of that is moving
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
things that had been in House Bill 2
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
into house bill one okay maybe I
 
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding what you're displaying
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
here so we're we're on slide three
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
correct correct and across the top you
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
see numbers like 66 million 63 million
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
for the current Bion name and then 69
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
and 70 and then down below under the 24
 
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
actual 25 adjusted authorized you see
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
the things I think you're referring to
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
that are in hb2 are those not included
 
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
in your sums at the top is that what
 
01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
you're telling me no what I'm in in
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
house in in the current bium those were
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
not I'm if I could explain maybe a
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
slightly different way um in the the two
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
left-hand columns the blue shaded
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
columns FY 24 and FY 25 there's a house
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
one number which is the Topline number
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
and to that was
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
added the the amounts that are kind of
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
below where it says houseal 2 included
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
in basically the third row so if you
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
took all those and put and and added
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
them into the Topline number they would
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
be closer to what you see as a topl line
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
number in FY 26 and 27 so the hb2
 
01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
numbers even though they're displayed
 
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
here at the bottom you did not include
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
them in the top line number
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay my apology one more good reason to
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
have a teammate with you
 
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so um just moving on then if there
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
were no additional questions just to
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
note that on slide four uh both the
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
Early College proposal and the math
 
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
learning communities are actually
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
subjects of separate legislation that's
 
01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
house on Slide Five House Bill
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
25 at this point we have uh
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
$700,000 in the governor's budget
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
specifically for being able to relocate
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
a welding program currently from a
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
facility that we are leasing in
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
Rochester to the camp the Great Bay
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
Community College's permanent location
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
in at peas um we had we had requested
 
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
about $17 million for a range of of
 
01:13:24.679 --> 01:13:25.709 align:start position:0%
about $17 million for a range of of
things

01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance Energy Systems it
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
Renovations the first thing you
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned doesn't seem to appear here
 
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
you mentioned something in hb1 in the
 
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
governor's budget $700,000 for
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
something that's um we included SL five
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
which is about house 25 which I know
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
isn't specifically the purview of this
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
committee y but the point the point is
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
to say that in hille 25 we currently
 
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.550 align:start position:0%
to say that in hille 25 we currently
have

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
an appropriation of
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
$700,000 for the the welding purpose
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
that the chancellor described which is
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
not here correct which which is not here
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't it wasn't actually one
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
of our original requests it's something
 
01:14:07.229 --> 01:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
that came up kind of later in the
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
process um but none of the capital funds
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
that we had actually requested back last
 
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
fall when this process starts were
 
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
funded in hospit 25 so the point of that
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
is that we will need to find a way to
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
support our it infrastructure upgrade
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
needs our critical
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance Capital maintenance um and
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
whatever other Capital work we need to
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
do U we'll need to find ways to do that
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
without using Capital funds so this is
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a a a draw in one way or
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
another on our operating budget for the
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
next bayum so requested 17 million
 
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
didn't receive it did not receive any of
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
that 17 million receive $700,000 for
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
unrelated yes items thank you you you
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
may know the capital budget uh timetable
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
starts quite early well in advance of
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
the the budget year so the the welding
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
issue is something that came up after we
 
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
had developed and submitted our capital
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
budget request we brought it forward in
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
the governor's phase and it was
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
something that the governor um decided
 
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
to include in the capital budget but
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
nothing else that we
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
requested um had been included in the
 
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
governor's capital
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
budget thank you thank
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
you um I'll I'll just move to slide
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
seven um and and just briefly as I said
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
we're primarily here to talk about
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
Finance but does not hurt to to uh share
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
reminder of what our focus is these are
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
credentials for The Last 5 Years and
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
still work in progress for the current
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
year um shows a high concentration of
 
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
our programs in healthc care in
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
particular as well as transfer Focus
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
programs in Liberal Arts sciences and
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
business and then a range of other
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
programs supporting manufacturing
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
construction and so forth so just wanted
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
to highlight the the landscape there
 
01:15:58.510 --> 01:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
this does not include our
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships nor does it include our
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
boot camps many of which have a
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
particular focus in advanced and
 
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.950 align:start position:0%
particular focus in advanced and
precision

01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.629 --> 01:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
manufacturing so turn turning to slide
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
eight and
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
finances this is general fund
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh House Bill one
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
essentially over the last three by any
 
01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
including the one we're currently in and
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
as as I've said before grateful for what
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
has been uh growth and support from the
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
state on behalf of our
 
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
students you'll note in particular that
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
the last bium uh significant uptick from
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
2223 into
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
2425 specifically the request that we
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
had made to help us keep tuition flat
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
for students the state has been an
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
extraordinary partner for the community
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
college system for more than a decade
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
and has allowed us to keep tuition
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
virtually flat through that entire time
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
we are still among the most expensive
 
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
Community College systems in the country
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
but we haven't lost ground and in fact
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
over time as the federal government has
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
invested more in pel Grants a student
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
who is now fully pel eligible can cover
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
the cost of the community college system
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
with that Grant something that wasn't
 
01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:19.719 align:start position:0%
true a decade ago when that student
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
would have still needed to find $2,000 a
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
year to pay 430 credits so we're
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
grateful for
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
that as you shift to the next slide
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
slide nine before you leave that just
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
tell us what a restricted ECE is the
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
orange bars that's the early childhood
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
education that one and a quarter off the
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
top thank you you're welcome so a as I
 
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
shift to slide nine which shows the
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
pattern of tuition fees the first thing
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
you'll notice from 20 to 21 is that
 
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.830 align:start position:0%
you'll notice from 20 to 21 is that
sharp

01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
sharp
 
01:17:56.189 --> 01:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
downturn through the p pmic community
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
colleges across the country in the two
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
years where the pandemic was most
 
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
evident had about an 18% drop in
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment our students who are often
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
again are demographic typically working
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
adults parents who suddenly became the
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
homeschooled Zoom parent in the home
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
classroom all of those reasons our
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
enrollment fell during that time so
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
tuition Revenue fell over time what
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see what might look like
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
relatively flat tuition please keep in
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
mind that this is also a product of the
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
state having made an investment to allow
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
us to keep tuition flat so that even as
 
01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
enrollment was growing it was being
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
absorbed no additional cost to students
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the last two years we've seen 3 and
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
4% year-over-year growth is not
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily reflected in the tuition but
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
it is an illustration of the way supply
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
and demand is supposed to work by
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
keeping costs and more affordable for
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
students it's allowed more students to
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
progress um and the 25 figure is still
 
01:18:58.990 --> 01:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary we expect that there'll be
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
more growth again reflecting
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
year-over-year increase in enrollment
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
flat slide 10 just some illustrations of
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
the key elements of non-tuition Revenue
 
01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh you'll notice in particular um
 
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
the gry bar's non-credit activity this
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
is an area where Governor sonunu made an
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
investment where Governor aot has
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
proposed to make an investment what
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see is we're starting to see the
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
return on that investment notably in the
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
current year these are non-credit
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
training programs in health care and
 
01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:49.639 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing in areas where seed money
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
made available from the state for those
 
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
programs has allowed us to deliver them
 
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
um and somewhat entrepreneurial asking
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
each of the campuses to figure out what
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
the needs were in their region and then
 
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
to deliver programs tailor to Employers
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
areas slide 11 personnel expenses slow
 
01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
down um what happened to
 
01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.070 align:start position:0%
down um what happened to
Grants

01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
Grants
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
so the the anomaly that you're seeing is
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
21 and 22 pandemic era significant
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
infusions of federal money specifically
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
responding to the pandemic for lost
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue I believe turned to coo
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
Fields so th those funds were available
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
for those two years to offset the Lost
 
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
revenue and then have
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
dissipated no understand what they are
 
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
but it looks like they more than offset
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
your loss Revenue that
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
they they did Banner years there it's
 
01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
it's t it's lost tuition but it's also
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
lost auxiliary Revenue so it it it was a
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
c it was a formula calculated to account
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
for what we actually lost we also were
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
able to use um this Federal funding to
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
invest in um technology that we needed
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
to deliver more of our instruction
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
online given the pandemic and so much of
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
our instruction is uh very difficult to
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
deliver online as you can imagine it's
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
Hands-On it's lab laboratory based so um
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
we we receive funding that enabled us to
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
account for some less Revenue but also
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
to invest in enhanced online learning
 
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
technology that still serves us today as
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
we still have a significant part of our
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
enrollment accessing Us online Pap just
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
to add a little bit of color to this
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
discussion the arpa whatever other
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
Federal acronym you want to call them by
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
the funds where meant to be a
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
replacement for loss Revenue but the
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
entities receiving it were only required
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
to match that to revenue losses above a
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
certain level of funding any entity that
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
receives funds under that deadline just
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
took the money and was told it doesn't
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
matter if we gave you more than what you
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
lost it is what it is we are not
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
required to account for it you can just
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
keep the whole thing so I'm assuming
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
that in the case of ccsnh they got more
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
in arpa than the loss Revenue but you
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
know they
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
had the ability to keep that funds and
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
again you as you were saying they used
 
01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
them to fund certain longer term
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
liabilities they were concerned about
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
all of which would be squarely within
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
the scope of the arpa funds and frankly
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
I would rather see you guys use that
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
U you know unexpected Fortune to deal
 
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
with long-term concerns rather than blow
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
it on operational expenses and then not
 
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
have that so I appreciate that but I
 
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
didn't want to provide that color
 
01:22:58.830 --> 01:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
because not everybody in the room may
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
you know have the uh background and it
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
should be on the record thank you thank
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
you and could you also explain other
 
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
operating costs and you don't have any
 
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
projections here for 26 and
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
27 under operating revenue or
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
expense um I'm are we still on slide
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
10 or did I get under the wrong slide
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
operating it's not a trick
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
question sorry about that Scott Field's
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
Chief Operating Officer the for the
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
system when you had just uh said other
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
operating you said expense and I think
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's where the confusion came from so
 
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
this other operating Revenue other
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
operating that's exactly I apologize
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
wrong word no that's okay so I'm sorry
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
what was the question what is it oh what
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
oh it includes a number of different
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
things if you think of uh bookstore
 
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
commissions interest uh Revenue things
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
of that nature so it's a lot of smaller
 
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
buckets that are put into one for the
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
sake of the chart to for clarity so did
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
great in
 
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
24 what happened in
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
25 in and do you expect it to go back up
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
in 26 27 I don't see any numbers here
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
you know any projections for the coming
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
by any so we're in the middle of our
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
budget creation process for 26 and 27 so
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have forecasts yet for the
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
upcoming bium that said if we look at um
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
there was a significant increase in
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
unrealized gains in 24 that go into this
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
number as well as part of our as in
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
stock market type gains you we have yes
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
we have funds that are invested to
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
offset um operating cost as well as look
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
at long-term liabilities okay that's
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
great so you say you're in the middle of
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
your budgeting
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
correct yes yes this is what we talking
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
about though isn't it
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
yes so you must have some Revenue
 
01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
projections or you must be be able to
 
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
divide those to us we're working with
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
the colleges as they develop their
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
enrollment projections for the 2627 bium
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
so as they go through that process we
 
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
look at non-credit Revenue we look at um
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
other operating income like interest uh
 
01:25:19.109 --> 01:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
interest revenue from our investments
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
pulling that all together we're actually
 
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
working towards getting data together to
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
bring to our board
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
in April okay thank you repres while you
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
are here thank you um I did want to come
 
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
back to one of my uh favorite topics
 
01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:37.119 align:start position:0%
which is that I really appreciate
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
getting the you know numbers going from
 
01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
one year to the other but it would be
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
nice when we are provided with those
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
variations if without having to ask next
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
time we'd get a basic variance analysis
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
just color commentary on exactly what
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
you are asked about hey how come that
 
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
the other operating went from three to
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
five and then now to four right I mean
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
this type of stuff honestly I know that
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
this may not have been the way things
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
were done in the past
 
01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
but it seems like a very basic type of
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
document to have that would be
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
appreciated going forward and trust me
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'm asking this of everyone it's not you
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
the other thing too and I I'm trying to
 
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
understand right cuz what the chairman
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
Earth was saying earlier I'm trying to
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
understand the timing of your forecasts
 
01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.189 align:start position:0%
understand the timing of your forecasts
right

01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
because I don't know how I budget if I
 
01:26:30.669 --> 01:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
don't have a revenue budget versus the
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
you know expenditures budget right so
 
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
finalize all the state side of the
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
budgets in what a month
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
plus it seems to be difficult to do that
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
without having any inkling of what the
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
forecast may be for your you know
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
operate operating years I understand
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
that forecast get refined with new data
 
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
all the time but you should be able to
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
provide provide some sort of whatever
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
internal forecast you have even
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
understanding it may not be as great as
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
you may have it so we'd appreciate it if
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
you'd look into just giving us some
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
insight into how you see that going with
 
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
the information you have right now
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day we have
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
what one more month something to
 
01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
finalize this for us so we cannot wait
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
for it to be perfect no understood and I
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
think part of as we're going through our
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
process internally with some of the
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
variability from what the state may come
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
back with that means a lot to us we more
 
01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
than 50% of our gross revenue comes from
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
the state that you know
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
small heel back could mean a significant
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
operational change for some of our
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
colleges so we I think we were waiting
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
for some of that to come through as we
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
then finalized it if that's something
 
01:27:46.109 --> 01:27:46.119 align:start position:0%
were to change now I'm confused I was
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
talking about the forecast on
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
revenues not about the budget the
 
01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
costs we will be back with with what you
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
requested we'll bring you preliminary
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
forecasts it would be much appreciated
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
again understanding they're not fully
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
finalized and all forecasts are subject
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
to being an educated guest and all that
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you proceed okay so on on
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
slide 11 personnel expenses the the the
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
notable piece of analysis here that
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's perhaps
 
01:28:25.109 --> 01:28:25.119 align:start position:0%
helpful this includes Grant funded
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
positions and although our grant
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
portfolio is somewhat smaller than the
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
University Systems by an order of
 
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
magnitude um in 2015 we had two Grant
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
funded positions uh in 20202 it was 16
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's currently
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
41 so we've had a significant growth in
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
Grant funded positions primarily
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
supporting our apprenticeship New
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire work through the US Department
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
of Labor that in fact probably pushes up
 
01:28:58.030 --> 01:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
the Personnel lines that otherwise would
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
be down over a period of
 
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
time it might be nice if you could
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
actually break those out then we will
 
01:29:04.239 --> 01:29:12.550 align:start position:0%
actually break those out then we will
bring

01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
that um slide 12 facilities expense just
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
illustration of what we've been uh
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
investing in annually uh for maintenance
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
and uh transfers of equipment over
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
5,000 our board over the last few years
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
has expressed an interest in seeing each
 
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
of the colleges and the system begin to
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
elevate the pace at which we're
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
investing in that simultaneously as you
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
heard from my counterpart Chancellor
 
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
preventure we've been evaluating our
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
foot our footprint trying to figure out
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
what physical infrastructure we actually
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
need for the future versus things that
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
we've we've had for years that may no
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
purpose um and then slide one represent
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
Murray I'm sorry I just what's the
 
01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
equipment so transfers of equipment
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
is if they come in for equipment yeah
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
for equipment as they come in over a
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
certain dollar amount that then transfer
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
it it's just it's our internal language
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
sorry it's it's then transferred into uh
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
Capital asset areas within our budget
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
so it's things that could I'm sorry go
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
ahead I still don't know what that means
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
oh equipment could be anything from uh
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
an air handler unit HVAC it could be uh
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
facilities equipment to front end loader
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
things of that nature so it could be
 
01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's all encompassing of what could
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
be purchased my I'm not doing a good job
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
of explaining so it's transferring an
 
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
additional cost of what something you
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
bought something at costom War so you
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
have to transfer money in order to pay
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
for that thing I'm still do you know
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
well it it's differentiating small
 
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
purchases from larger purchases
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
something above $5,000 we categorize
 
01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
differently just for budgeting purposes
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
and then gets capitalized over
 
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
time okay so so it's the way they
 
01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:11.719 align:start position:0%
account for it yes when they're when
 
01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
they're buying small stuff they can
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
expense it when they're buying big stuff
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
they've got to capitalize it or amortize
 
01:31:19.709 --> 01:31:19.719 align:start position:0%
it in the case of software thank
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome glad I got offer some
 
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
help not only
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
questions and then SL slide 13 just a
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
categorization of major operating
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
expenses other than personnel and and
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
Facilities over time U as you can see
 
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
there's a large bucket that's described
 
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
as other operating expense so going back
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
to a previous slide in the question that
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
came uh fortunately Co Fields was wise
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
enough to anticipate the question and
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
has described what mostly is comprised
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
bucket but there's no sub buckets in
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
there that are also substantially Rel
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know I mean well the other ones like
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
for instance your financial expenses you
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
know a relatively small bucket are there
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
a bunch of financial expense type things
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
in the big bucket that could be broken
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
out or is it really just a bunch of
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
random things so again the the second
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
bullet on the slide says that roughly
 
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
50% is attributable to Consumer
 
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
consumable lab supplies office supplies
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
and minor equipment and some so yes to
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
answer your question there are sub
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
buckets within the other expense
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
category if you were to break them all
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
out they would look much smaller like
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
much smaller than financial they'
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
probably be about the same size and the
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
so in respect to the landscape of the
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
the sheet we put them all to I put them
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
all together to just make it easier I
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
can certainly provide that information
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
broken out if the committee would like
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet would be amazing oh there
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
overview questions from the
 
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
committee is that a note or is that you
 
01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.470 align:start position:0%
committee is that a note or is that you
want

01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Murray yeah uh
 
01:33:27.149 --> 01:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um just you touched on this
 
01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
before but um it's a area where it pulls
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
at my heart a little bit here um I
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
really support you know your early the
 
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
training for early childhood education
 
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
as well as the training for nursing um I
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
get stuck uh when salaries are still not
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
they're not paid they go through all
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
this and I really appreciate that they
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
can do this without going into debt but
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
then they go out into the world and
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
they're not earning a livable wage and I
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
know there's really nothing you can do
 
01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
about that except advocate for it but
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's a frustration for me to train
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
people to do something and then we have
 
01:34:02.189 --> 01:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
a culture a society that doesn't value
 
01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
it enough to give them a livable wage so
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
just my being my crank for the
 
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
day you always need at least
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
one other rubs and pack and fups uh
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this might actually
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
be from Mickey um I'm looking at the hb2
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
Dual and concurrent enrollment
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
program um Section 1 of hb2 on page 46 I
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
remember our last discussion was that um
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
if HB 193 had passed that we could
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
possibly take this out of
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
hb2 um even though there is no fiscal
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
impact um and I know it did pass the
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
house I believe with Amendment on
 
01:34:43.229 --> 01:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
February 13th I'm just wondering does
 
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
the house position is that enough for us
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
to take it out or does it stay how does
 
01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:50.149 align:start position:0%
to take it out or does it stay how does
that

01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
work so that we we had talked about this
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
before with a couple other
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
um Provisions that it's been the
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
prerogative of Finance to pass a piece
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
of legislation as part of House Bill 2
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
even though there is a separate bill in
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
the case of this one um you can ask the
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
department or excuse me the uh community
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
college system what their thoughts are
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
on that bill surviving on its own my
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
sense is you probably could take it out
 
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 2 since there is a another
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation uh in the process
 
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
and since that does not have a direct
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
impact to the amount they appropriating
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
but I'll defer to to
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
them I think as long as that language
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
makes it over the Finish Line One Way Or
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
Another We're okay with it happening
 
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.189 align:start position:0%
Another We're okay with it happening
either

01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
way reprenda Murray it it did pass I
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
think overwhelmingly didn't it so I
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
think the only concern is if the Senate
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
might do something and should we hang on
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
to it until we know what the Senate
 
01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
does I mean based
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
on my experience going through this
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
process there's there's a lot that
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
happens between now and the end of
 
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference so I think
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
keeping the language alive maybe in a
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
idea other
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
questions oh well thank you very much
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the committee's time and
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
realize you have hard choices and
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
decisions to make they're grateful for
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
whatever level of support you can
 
01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
sustain for us so thank you we
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time very much as well
 
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.070 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time very much as well
thank

01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
you and with that I'll close the hearing
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
on my hearing is the wrong way
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
11:35 and then do we need anything else
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
to any other committee conversations

03:17:13.469 --> 03:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
statement so the document that I just
 
03:17:14.910 --> 03:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
want to just make everyone aware of I
 
03:17:18.189 --> 03:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
had provided to the committee on the 18
 
03:17:20.070 --> 03:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's just the fishing game fund it's
 
03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
a surplus statement document it's kind
 
03:17:24.389 --> 03:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
of a snapshot in time basically your
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
starting point so um presented or in the
 
03:17:29.229 --> 03:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
Shaded columns is the governor's
 
03:17:31.189 --> 03:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
recommended budget and then in the
 
03:17:32.910 --> 03:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
unshaded columns would be kind of where
 
03:17:34.510 --> 03:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
we are with division two as you start
 
03:17:34.520 --> 03:17:35.510 align:start position:0%
we are with division two as you start
your

03:17:35.510 --> 03:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:17:39.189 --> 03:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
work uh most everything is the same here
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
your starting point is the governor's
 
03:17:42.590 --> 03:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
recommended budget of course the only
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
differences I'll point out is on line
 
03:17:48.429 --> 03:17:48.439 align:start position:0%
three in fiscal year 20 5 the house Ways
 
03:17:50.309 --> 03:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
and Means Revenue estimates were
 
03:17:53.950 --> 03:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
$200,000 more than the governor's so
 
03:17:57.790 --> 03:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
it's 13.9 instead of 13.7
 
03:17:59.630 --> 03:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
million and then the other key
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
difference is if you go down to line 10
 
03:18:04.469 --> 03:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh there's a
 
03:18:07.229 --> 03:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
$397,000 uh warrant a transfer from
 
03:18:10.070 --> 03:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
Surplus that fishing game initiated uh
 
03:18:13.070 --> 03:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
that fiscal approved that occurred uh
 
03:18:14.670 --> 03:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
presumably in the time between the
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
governor putting its budget together
 
03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
until now so we just accounted for that
 
03:18:21.870 --> 03:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
everything else is the same so if you
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
follow a beginning balance of 13.2
 
03:18:26.950 --> 03:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
million which is an unaudited number at
 
03:18:28.990 --> 03:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
the end of fiscal 24 the act for late
 
03:18:32.150 --> 03:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that carrying the
 
03:18:34.790 --> 03:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues as well as what is in
 
03:18:37.269 --> 03:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
the budget for fishing game forward all
 
03:18:39.910 --> 03:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
the way till the end of 27 you see after
 
03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
the Gap adjustment um at the end of the
 
03:18:44.550 --> 03:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
year there's about $1.4 million
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
remaining so the balance goes from about
 
03:18:50.750 --> 03:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:52.830 --> 03:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
million so regarding that transfer that
 
03:18:54.550 --> 03:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
was a transfer from General funds into
 
03:18:56.950 --> 03:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
the fishing no from fishing game Surplus
 
03:18:59.590 --> 03:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
to their to spend oh that's how they
 
03:19:01.469 --> 03:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
operate they have to actually okay yeah
 
03:19:03.910 --> 03:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
so that they are bound fishing game is
 
03:19:06.590 --> 03:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
bound to what is appropriated in the
 
03:19:08.070 --> 03:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
budget in host Bill one every year what
 
03:19:09.950 --> 03:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
they can spend but there is a mechanism
 
03:19:11.670 --> 03:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
for them to come to fiscal to draw from
 
03:19:13.269 --> 03:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
their fishing game Surplus to be able to
 
03:19:15.790 --> 03:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
spend it and that's what that item was
 
03:19:17.910 --> 03:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
so in a budget where spending from their
 
03:19:19.269 --> 03:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
Surplus but does just get transferred
 
03:19:20.189 --> 03:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
into the
 
03:19:23.269 --> 03:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
start uh so you're you're actually
 
03:19:25.750 --> 03:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
appropriating so if you look at line
 
03:19:28.229 --> 03:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
seven that that's their Appropriations
 
03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:34.389 --> 03:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
Surplus from un from from revenue they
 
03:19:36.110 --> 03:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
just their unrestricted re yeah these
 
03:19:38.670 --> 03:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
are just uh unrestricted fishing game
 
03:19:41.030 --> 03:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
fund Appropriations so this is their
 
03:19:44.990 --> 03:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
authorization to spend so line seven uh
 
03:19:46.750 --> 03:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
indicates what they're authorized to
 
03:19:49.950 --> 03:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
spend the revenue is is calcul or is uh
 
03:19:52.630 --> 03:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
captured up top in line three if they
 
03:19:54.429 --> 03:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
want to spend something so let's look at
 
03:19:56.030 --> 03:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
line 7 for instance if you look at
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 the governor's recommended
 
03:20:02.030 --> 03:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
budget is 19.5 million if they need to
 
03:20:03.990 --> 03:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
spend more than that they would have to
 
03:20:05.269 --> 03:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
draw from Surplus from their
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
undesignated Surplus increasing that 195
 
03:20:10.349 --> 03:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
to some other number whatever they ask
 
03:20:12.189 --> 03:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
to spend and so did fiscal Grant the
 
03:20:14.710 --> 03:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
397,000 yes that was approved by fiscal
 
03:20:17.189 --> 03:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you okay
 
03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to to in introduce
 
03:20:21.630 --> 03:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
yourselves as well but also as I'm not
 
03:20:23.790 --> 03:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
sure if Mr L explain to you or not but
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%

03:20:26.790 --> 03:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
great slide deck which is fantastic but
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to actually go through the
 
03:20:32.349 --> 03:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
um the line by line of of your budget so
 
03:20:34.030 --> 03:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
if you could maybe give us a a fairly
 
03:20:35.950 --> 03:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
rapid overview of your slide deck and
 
03:20:37.030 --> 03:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
then we could start going through the
 
03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
actual budget that would be
 
03:20:41.510 --> 03:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
possible and and please introduce
 
03:20:42.950 --> 03:20:42.960 align:start position:0%

time we met the committee had quite a
 
03:21:09.910 --> 03:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
few variety questions for us a few of
 
03:21:11.830 --> 03:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
which we answered uh right away with a
 
03:21:15.030 --> 03:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
few items but uh some of them we uh
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
brought forward in this slide deck today
 
03:21:19.030 --> 03:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
so the presentation today will address
 
03:21:20.630 --> 03:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
some of those questions initially and
 
03:21:24.030 --> 03:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
also some of the other current topics um
 
03:21:25.389 --> 03:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
with that being said and the
 
03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
understanding that we want to get
 
03:21:27.870 --> 03:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
through this so we can go line by line
 
03:21:30.429 --> 03:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
through the budget uh we'll get started
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
we'll start off with the mission
 
03:21:34.550 --> 03:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
statement of the agency our agency is
 
03:21:36.910 --> 03:21:36.920 align:start position:0%

state uh we work with Partners to inform
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
and educate uh New Hampshire residents
 
03:21:54.910 --> 03:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
and visitors about the resources and we
 
03:21:56.750 --> 03:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
provide the public with opportunities to
 
03:21:58.630 --> 03:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
use and appreciate those
 
03:22:00.670 --> 03:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
resources but what does that really all
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
mean I just wanted to share with you a
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
little bit about what we really do we

average over 180 permanent um employees
 
03:22:11.150 --> 03:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
at any one time we have a approximately
 
03:22:13.469 --> 03:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
40 conservation officers in enforcing
 
03:22:16.110 --> 03:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
fish and game laws across the state 38
 
03:22:17.670 --> 03:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
of them are in the field four of them
 
03:22:20.510 --> 03:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
are administrative uh positions we work
 
03:22:22.670 --> 03:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
with an 11 member commission Fishing
 
03:22:24.830 --> 03:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
Game Commission uh we've been in
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%

years um we also manage
 
03:22:33.150 --> 03:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
124 uh Wildlife Management areas to
 
03:22:35.429 --> 03:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
conserve wildlife and their habitat we

own over 60,000 acres of land we have
 
03:22:40.590 --> 03:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
160 buildings that we have to maintain
 
03:22:42.150 --> 03:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
including our headquarters and our four
 
03:22:44.469 --> 03:22:44.479 align:start position:0%

03:22:50.990 --> 03:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
different divisions and um we also do uh
 
03:22:53.830 --> 03:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
boat access sites which we have 130 of
 
03:22:56.429 --> 03:22:56.439 align:start position:0%

03:23:14.349 --> 03:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
those are designated as species of
 
03:23:16.790 --> 03:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
greatest concern in our state our

03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
resources as best as we can um so I I I
 
03:23:50.670 --> 03:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
hope that gives you a little bit better
 
03:23:53.030 --> 03:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
picture of what it means to conserve and
 
03:23:55.910 --> 03:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
inform and provide public
 
03:23:58.269 --> 03:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
opportunities um you did ask us so I'm
 
03:23:59.870 --> 03:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
going to go to the next page which is
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
the agency submission and the governor's
 
03:24:05.830 --> 03:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
budget you did ask us to uh address
 
03:24:08.630 --> 03:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
those points you will see the most uh
 
03:24:10.110 --> 03:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
probably prominent things in the
 
03:24:14.030 --> 03:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
governor's budget that affect us are the
 
03:24:15.990 --> 03:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
most programs and positions did remain
 
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
the same throughout the budget and our
 
03:24:20.469 --> 03:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
our requests however one program the
 
03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
environmental review program is proposed
 
03:24:24.790 --> 03:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
to be moved to dep Department of
 
03:24:27.389 --> 03:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services in the trailer
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
bill um another thing you might see is
 
03:24:33.030 --> 03:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
that U the conservation law enforcement
 
03:24:35.790 --> 03:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
program our general funds that we
 
03:24:38.670 --> 03:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
requested were not allotted or not
 
03:24:41.189 --> 03:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate in that trailer Bill and it
 
03:24:43.550 --> 03:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
affects our conservation law enforcement
 
03:24:45.950 --> 03:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
program uh you'll also see that we're
 
03:24:48.590 --> 03:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
estim ated to utilize lapses in our
 
03:24:51.309 --> 03:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
unrestricted fishing game fund um
 
03:24:53.670 --> 03:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
anticipated by the governor's office to
 
03:24:55.510 --> 03:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
make up the differences and close the
 
03:24:58.309 --> 03:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
gap uh what that will do obviously is
 
03:25:00.670 --> 03:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
give us a close to the bottom line at
 
03:25:02.070 --> 03:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the
 
03:25:05.309 --> 03:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
bium um but it is important to note that
 
03:25:07.269 --> 03:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know throughout this process the
 
03:25:08.910 --> 03:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
agency though I wasn't here when we
 
03:25:12.189 --> 03:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
first built our first uh budget we set
 
03:25:14.150 --> 03:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
forth to meet the governor's office
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
requests of uh the general funds and and
 
03:25:19.550 --> 03:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
reducing those we did that initially and
 
03:25:21.670 --> 03:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
then of course we have uh these
 
03:25:24.510 --> 03:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
additional um changes or alterations
 
03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
that will affect us moving forward I do
 
03:25:30.189 --> 03:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
when I arrived I did see that we had
 
03:25:32.189 --> 03:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
some prioritized needs that may not have
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
been included U I felt like those were
 
03:25:37.429 --> 03:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
the IT issues the retirement issue the
 
03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
environmental review program itself and
 
03:25:43.229 --> 03:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
the employee uh Statewide raises all of
 
03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
which were being addressed in various
 
03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
other um components either in an hb2 or
 
03:25:53.189 --> 03:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
through uh some proposed legislation um
 
03:25:54.710 --> 03:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
of course all of those things are in
 
03:25:56.710 --> 03:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
flux at this point things are changing
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
quickly and daily but uh those are the
 
03:26:01.269 --> 03:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
primary differences I think if you want
 
03:26:03.670 --> 03:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
to compare our our proposed budget to
 
03:26:05.950 --> 03:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed trailer bill that's what we
 
03:26:09.750 --> 03:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
see as significant points to discuss at
 
03:26:11.429 --> 03:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
this point I because we'll be getting
 
03:26:13.349 --> 03:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
into our revenues restricted and
 
03:26:15.189 --> 03:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
unrestricted I'd like to turn it over to
 
03:26:17.710 --> 03:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
Kathy because she's definitely knows
 
03:26:19.189 --> 03:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
more about this stuff than I do and
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
she's been here and she has the history
 
03:26:22.830 --> 03:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
to provide the background if you have
 
03:26:25.150 --> 03:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
questions okay you don't need to provide
 
03:26:26.790 --> 03:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
quite so much detail so we can get
 
03:26:28.030 --> 03:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
through this otherwise we're going to be
 
03:26:29.830 --> 03:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
here longer than we anticipated in order
 
03:26:35.510 --> 03:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:39.710 --> 03:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
okay hi um so there are two different
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
revenues in the fishing game fund there
 
03:26:45.229 --> 03:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
are unrestricted revenues and restricted
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
and restricted are just just that they
 
03:26:50.790 --> 03:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
are for specific programs and purposes
 
03:26:52.790 --> 03:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about what is in the
 
03:26:55.510 --> 03:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds which is restricted
 
03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
revenues and how we can utilize
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
those in statute they are very specific
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
for the income and expenditures of those
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
revenues unrestricted revenues pay for
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
all other components of the department
 
03:27:14.510 --> 03:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
that do not have a restricted component
 
03:27:16.870 --> 03:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted revenues are where we
 
03:27:20.189 --> 03:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
have the problem restricted revenues
 
03:27:20.199 --> 03:27:21.389 align:start position:0%
have the problem restricted revenues
remain

03:27:21.389 --> 03:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
remain
 
03:27:24.349 --> 03:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
healthy so I wanted to go over some
 
03:27:26.189 --> 03:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
discussion points from our meeting on
 
03:27:28.950 --> 03:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
February 3D that we had with you many of
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
you had questions although you just said
 
03:27:34.750 --> 03:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
time is of the essence um so I will not
 
03:27:37.309 --> 03:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
go into the detail of what I have on the
 
03:27:40.670 --> 03:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
slides but you did ask what are our pots
 
03:27:43.070 --> 03:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
of unrestricted revenues and what makes
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
that up we have 13 individual ual
 
03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
categories of revenues that make up the
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
unrestricted fishing game fund and
 
03:27:54.229 --> 03:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's a little description right next
 
03:27:56.670 --> 03:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
to that
 
03:27:59.389 --> 03:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
title that I won't go
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
over unless you have questions after
 
03:28:05.469 --> 03:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
okay what are our dedicated funds we
 
03:28:08.510 --> 03:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
have 16 dedicated accounts within our
 
03:28:10.590 --> 03:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
operating budget the table is on the
 
03:28:13.870 --> 03:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
next slide in addition we also have the
 
03:28:16.150 --> 03:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
lifetime license account which is held
 
03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
at treasury when someone purchases a
 
03:28:21.269 --> 03:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
lifetime license those funds go into the
 
03:28:23.910 --> 03:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
lifetime license account which is held
 
03:28:27.150 --> 03:28:27.160 align:start position:0%
at Treasury and through statute we
 
03:28:31.189 --> 03:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
receive a portion of that it's 9% of the
 
03:28:31.199 --> 03:28:32.389 align:start position:0%
receive a portion of that it's 9% of the
principal

03:28:32.389 --> 03:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
principal
 
03:28:35.189 --> 03:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
balance on an annual
 
03:28:38.070 --> 03:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
basis that account right now has
 
03:28:42.189 --> 03:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
slightly over $3 million in
 
03:28:45.630 --> 03:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
it so the next page is a listing of all
 
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
of our 16 dedicated accounts including
 
03:28:51.349 --> 03:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
the accounting unit the description the
 
03:28:54.510 --> 03:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
RSA the balance forward into the current
 
03:28:57.070 --> 03:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year which is the unobligated
 
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
cash in that account the balance forward
 
03:29:03.110 --> 03:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
for encumbrances the total of which is
 
03:29:05.469 --> 03:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
at the final column of the total balance
 
03:29:10.429 --> 03:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
forward of 9.3 million now even though
 
03:29:13.830 --> 03:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
it looks as though there could be some
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
significant balances in these accounts
 
03:29:20.630 --> 03:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's just what's unobligated on paper
 
03:29:23.670 --> 03:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
the program staff who uh manage these
 
03:29:26.349 --> 03:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
accounts have priority listings of
 
03:29:28.990 --> 03:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
projects and contracts that are all
 
03:29:33.389 --> 03:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
inhouse being reviewed and will be
 
03:29:37.389 --> 03:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
future the other question you asked is
 
03:29:41.830 --> 03:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
where is New Hampshire and compared to
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
other states in license fees so that
 
03:29:47.630 --> 03:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
chart actually um these figures are from
 
03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
2025 and I have highlighted New
 
03:29:53.389 --> 03:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in yellow which indicates the
 
03:29:56.469 --> 03:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
number of the six New England states of
 
03:29:59.469 --> 03:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
where we rank as far as what our license
 
03:29:59.479 --> 03:30:02.630 align:start position:0%
where we rank as far as what our license
fees

03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.030 --> 03:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
are I will keep
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
moving what have the licensed Revenue
 
03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
Trends looked like for the past few
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
years this is a chart for our license
 
03:30:16.269 --> 03:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
revenue from fiscal year 2016 to 24 and
 
03:30:18.630 --> 03:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
as you can see there's a bump in 2020
 
03:30:22.030 --> 03:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
and 2021 that is due to covid when we
 
03:30:24.429 --> 03:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
bumped right up we skewed right up and
 
03:30:27.150 --> 03:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
made a nice little hill we are leveling
 
03:30:30.790 --> 03:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
out at this point in time I do not see a
 
03:30:33.469 --> 03:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
downward Trend at any point in the
 
03:30:38.790 --> 03:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:42.189 --> 03:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
out the next slide is what has been the
 
03:30:44.510 --> 03:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
history of general funds into fishing
 
03:30:44.520 --> 03:30:46.030 align:start position:0%
history of general funds into fishing
game

03:30:46.030 --> 03:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
game
 
03:30:48.830 --> 03:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
um we received our first transfer from
 
03:30:50.910 --> 03:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
the general fund in
 
03:30:54.070 --> 03:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
2014 from 14
 
03:30:58.910 --> 03:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
through 17 they were actual transfers in
 
03:31:02.269 --> 03:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
hb2 directly into the fishing game fund
 
03:31:05.590 --> 03:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
they were not part of our budget from
 
03:31:08.710 --> 03:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 18 through the current
 
03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
03:31:14.309 --> 03:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
25 they are actual revenues within the
 
03:31:16.389 --> 03:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
conservation law enforcement accounting
 
03:31:16.399 --> 03:31:17.950 align:start position:0%
conservation law enforcement accounting
unit

03:31:17.950 --> 03:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
unit
 
03:31:20.590 --> 03:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
7887 and that was a decision that came
 
03:31:23.349 --> 03:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
to between the then director Glenn
 
03:31:25.830 --> 03:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
Norman do and the then Governor Maggie
 
03:31:28.510 --> 03:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
Hassen to make the general funds coming
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
into the fishing game department more
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
transparent and what more transparent do
 
03:31:36.269 --> 03:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
we have than law enforcement you see law
 
03:31:38.349 --> 03:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement all over the place they do
 
03:31:41.910 --> 03:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
so much for residents of the State of
 
03:31:43.990 --> 03:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so does all of the other
 
03:31:46.790 --> 03:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
fishing game staff but law enforcement
 
03:31:48.790 --> 03:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are more noticed out
 
03:31:50.990 --> 03:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
there so it was determined that that is
 
03:31:54.189 --> 03:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
where those funds would be and the way
 
03:31:57.030 --> 03:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
that those funds work is we have always
 
03:31:59.790 --> 03:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
been provided an appropriation of
 
03:32:02.950 --> 03:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue within that accounting unit
 
03:32:07.030 --> 03:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
7887 and the methodology is a transfer
 
03:32:09.630 --> 03:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
is made on a quarterly basis based on
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
actual expenditures incurred so even
 
03:32:14.229 --> 03:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
though there could be a lump sum
 
03:32:17.429 --> 03:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
budgeted for that budget that fiscal
 
03:32:20.429 --> 03:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
year budget we never actually received
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
100% of those revenues because it was
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
based on expenditures only and as you
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
can see by this chart fiscal years 26
 
03:32:31.309 --> 03:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
and 27 have zeroed out because those
 
03:32:33.070 --> 03:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
General funds were taken out in the
 
03:32:35.750 --> 03:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
governor's budget the other question we
 
03:32:38.269 --> 03:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
were asked was illustrate the impact of
 
03:32:41.910 --> 03:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
the pay raises since fiscal year 2022 we
 
03:32:46.110 --> 03:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:49.150 --> 03:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
and benefit classes and it is important
 
03:32:51.910 --> 03:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
to note that we have two divisions the
 
03:32:54.790 --> 03:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
hatcheries and law enforcement that have
 
03:32:58.429 --> 03:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
a very large appropriation for overtime
 
03:33:02.269 --> 03:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
and holiday pay so it's not just class
 
03:33:05.750 --> 03:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
10 full-time permanent positions it also
 
03:33:08.950 --> 03:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
this pay raise affects overtime and
 
03:33:11.070 --> 03:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
holiday pay and of course the associated
 
03:33:13.870 --> 03:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
benefits with
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
that the next slide is 17 years of the
 
03:33:21.870 --> 03:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund the balance from 2008
 
03:33:23.670 --> 03:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
all the way to
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
2024 and as you can see we hit a low in
 
03:33:31.110 --> 03:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2015 of 1 and A5 million in
 
03:33:33.670 --> 03:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
the fishing game fund and it was
 
03:33:37.030 --> 03:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
certainly known prior to that about a
 
03:33:38.870 --> 03:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
year or so prior to that because our
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
first infusion of General funds was
 
03:33:42.590 --> 03:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
2014 that there was a significant
 
03:33:46.750 --> 03:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
problem at the fishing game department
 
03:33:49.110 --> 03:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
and we could no longer just rely on
 
03:33:50.990 --> 03:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
unrestricted fishing game funds to
 
03:33:53.590 --> 03:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
support ourselves with the expenses
 
03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:59.189 --> 03:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
exponentially the use of Fish and Game
 
03:34:02.229 --> 03:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
funds by fiscal year I think is a nice
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
snapshot going all the way back to 2011
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
all the way to our current banial budget
 
03:34:12.030 --> 03:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
submission of
 
03:34:14.630 --> 03:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
2027 in the second column is our
 
03:34:16.670 --> 03:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
unrestricted reeven revenue of course
 
03:34:19.710 --> 03:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
all the way through fiscal year 24 is
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
actual unrestricted Revenue as well as
 
03:34:25.550 --> 03:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
fishing game funded expenses actual
 
03:34:30.670 --> 03:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund expenses 25 26 and 27
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
are budgeted only and those figures are
 
03:34:36.070 --> 03:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget of course in the
 
03:34:38.110 --> 03:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
variance column you can see the
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
significant difference in 25 26 and 27
 
03:34:45.910 --> 03:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
of how that looks we're budgeting 14
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
million in Revenue yet we're expending
 
03:34:56.349 --> 03:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
years without taking into account the
 
03:35:01.510 --> 03:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
lapses that the governor has balanced
 
03:35:05.309 --> 03:35:05.319 align:start position:0%
our budget on using the governor's
 
03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
numbers without any infusion of General
 
03:35:10.590 --> 03:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
funds for 26 or 27 would leave the
 
03:35:12.950 --> 03:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund at a negative $2.5
 
03:35:16.950 --> 03:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
million at the end of the bayum
 
03:35:19.269 --> 03:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
which we know we're going to have lapses
 
03:35:22.150 --> 03:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's not a question we just we have
 
03:35:25.590 --> 03:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
always been told you cannot Budget on
 
03:35:29.110 --> 03:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
lapses so we never have budgeted on
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
lapses it's an exercise on paper when
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
you do that it's not
 
03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
realistic the other um information that
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
was asked for not at our last meeting
 
03:35:44.670 --> 03:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
but UPF front by the LBA was about
 
03:35:48.630 --> 03:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
personnel we have 193 authorized F
 
03:35:51.630 --> 03:35:51.640 align:start position:0%
full-time employees one of them
 
03:35:54.110 --> 03:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
unclassified we have five currently
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
unfunded in this banal budget and they
 
03:36:00.790 --> 03:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
remain unfunded in the 26 and 27 budget
 
03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I have a list of them right there
 
03:36:06.429 --> 03:36:06.439 align:start position:0%
for you our current vacant positions we
 
03:36:10.630 --> 03:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
have 18 of those all are critical to the
 
03:36:13.510 --> 03:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
successful operation of the department
 
03:36:16.670 --> 03:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
two have a start date of this fr Friday
 
03:36:20.910 --> 03:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
one has an active off off offer should
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
be offer not office of employment I'm
 
03:36:26.510 --> 03:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
sorry that's my typo two positions are
 
03:36:28.389 --> 03:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
currently in the interview process
 
03:36:31.189 --> 03:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
including one for my division four
 
03:36:33.510 --> 03:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
division four positions are currently
 
03:36:36.590 --> 03:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
being recruited six overall of these
 
03:36:38.750 --> 03:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
positions are law enforcement and one is
 
03:36:41.630 --> 03:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
a division Chief in the final slide is a
 
03:36:44.590 --> 03:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
list of all of those positions with the
 
03:36:47.830 --> 03:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
position number the division the title
 
03:36:50.189 --> 03:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
and description of that position the
 
03:36:53.229 --> 03:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
accounting unit where it is housed the
 
03:36:55.790 --> 03:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
type of funding Federal other or fishing
 
03:36:59.750 --> 03:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
game funds and the date since it's been
 
03:37:03.790 --> 03:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
vacant so that and a nutshell is our
 
03:37:06.189 --> 03:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
slideshow which thank you for the Kudos
 
03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
that is good thank you very much it's
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
excellent welcome a question regarding
 
03:37:13.590 --> 03:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
unrestricted funds so
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
what license fees
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
make up are unrestricted basically what
 
03:37:20.870 --> 03:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
license fees well what what goes into
 
03:37:22.389 --> 03:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted
 
03:37:26.189 --> 03:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
funds well with the 13 parts of funds
 
03:37:29.030 --> 03:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
most of of them appear to be
 
03:37:34.750 --> 03:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
restricted no no it um on slide
 
03:37:39.269 --> 03:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
number one two three four slide number
 
03:37:42.510 --> 03:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
four what are our pots of unrestricted
 
03:37:46.110 --> 03:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
revenues those okay so those
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
licensees go ahead I'm sorry uh license
 
03:37:54.030 --> 03:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
is only about 35% of our total
 
03:37:56.710 --> 03:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
unrestricted they make up only about 35%
 
03:37:58.990 --> 03:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
of that total money okay and what's the
 
03:37:59.000 --> 03:37:59.910 align:start position:0%
of that total money okay and what's the
other

03:37:59.910 --> 03:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
65% but it varies across all of these
 
03:38:06.750 --> 03:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
these pots all of these pots like 9% is
 
03:38:11.189 --> 03:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
for miscellaneous income um I think uh
 
03:38:14.309 --> 03:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
ohrv and Marine unfunded Road Road Road
 
03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
tolls are about 7 % it's about a million
 
03:38:20.830 --> 03:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
and a half dollars per year between
 
03:38:20.840 --> 03:38:21.830 align:start position:0%
and a half dollars per year between
those

03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:38:24.910 --> 03:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
two the Federal grant recoveries which
 
03:38:28.630 --> 03:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
is the indirect charge on federal
 
03:38:32.110 --> 03:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
grants that is 900 to a million dollar
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
per year that goes into the unrestricted
 
03:38:37.309 --> 03:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund I think I asked the
 
03:38:39.870 --> 03:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
question backwards so for instance
 
03:38:42.630 --> 03:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
fishing licenses where does that come
 
03:38:45.670 --> 03:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
in hunting licenses what pot is it in
 
03:38:48.030 --> 03:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
are they unrestricted restricted well
 
03:38:49.510 --> 03:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
they are they are
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
unrestricted with the exception of when
 
03:38:53.750 --> 03:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
you buy as an example when you purchase
 
03:38:56.309 --> 03:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
a resident no when you purchase a
 
03:38:58.510 --> 03:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
resident fishing license for the year
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
your fishing license is
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
$44 in addition to that you pay a $1
 
03:39:07.469 --> 03:39:07.479 align:start position:0%
Fisheries habitat fee that Fisheries
 
03:39:10.590 --> 03:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
habitat fee is restricted it goes into
 
03:39:13.150 --> 03:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
the Fisheries habitat account
 
03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
$44 stays in the unrestricted Ed part of
 
03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
Licensing and as a general if it can be
 
03:39:22.349 --> 03:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
generalized if not be specific when was
 
03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
the last time license Fe the the
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
unrestricted component of license fees
 
03:39:32.670 --> 03:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
was increased 2018 2018 we had a
 
03:39:36.750 --> 03:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
increase of $10 per type that was not
 
03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
across the board license fee
 
03:39:42.590 --> 03:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
increase it was $10 I believe on a
 
03:39:47.309 --> 03:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
hunting and $10 on a fishing as well as

we've gotten all right why don't we move
 
03:40:01.830 --> 03:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:05.469 --> 03:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
budget and you can which I guess starts
 
03:40:07.349 --> 03:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
on page so now we're on just for the
 
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
people that are watching at home uh this

Mr chair it actually starts at the end
 
03:40:18.479 --> 03:40:19.389 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it actually starts at the end
of

03:40:19.389 --> 03:40:19.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
7:33 the fishing game oh you're right my
 
03:40:23.550 --> 03:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
bad it I've got a big X on the top of
 
03:40:25.070 --> 03:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
that page but yes it does start at the
 
03:40:28.309 --> 03:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
very very bottom of page 733 thank
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
you so you just want to go forward from
 
03:40:31.680 --> 03:40:33.550 align:start position:0%
you so you just want to go forward from
there

03:40:33.550 --> 03:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:40:36.910 --> 03:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
and whatever you would like for me to do
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
I've never done it in this manner
 
03:40:41.429 --> 03:40:41.439 align:start position:0%
usually it's a question answer type
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
thing but I get it um but if you could
 
03:40:44.640 --> 03:40:46.469 align:start position:0%
thing but I get it um but if you could
uh

03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
walk us through it certainly yeah
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
certainly do you want me to go through
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
each accounting unit or yeah okay okay
 
03:40:56.510 --> 03:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
so the first accounting unit is called
 
03:40:59.229 --> 03:40:59.239 align:start position:0%
non-game support and this is actually a
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
general funded accounting unit of
 
03:41:05.790 --> 03:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and this is the match that goes
 
03:41:09.870 --> 03:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
into the noname dedicated account per
 
03:41:09.880 --> 03:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
into the noname dedicated account per
RSA

03:41:11.510 --> 03:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
03:41:15.550 --> 03:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
22 colon 6 I believe it is so this is
 
03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
basically in law that has in law that it
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
has to come out of General funds correct
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
for this yes correct and it is part of
 
03:41:24.349 --> 03:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
our operating budget I actually have to
 
03:41:27.030 --> 03:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
do a payment voucher for this and then
 
03:41:29.830 --> 03:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
work with treasury to receive that
 
03:41:32.510 --> 03:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
$100,000 back into our account is it for
 
03:41:34.149 --> 03:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
General is it for your general use or is
 
03:41:36.110 --> 03:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
it for a specific use on your side it is
 
03:41:39.229 --> 03:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
specifically for noname right n noname
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:46.710 --> 03:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
RSA great just a quick example of what's
 
03:41:50.750 --> 03:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
non-game the non-game program it it
 
03:41:52.269 --> 03:41:52.279 align:start position:0%
varies it could be carer blue
 
03:41:54.990 --> 03:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
butterflies it could be um you know
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
salamanders a variety of species that
 
03:42:01.910 --> 03:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
are not hunted species um typically it's
 
03:42:05.110 --> 03:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh species that aren't hunted and then
 
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
it also includes our threatened and
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
endangered species as well but not all
 
03:42:11.630 --> 03:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
Mame species are threatened and
 
03:42:15.630 --> 03:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
endangered contrib send newsl
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
yes the non-game program relies heavily
 
03:42:23.279 --> 03:42:24.229 align:start position:0%
yes the non-game program relies heavily
upon

03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
upon
 
03:42:27.429 --> 03:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
donations and we have to prove that we
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
have raised that amount in donations in
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
order to be able to apply for that
 
03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
funds should I go on okay so the next
 
03:42:46.830 --> 03:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
several accounting units are all within
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
the office of the director we have 7888
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
which is the expenses for our Fishing
 
03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
Game Commission the 11 members we
 
03:42:59.670 --> 03:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
reimburse them mileage and we pay for
 
03:43:02.630 --> 03:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
their lunch for their monthly commission
 
03:43:05.870 --> 03:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
meetings the next accounting unit is
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
1171 office of director this is where
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
the director and her staff up there in
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
the director's site moment represent
 
03:43:16.269 --> 03:43:16.279 align:start position:0%
papovich sorry
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
if I may I know that the uh amounts are
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
really small but for the
 
03:43:23.750 --> 03:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
commission there seems to be quite a big
 
03:43:28.349 --> 03:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
drop for 25 and a back to even higher in
 
03:43:32.590 --> 03:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
26 27 I know it's not a huge amount but
 
03:43:35.670 --> 03:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
how come we saved so much money in 25 so
 
03:43:38.510 --> 03:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 24 I actually had to go
 
03:43:40.590 --> 03:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
to fiscal committee to increase their
 
03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
mileage budget they are entitled per our
 
03:43:48.550 --> 03:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
SAA to receive mileage reimbursement for
 
03:43:51.910 --> 03:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
the mileage that is incurred for them to
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
travel to fishing game business okay so
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
I had to go to fiscal committee and
 
03:44:01.469 --> 03:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
increase that budget for 24 so 25's
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
budget of only
 
03:44:05.550 --> 03:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
$112,000 is actually the budget that
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
passed and we are almost there for
 
03:44:11.510 --> 03:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
spending so the director will make the
 
03:44:13.189 --> 03:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
decision whether we go back to fiscal
 
03:44:15.710 --> 03:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
and request more additional funds or if
 
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
we do something else so we upped it to
 
03:44:21.910 --> 03:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
20,000 for instate travel reimbursement
 
03:44:24.229 --> 03:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
for the upcoming banial budget so that
 
03:44:26.070 --> 03:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
we did not fall
 
03:44:29.070 --> 03:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
short you're
 
03:44:31.830 --> 03:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
welcome so the next accounting unit is
 
03:44:33.790 --> 03:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
Office of the director where we have our
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%

03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
under the um director this is
 
03:44:39.520 --> 03:44:41.189 align:start position:0%
under the um director this is
HR

03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
HR
 
03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
the Federal grant coordinator
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and Rule schools her
 
03:44:49.269 --> 03:44:49.279 align:start position:0%

03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
Associated expenditures with the office
 
03:44:57.309 --> 03:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:44:59.950 --> 03:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
director the next one down is our gifts
 
03:45:02.830 --> 03:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
and donations account and at the last
 
03:45:04.830 --> 03:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
meeting there was a couple of questions
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
about gifts and donations and how we
 
03:45:06.720 --> 03:45:08.309 align:start position:0%
about gifts and donations and how we
received

03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
received
 
03:45:12.550 --> 03:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
them we all set there one more question
 
03:45:15.149 --> 03:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
that is one of our dedicated accounts I
 
03:45:16.750 --> 03:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
know I just I just kind of missed the
 
03:45:19.590 --> 03:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
window on the uh Office of the director
 
03:45:21.429 --> 03:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
right we have an increase of about
 
03:45:24.389 --> 03:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
100,000 if I recall correctly we were
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
talking was that an additional employee
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
that got reassigned there or is this an
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
increase in the expenditures on the same
 
03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
number of employees we have the same
 
03:45:36.269 --> 03:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
number of employees so it's increasing
 
03:45:38.030 --> 03:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures on the same number of
 
03:45:39.550 --> 03:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
employees yeah because it looks like an
 
03:45:42.590 --> 03:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
almost 10% increase in the
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
cost that sounds like a lot of an
 
03:45:48.910 --> 03:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
increase for a year over year so what
 
03:45:50.910 --> 03:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
you see in fiscal year
 
03:45:54.030 --> 03:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
24 is critical because it's actual
 
03:45:56.590 --> 03:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures so we are dealing with a
 
03:45:59.710 --> 03:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
whole we may have okay so I think uh
 
03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
We've covered part of that uh the last
 
03:46:04.429 --> 03:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
time but if you can really quickly go
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:10.149 --> 03:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
again fiscal year 24 is actual
 
03:46:14.309 --> 03:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
expenditures based on actual um cost
 
03:46:18.630 --> 03:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year year 25 is budgeted so quite
 
03:46:20.830 --> 03:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
often when you submit a budget and you
 
03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
have people in their pots of where where
 
03:46:26.110 --> 03:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
they are right like we have people in
 
03:46:28.269 --> 03:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
the office of director when you have
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
internal movement a person can move from
 
03:46:33.389 --> 03:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
one position to another that isn't
 
03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
reflected in a budget if you're in the
 
03:46:38.550 --> 03:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
middle of a bium so that person could be
 
03:46:41.830 --> 03:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
earning additional money we have to do
 
03:46:44.429 --> 03:46:44.439 align:start position:0%
salary and benefit adjustments at the
 
03:46:47.670 --> 03:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
end of the year to increase cost to be a
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.950 --> 03:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
deficit did I totally confuse you now no
 
03:46:55.590 --> 03:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
but you reminded me of what we talked
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
last time so I'm good for now thank you
 
03:47:01.149 --> 03:47:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
you and are we good with gifts and
 
03:47:07.950 --> 03:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
donations okay president
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
Murray looks like there was a
 
03:47:13.269 --> 03:47:13.279 align:start position:0%
significant gift in um or acquisition in
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
2024 um and it's zero it out are there

03:47:23.349 --> 03:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions you can just say
 
03:47:26.149 --> 03:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
no not that would go in the gifts and
 
03:47:29.189 --> 03:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
donations account that was a rather
 
03:47:32.670 --> 03:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
unusual right opportunity that someone
 
03:47:35.070 --> 03:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
who bordered uh property that we were
 
03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
acquired acquiring wanted to make a
 
03:47:40.349 --> 03:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
donation to the department as match for
 
03:47:42.070 --> 03:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
those federal funds so that we could
 
03:47:44.830 --> 03:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
purchase that land so the best place to
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
to put that in transparency was the
 
03:47:50.309 --> 03:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
gifts and donations account it's
 
03:47:52.429 --> 03:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
definitely a unique approach to trying
 
03:47:54.389 --> 03:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
to you know acquire a land in a
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
different Manner and it was a way to
 
03:47:59.630 --> 03:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
work this legally it's not something we
 
03:48:01.469 --> 03:48:01.479 align:start position:0%
commonly do I'm not saying we wouldn't
 
03:48:04.149 --> 03:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
do it again if if the opportunity arose
 
03:48:11.950 --> 03:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
it landowner relations program
 
03:48:17.149 --> 03:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this is one of the Class
 
03:48:19.950 --> 03:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
10 permanent full-time positions that is
 
03:48:22.950 --> 03:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
unfunded and remains
 
03:48:25.750 --> 03:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded so right now we just have some
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
current expense and um some landowner
 
03:48:30.630 --> 03:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
relations initiative cost in there which
 
03:48:37.110 --> 03:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:37.120 --> 03:48:38.910 align:start position:0%
 
cost

03:48:38.910 --> 03:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
2162 is our transfers to oit as you can
 
03:48:46.030 --> 03:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
see that is a very large amount
 
03:48:49.189 --> 03:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
um 1.2 million and 1.3 million
 
03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:59.149 --> 03:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
27 our represent wer so last time we met
 
03:49:00.670 --> 03:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
in the previous
 
03:49:03.710 --> 03:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
budget we were told there was a problem
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
in out ofate
 
03:49:09.710 --> 03:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
ohrv because we were harder to get
 
03:49:11.309 --> 03:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
permission than the other states and
 
03:49:13.750 --> 03:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
they were working on a computer system
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
so they could go online line has that
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
been finished finally well that has
 
03:49:21.110 --> 03:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing to do with transfers
 
03:49:25.149 --> 03:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
to doit doit is not involved in that at
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
all they're not creating that system no
 
03:49:30.349 --> 03:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
they are not doit does not do anything
 
03:49:34.429 --> 03:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
like that for agencies so we have um
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
contracted with our online vendor that
 
03:49:39.550 --> 03:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
currently sells our online
 
03:49:43.030 --> 03:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
licenses and in law that has to be up
 
03:49:45.630 --> 03:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
and ready and running by September of
 
03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
this year and we are on track to do
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
that okay so what what's the other oit
 
03:49:54.189 --> 03:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
money going out
 
03:49:58.389 --> 03:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
for it's uh it's all of our uh network
 
03:50:01.110 --> 03:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
connections it's computers for our staff
 
03:50:03.510 --> 03:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's maintaining the software that we
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
have updates to uh our technology
 
03:50:08.750 --> 03:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
systems and to be honest with you we
 
03:50:12.269 --> 03:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
could use more I'll just up all of the
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
LIC that we have to buy it's all the
 
03:50:18.070 --> 03:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
software licenses we have to pay for
 
03:50:21.389 --> 03:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
and we receive an invoice from doit on a
 
03:50:23.790 --> 03:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
monthly basis and we pay that invoice
 
03:50:26.750 --> 03:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
based on their cost some of those costs
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
are direct cost for direct Personnel
 
03:50:31.349 --> 03:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
that are embedded at fishing game as
 
03:50:33.990 --> 03:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
well as direct cost of purchasing
 
03:50:37.189 --> 03:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
computers and licenses for us and then a
 
03:50:39.950 --> 03:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
good part of that invoice is for what is
 
03:50:42.750 --> 03:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
called shared cost which all other state
 
03:50:46.149 --> 03:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
agencies share in that cost
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a variety of things software
 
03:50:55.149 --> 03:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:59.389 --> 03:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
that papovich thank you um since you are
 
03:51:01.630 --> 03:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
getting detailed invoices was there any
 
03:51:03.510 --> 03:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
point in time where you guys look to see
 
03:51:05.630 --> 03:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
if some of those Services if you are
 
03:51:08.590 --> 03:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to look at other entities who
 
03:51:10.510 --> 03:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
may provide them you may find better
 
03:51:13.110 --> 03:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
deals than you have from we're not
 
03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that okay so not even as a
 
03:51:18.469 --> 03:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
hypothetical to help you decide nope
 
03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
you all right that's doit 2114 is
 
03:51:35.349 --> 03:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
actually Wildlife Legacy initiative this
 
03:51:38.349 --> 03:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
is one of the 16 dedicated accounts and
 
03:51:43.149 --> 03:51:43.159 align:start position:0%
this is a $10 donation that someone can
 
03:51:47.030 --> 03:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
make at any time online or um in in our
 
03:51:50.349 --> 03:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
front office and that $10 goes into this
 
03:51:53.149 --> 03:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
account called The Wildlife Legacy
 
03:51:57.030 --> 03:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
initiative and those funds are used to
 
03:52:01.710 --> 03:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
pay for two accounting units up 2128 the
 
03:52:04.469 --> 03:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
landowner relations program now in
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
statute the executive director can
 
03:52:10.349 --> 03:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
determine where those funds can be
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
used and I believe the statute indicates
 
03:52:18.110 --> 03:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
for an annual basis if I'm not mistaken
 
03:52:19.990 --> 03:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
those funds have always as long as I've
 
03:52:21.870 --> 03:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
been at fishing game been earmarked
 
03:52:24.389 --> 03:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
towards the landowner relations program
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
so that accounting unit 2128 does not
 
03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
cost the fishing game fund anything it
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
is um totally self-supporting by this
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Legacy initiative as you can
 
03:52:37.750 --> 03:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
see there's only a class 29 that's used
 
03:52:41.910 --> 03:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
as a transfer to pay 2128 accounting
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:51.189 --> 03:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
incurred and then the final accounting
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
unit within the office of the director
 
03:52:56.469 --> 03:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
8049 the wildlife Heritage
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
Foundation they are our nonprofit
 
03:53:05.110 --> 03:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
partner that receives donations and they
 
03:53:07.269 --> 03:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
um raise money on behalf of the
 
03:53:10.710 --> 03:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
department and program staff or
 
03:53:15.990 --> 03:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
Department staff can put in a Grant
 
03:53:18.189 --> 03:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
application for
 
03:53:22.269 --> 03:53:22.279 align:start position:0%
certain projects for certain um we have
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
had everything from Nets Predator Nets
 
03:53:28.389 --> 03:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
at our hatcheries to a trailer for the
 
03:53:31.389 --> 03:53:31.399 align:start position:0%
Wildlife division or it just it goes
 
03:53:34.910 --> 03:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
across the board two ongoing projects
 
03:53:37.110 --> 03:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
under the wildlife Heritage Foundation
 
03:53:40.670 --> 03:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
are our canines are police
 
03:53:43.630 --> 03:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
dogs as well as the berry Conservation
 
03:53:43.640 --> 03:53:48.389 align:start position:0%
dogs as well as the berry Conservation
Camp

03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.750 --> 03:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
so that wraps up the first activity of
 
03:53:58.590 --> 03:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:01.070 --> 03:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
director and seeing no questions I'll
 
03:54:03.790 --> 03:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
move on am I
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
okay um then we get into administrative
 
03:54:08.990 --> 03:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
support which is my division the
 
03:54:11.349 --> 03:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
business division the first accounting
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
unit actually is the public
 
03:54:17.309 --> 03:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
specialty account and that is the
 
03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
account that we use to purchase
 
03:54:21.429 --> 03:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
merchandise and the revenues from the
 
03:54:23.349 --> 03:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
sale of that merchandise go right back
 
03:54:27.469 --> 03:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:30.349 --> 03:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
account and then we
 
03:54:33.750 --> 03:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
have accounting unit 2110 business
 
03:54:37.550 --> 03:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
management which is me and several of my
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
staff we have some big ticket items in
 
03:54:42.149 --> 03:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit I'd like to bring
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
your attention to the first first one of
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
which is indirect cost for
 
03:54:52.030 --> 03:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
das H for about
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
$275,000 each year that is for overhead
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
cost in the Statewide cost allocation
 
03:55:00.990 --> 03:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
plan to the Department of administrative
 
03:55:03.149 --> 03:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
services for the work that they do on
 
03:55:06.630 --> 03:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
behalf of non-general funded state
 
03:55:09.950 --> 03:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
agencies we then have Debt Service which
 
03:55:12.149 --> 03:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
is a line item within this accounting
 
03:55:16.349 --> 03:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
unit to pay for past capital budget
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and treasury
 
03:55:21.630 --> 03:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
automatically sweeps that class line for
 
03:55:21.640 --> 03:55:23.670 align:start position:0%
automatically sweeps that class line for
debt

03:55:23.670 --> 03:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
debt
 
03:55:26.149 --> 03:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
repayments then the next really big one
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
that you might notice is
 
03:55:31.110 --> 03:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits health insurance for
 
03:55:31.120 --> 03:55:32.309 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits health insurance for
our

03:55:32.309 --> 03:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:55:34.670 --> 03:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
retirees about a million dollars each
 
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
year very significant fish and game is a
 
03:55:40.149 --> 03:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency is responsible for
 
03:55:43.870 --> 03:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
paying the retirees health benefit cost
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
to are people who have retired represent
 
03:55:49.590 --> 03:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you um I appreciate you
 
03:55:52.710 --> 03:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
highlighting the line um it seems to
 
03:55:57.070 --> 03:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
have grown from 775 to 1125 I
 
03:56:02.229 --> 03:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
mean from 24 to 27 that is a steep steep
 
03:56:05.550 --> 03:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
hill could you help us understand why is
 
03:56:08.870 --> 03:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
it such a steep growth because this is
 
03:56:08.880 --> 03:56:09.790 align:start position:0%
it such a steep growth because this is
not

03:56:09.790 --> 03:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:56:13.389 --> 03:56:13.399 align:start position:0%
inflation I wish I could but I have no
 
03:56:16.830 --> 03:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
control over over this dollar number um
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
we are provided figures by the
 
03:56:21.429 --> 03:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
03:56:23.710 --> 03:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
risk risk and
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
benefits section
 
03:56:31.309 --> 03:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
that they estimate I assume based on the
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
current retirees that we have in the
 
03:56:37.469 --> 03:56:37.479 align:start position:0%
cost of health insurance as it may be in
 
03:56:38.830 --> 03:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
these future
 
03:56:41.950 --> 03:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
years so those three numbers that I
 
03:56:44.830 --> 03:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
provided to you the S cap
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
The Debt Service and the um
 
03:56:51.790 --> 03:56:51.800 align:start position:0%
retirees uh health insurance those
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
figures are provided to us by other
 
03:56:56.550 --> 03:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
state agencies we have no control over
 
03:56:59.790 --> 03:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
what we plug in it's the same with
 
03:57:03.830 --> 03:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
doit the doit I wish uh yeah it's it's a
 
03:57:05.990 --> 03:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
different discussion agreed but look I
 
03:57:07.469 --> 03:57:07.479 align:start position:0%
mean at the end of the day we have
 
03:57:09.469 --> 03:57:09.479 align:start position:0%
control over what goes into Deb service
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
because you got to ask for those things
 
03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
to be capitalized and then you know what
 
03:57:15.429 --> 03:57:15.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay so you don't control
 
03:57:17.830 --> 03:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
what this year but we want to make sure
 
03:57:19.750 --> 03:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
that yes we have control up front but we
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we have enough to
 
03:57:24.030 --> 03:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
cover that debt service again with the
 
03:57:26.149 --> 03:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
indirect cost that you were bringing in
 
03:57:29.269 --> 03:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
bringing up you know that's the DS and
 
03:57:31.950 --> 03:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
whatnot um I understand that you have
 
03:57:34.990 --> 03:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
less control over that I know that you
 
03:57:37.790 --> 03:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
may not be able to change the amounts
 
03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
that you owe for the benefits MH but I
 
03:57:43.590 --> 03:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
would appreciate a bit more background
 
03:57:46.870 --> 03:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
into again at least a breakdown
 
03:57:49.389 --> 03:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
of why they're expect it to grow so
 
03:57:51.189 --> 03:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
steeply is it a higher number of
 
03:57:54.510 --> 03:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
retirees is it way more on health
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
insurance are the uh pension benefits
 
03:57:59.870 --> 03:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
contributions that are required are
 
03:58:03.309 --> 03:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
higher so I I hear you when you tell me
 
03:58:05.710 --> 03:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
that you don't control what you owe on
 
03:58:09.030 --> 03:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
this but understanding why you owe more
 
03:58:12.349 --> 03:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
I think we would benefit from
 
03:58:14.469 --> 03:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
understanding right whether again it's
 
03:58:17.110 --> 03:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
higher number of retirees higher
 
03:58:19.110 --> 03:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
pensions you know higher pension
 
03:58:21.189 --> 03:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
contributions and we can get into a
 
03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
whole sidebar on our uh you know funding
 
03:58:27.429 --> 03:58:27.439 align:start position:0%
for the state pension plans and all that
 
03:58:30.510 --> 03:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
that I I try to avoid desperately here
 
03:58:32.910 --> 03:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time so just just in
 
03:58:34.750 --> 03:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
terms of understanding what drives this
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
increases right even though you have to
 
03:58:39.950 --> 03:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
maybe go ask the you know retirement
 
03:58:41.870 --> 03:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
system or whatnot why in God's name are
 
03:58:44.189 --> 03:58:44.199 align:start position:0%
you giving me this uh very highest
 
03:58:49.269 --> 03:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
esates so I would have to ask and I I in
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
asking in the past it is a combination
 
03:58:57.070 --> 03:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
of the age group at your agency and the
 
03:59:00.389 --> 03:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
anticipated retirements we have a lot of
 
03:59:03.070 --> 03:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
gray hairs at our agency oh no trust me
 
03:59:05.070 --> 03:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
I've got I've done actual study actual
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
studies around that before and I
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
understand the mechanics of it but some
 
03:59:11.429 --> 03:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
details on what drives this because look
 
03:59:13.309 --> 03:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
what we need to understand is with an
 
03:59:15.590 --> 03:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
Actuarial you'd get more than two two
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
years projection right so they'd be able
 
03:59:20.309 --> 03:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
to tell us whether this will snowball
 
03:59:22.630 --> 03:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
really hard or this is just a temporary
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
Spike or what is the trajectory that we
 
03:59:26.830 --> 03:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
expect because again when we budget we
 
03:59:28.510 --> 03:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
don't just look at the next budget cycle
 
03:59:29.950 --> 03:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm trying to get to
 
03:59:31.950 --> 03:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
that even if we don't necessarily
 
03:59:33.910 --> 03:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
control it we should be at least able to
 
03:59:36.110 --> 03:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
see it a bit further down the road and
 
03:59:37.389 --> 03:59:37.399 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on and what the
 
03:59:39.469 --> 03:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
drivers are behind it we may not be able
 
03:59:41.389 --> 03:59:41.399 align:start position:0%
to change what drives it but at least
 
03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
get what's going on okay that's what I
 
03:59:45.630 --> 03:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
would % agree with you sir thank you
 
03:59:46.830 --> 03:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
very much for asking that question
 
03:59:48.030 --> 03:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
because to be honest with you as I
 
03:59:50.349 --> 03:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
walked in this door and I'm hearing 20
 
03:59:53.389 --> 03:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
year 25 year 32 year and I'm seeing I'm
 
03:59:55.630 --> 03:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
I'm realizing wow half of the staff is
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
going to be gone before I even get my
 
03:59:59.630 --> 03:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
feet under me and it was actually one of
 
04:00:01.389 --> 04:00:01.399 align:start position:0%
the questions I had immediately is like
 
04:00:03.030 --> 04:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
I need to get an assessment of what we
 
04:00:05.550 --> 04:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
look like going forward honestly I
 
04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
haven't had the time to do it yet but it
 
04:00:09.790 --> 04:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
is on my list as far as figuring out
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
what we need going forward thank
 
04:00:15.630 --> 04:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
you when she first came on board I told
 
04:00:19.590 --> 04:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
her my retirement date was March 1st of
 
04:00:22.750 --> 04:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
26 so a year from now but wait to be
 
04:00:25.070 --> 04:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
specific yeah I I'm trying to convince
 
04:00:27.429 --> 04:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
them differently I I I have pushed that
 
04:00:29.429 --> 04:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
out a little bit so but I'm one of those
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
gray hairs
 
04:00:34.750 --> 04:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
so all right moving down
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
um unless there are further questions
 
04:00:40.149 --> 04:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
for accounting unit
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
2110 all set accounting unit 2111
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh ohrv registration this is where the
 
04:00:50.870 --> 04:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
cost for the registration program is
 
04:00:53.550 --> 04:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
within the business division we have
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
increased that significantly for the
 
04:00:55.920 --> 04:00:56.910 align:start position:0%
increased that significantly for the
next

04:00:56.910 --> 04:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
next
 
04:01:00.469 --> 04:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
bium this account is funded fully by
 
04:01:04.030 --> 04:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
ohrv revenues the online program that's
 
04:01:08.349 --> 04:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
due to be um taking place this fall in
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
September is going to cost the
 
04:01:11.950 --> 04:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
department a significant amount of money
 
04:01:15.149 --> 04:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
much it's much more costly to run an
 
04:01:18.149 --> 04:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
online program in this manner than it
 
04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
will be
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
to leave it the way it is so hold on
 
04:01:26.110 --> 04:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
just there so this is the the online
 
04:01:28.389 --> 04:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
registration for snowmobiles and all is
 
04:01:32.349 --> 04:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
now running well no it'll be in effect
 
04:01:36.070 --> 04:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
September so that's why this budget has
 
04:01:43.950 --> 04:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
and where is the increase the increas is
 
04:01:50.349 --> 04:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
expenses thank you well that is
 
04:01:56.269 --> 04:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
awesome you
 
04:01:58.710 --> 04:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
like no I like the fact that it's going
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
to be online starting in September 1st
 
04:02:03.670 --> 04:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
you said right in September where it's
 
04:02:05.149 --> 04:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
in September do want to commit to
 
04:02:07.389 --> 04:02:07.399 align:start position:0%
September 1st okay okay that's fair
 
04:02:07.399 --> 04:02:08.189 align:start position:0%
September 1st okay okay that's fair
thank

04:02:08.189 --> 04:02:08.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:02:11.070 --> 04:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
you anticipate a bigger
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
increase income as well right no we do
 
04:02:16.510 --> 04:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
not we're going to lose income by
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
running this
 
04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
program because it's going to cost the
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
department we have to for the ohrv
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
program we have to transfer 70 to 72% of
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
registration funds to dncr we keep the
 
04:02:35.950 --> 04:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
remainder with that remainder we have to
 
04:02:38.990 --> 04:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
run this ohrv registration program
 
04:02:41.349 --> 04:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
within the business division we have to
 
04:02:44.429 --> 04:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
run ohrv education and LA law
 
04:02:48.189 --> 04:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement as well as ohrv enforcement
 
04:02:50.710 --> 04:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement and we're going to
 
04:02:54.790 --> 04:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
be retaining less funds because of
 
04:02:57.070 --> 04:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
running the program not retaining from
 
04:02:59.630 --> 04:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
the sale but running the program will
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:05.349 --> 04:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
funds the
 
04:03:07.309 --> 04:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
legislature why does it cost more to run
 
04:03:09.630 --> 04:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
the program because it costs more to run
 
04:03:12.790 --> 04:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
an online program than it does to run a
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:18.680 --> 04:03:22.670 align:start position:0%
 
program

04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.790 --> 04:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
um well it wasn't our sell selling point
 
04:03:29.309 --> 04:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
sir it was probably other PE no it was
 
04:03:32.630 --> 04:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
not our selling point well so I will if
 
04:03:34.950 --> 04:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
I may I I think that uh what we're going
 
04:03:37.149 --> 04:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
to see is a transfer of people who
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
usually buy in person are going to then
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
buy online and from my understanding in
 
04:03:45.670 --> 04:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
talking with everyone about this program
 
04:03:48.389 --> 04:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
we're not anticipating a huge increase
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
in new
 
04:03:53.670 --> 04:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
snowmobile purchasers but rather a
 
04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
transition of the way that people are
 
04:03:58.510 --> 04:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
acquiring their
 
04:04:00.590 --> 04:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
license yeah so here's what we were told
 
04:04:03.990 --> 04:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
in fiscal just so we're clear people are
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
not out of state people are not coming
 
04:04:09.229 --> 04:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire because they can't go
 
04:04:11.710 --> 04:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
online and get their registration
 
04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
they're instead going to Vermont and
 
04:04:15.309 --> 04:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
Maine and now we're hearing that that's
 
04:04:17.070 --> 04:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
not what we're going to expect sir I
 
04:04:19.590 --> 04:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
would tell you again that argument did
 
04:04:21.790 --> 04:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
not come from our department most
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
certainly did it came from your right at
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
the very top that's who comes to fiscal
 
04:04:27.630 --> 04:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
so so at this point neither of us were
 
04:04:30.349 --> 04:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
there I I hope that is I hope that is
 
04:04:32.469 --> 04:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
correct I hope that what you were told
 
04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
two years ago is correct because that
 
04:04:37.870 --> 04:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
would be very optimistic for us um you
 
04:04:40.389 --> 04:04:40.399 align:start position:0%
know all all I can say is We Know It The
 
04:04:42.469 --> 04:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
Upfront cost is going to be costly for
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
us and managing it My Hope Is that we
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
can promote it we're going to work with
 
04:04:50.110 --> 04:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh the tourism Bureau to help promote
 
04:04:52.990 --> 04:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
this idea and hope that we can increase
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
the user groups so so a couple points
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
there you said The Upfront costs I
 
04:04:59.429 --> 04:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
completely understand that are you
 
04:05:01.070 --> 04:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that's why we're taking
 
04:05:03.469 --> 04:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
a hit this year but the ongoing C the
 
04:05:05.309 --> 04:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
operating costs will not be significant
 
04:05:07.110 --> 04:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting the ongoing cost will
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
be significant as we may or may not
 
04:05:11.790 --> 04:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
we're not sure yet we may or may not
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
have to hire a person for customer
 
04:05:17.309 --> 04:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
service because people who purchase
 
04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
things online typically have a lot of
 
04:05:23.229 --> 04:05:23.239 align:start position:0%
trouble doing so we answer a lot of
 
04:05:25.349 --> 04:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
customer service calls now with our
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
licensing program online the phones are
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
ringing constantly so once this program
 
04:05:34.229 --> 04:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
is online we are
 
04:05:37.030 --> 04:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
anticipating many many many calls all
 
04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
day so which of your licensing programs
 
04:05:40.910 --> 04:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
is already online that you're having
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
these problems to purchase a hunting or
 
04:05:45.149 --> 04:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
fishing license
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
and you have more people to support that
 
04:05:50.070 --> 04:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
program than to support not having that
 
04:05:52.189 --> 04:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
program in other words to take the phone
 
04:05:54.189 --> 04:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
to answer the phone to get the license
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
which I assume is the old way of doing
 
04:05:58.750 --> 04:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
it or the other way of doing it no the
 
04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
other way of doing it was a manual
 
04:06:04.990 --> 04:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
form mail by mail basically no they went
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
into a license agent and purchased a
 
04:06:09.309 --> 04:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
license on what was called a
 
04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
multiform and then the and gave the form
 
04:06:15.229 --> 04:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
to a
 
04:06:16.750 --> 04:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
so what happened with the
 
04:06:20.710 --> 04:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
form on a monthly basis they were sent
 
04:06:24.269 --> 04:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
into the New Hampshire fishing game
 
04:06:25.950 --> 04:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
department so they would didn't get
 
04:06:28.830 --> 04:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
their license until the no they had a
 
04:06:31.229 --> 04:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
license they got their license when they
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
purchased their license at an agent they
 
04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
still do that sir they still do that
 
04:06:38.710 --> 04:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
only it's an online platform now rather
 
04:06:40.670 --> 04:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
than a piece of
 
04:06:43.870 --> 04:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
paper yeah go ahead I think that the
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
slight disconnect here is that whether
 
04:06:48.830 --> 04:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
you fill a paper form or where you go
 
04:06:51.510 --> 04:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
online some people may need their
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
handheld I think what the department is
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that they didn't have
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
to do it because whoever was selling the
 
04:06:59.469 --> 04:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
licenses was doing the handholding while
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
in this case the handholding would
 
04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
become a Department's problem again
 
04:07:04.590 --> 04:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding what you're
 
04:07:07.269 --> 04:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
saying I haven't yet bought one so I
 
04:07:09.630 --> 04:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
cannot claim any expertise whatsoever on
 
04:07:12.550 --> 04:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
the topic I was looking classes up this
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
morning so soon or later I will be a
 
04:07:17.830 --> 04:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
customer but just to you know clarify a
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
little okay so if we're not gaining
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
anything from out of state people as we
 
04:07:26.910 --> 04:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
were led to believe we're going to and
 
04:07:29.950 --> 04:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's been 2018 was the last time that we
 
04:07:33.910 --> 04:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
raised our fees by $10 you're you're
 
04:07:36.750 --> 04:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
combining two different things 2018 was
 
04:07:39.149 --> 04:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
the last time we raise fees for licenses
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
we were talking ohrv
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
registrations okay so I'm a little
 
04:07:46.269 --> 04:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
confused okay I guess I should have CL I
 
04:07:48.429 --> 04:07:48.439 align:start position:0%
so given the difference between
 
04:07:51.109 --> 04:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
so and ohrv assume includes snowmobiles
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
or the snow is a separate thing yes it
 
04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
does that doesn't okay then when was the
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
last time you raised ohrv snowmobile
 
04:08:01.590 --> 04:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
license fees oh they have gone up
 
04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
recently actually there was just a two
 
04:08:06.349 --> 04:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
or threee increase where they increased
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
a little
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
bit in each year um the agent fee went
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
from $3 to $4 to
 
04:08:19.109 --> 04:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
five can I assume the agent fee will is
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
gone when you're doing online purchases
 
04:08:23.950 --> 04:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
no it is not who who's the agent the
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
agent is our online vendor and that is
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
how they earn money for providing the
 
04:08:31.670 --> 04:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
online platform for us to be able to
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
sell online so you're not using
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
our department Our IT department to no
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely not and why is that because
 
04:08:42.269 --> 04:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
they could not do
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
it h H we told that Ken yeah that yeah
 
04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
right I don't hearing all that I the it
 
04:08:52.670 --> 04:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
was I heard about a years ago was
 
04:08:55.349 --> 04:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
anticipated it would be doing it we
 
04:08:57.630 --> 04:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
wondered why it took so long we told 18
 
04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
months at
 
04:09:03.550 --> 04:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
time never remember hearing about
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
dncr was that customary before we put it
 
04:09:10.469 --> 04:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
online dncr gets a very large piece of
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
it's partially the trail maintenance
 
04:09:20.109 --> 04:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
work they administer grants out to
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
snowmobile clubs for helping with the
 
04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
trail yes right
 
04:09:27.870 --> 04:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
yes so so for somebody like me was a
 
04:09:30.830 --> 04:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
beginner can you break down the ohrv
 
04:09:33.750 --> 04:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
fee can I break it down for you yeah you
 
04:09:36.550 --> 04:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
said a bunch of goes to the to the agent
 
04:09:38.070 --> 04:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
could just give me the actual breakdown
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
what goes how what is the total what's
 
04:09:40.990 --> 04:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
the registration fee and how's it broken
 
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
down the registration fee we have at
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
least a dozen 15 different types
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
understand pick one okay pick a common
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
one I'm sorry but I cannot do that yeah
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
I don't have no detail I I I've seen a
 
04:09:59.109 --> 04:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
few come in
 
04:10:02.710 --> 04:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
um the the fee itself is like $34 we
 
04:10:08.870 --> 04:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:11.630 --> 04:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I will be happy to provide you
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
with more detail on that I don't have
 
04:10:16.109 --> 04:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
depends upon the registration itself if
 
04:10:19.710 --> 04:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
you belong to a club it's $30 less than
 
04:10:22.830 --> 04:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
if you don't belong to a club your
 
04:10:25.870 --> 04:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
antique is a different price than your
 
04:10:28.229 --> 04:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
non- antique there's all these nuances
 
04:10:32.750 --> 04:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:45.030 --> 04:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:45.040 --> 04:10:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
States

04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:01.149 --> 04:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
inre we heard two years ago well we're
 
04:11:03.030 --> 04:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
certainly going to try well well hang on
 
04:11:05.309 --> 04:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
so but this this could be good news so
 
04:11:06.670 --> 04:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
basically you're saying no outut ofers
 
04:11:09.189 --> 04:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
are coming to buy these things so it
 
04:11:11.229 --> 04:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
would really not hurt we did not say
 
04:11:14.830 --> 04:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
that well no I do want to clarify it I'm
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
not saying that we don't have out ofate
 
04:11:20.189 --> 04:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
snowmobilers coming okay what we were
 
04:11:22.189 --> 04:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
saying is we're not anticipating an
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
increase in that so I just want to be
 
04:11:26.590 --> 04:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
clear on that we do have out ofate folks
 
04:11:28.349 --> 04:11:28.359 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire to enjoy what we
 
04:11:30.830 --> 04:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
have to offer here um but we're not
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
anticipating a huge influx that's going
 
04:11:35.309 --> 04:11:35.319 align:start position:0%
to all of a sudden generate this great
 
04:11:37.550 --> 04:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's you know going to offset
 
04:11:39.870 --> 04:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
all this I'm hoping that that is the
 
04:11:41.550 --> 04:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
case that would be wonderful to bring
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
more people here and okay
 
04:11:44.159 --> 04:11:47.109 align:start position:0%
more people here and okay
Andover

04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
Andover
 
04:11:49.870 --> 04:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
cost thank you uh can I just clarify
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
because all of a sudden it seems a
 
04:11:52.229 --> 04:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
little bit clouded the difference
 
04:11:54.750 --> 04:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
between registration and license uh when
 
04:11:56.830 --> 04:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
they're registering their
 
04:11:59.309 --> 04:11:59.319 align:start position:0%
snowmobile um someone from New York
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
coming here they get a registration they
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
have to register their snowmobile in New
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or can they use their
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
registered snowmobile from New York and
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
if they come over here is there a
 
04:12:11.309 --> 04:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
license or a fee that they have to pay
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
in order to use their snowmobile in New
 
04:12:15.030 --> 04:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is a I'm a little
 
04:12:17.309 --> 04:12:17.319 align:start position:0%
confused about registration versus
 
04:12:22.750 --> 04:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
license a license is for hunting and
 
04:12:27.510 --> 04:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
fishing a registration is for ohrv and
 
04:12:27.520 --> 04:12:29.070 align:start position:0%
fishing a registration is for ohrv and
ATV

04:12:29.070 --> 04:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
ATV
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
vehicles so it it acts as a license it
 
04:12:34.229 --> 04:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
acts as a license so it's not they're
 
04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
not registering their vehicle here
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
they're registering it in New York but
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
the registration is their usage fee here
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
04:12:43.870 --> 04:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
exactly you're welcome okay so I'm going
 
04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
to ask the question a different
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
way it sounds like a fishing game gets
 
04:12:52.269 --> 04:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
just just numbers You' ble left so far
 
04:12:54.910 --> 04:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
less than 50% of
 
04:12:57.550 --> 04:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
the registration fee across the board
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
and and I don't care about exact numbers
 
04:13:01.469 --> 04:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
but my point is this why don't we just
 
04:13:03.309 --> 04:13:03.319 align:start position:0%
double and triple
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
the the portion of that that goes to F
 
04:13:09.710 --> 04:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
fishing game to get a new Total so if it
 
04:13:12.550 --> 04:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
was $34 and you got 10 now it would be
 
04:13:14.950 --> 04:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know 4 4 or $54 of which You' get 20
 
04:13:14.960 --> 04:13:18.950 align:start position:0%
you know 4 4 or $54 of which You' get 20
or

04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
30 again that that would have to be done
 
04:13:24.269 --> 04:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
through legislation oh I understand how
 
04:13:25.389 --> 04:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
it has to be done I'm asking you what
 
04:13:28.349 --> 04:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
the impact would be so the impact of
 
04:13:32.990 --> 04:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
that is would not have any effect at all
 
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
on where our problem is our problem is
 
04:13:39.429 --> 04:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
with the unrestricted fishing game fund
 
04:13:43.510 --> 04:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
the ohrv program is dedicated it is part
 
04:13:46.710 --> 04:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
of a the 16 dedicated accounts that we
 
04:13:48.990 --> 04:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
have in the department and those funds
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
can only be used for ohrv activities
 
04:13:54.910 --> 04:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
it's a like a game we're playing here
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay fair fair enough I'm learning as we
 
04:13:59.469 --> 04:13:59.479 align:start position:0%
go this is great so I guess I should
 
04:14:02.710 --> 04:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
have asked about the fishing license and
 
04:14:04.910 --> 04:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
hunting license are those unrest what
 
04:14:06.710 --> 04:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
goes into the unrestricted
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
funds give me I mean just give me a big
 
04:14:13.149 --> 04:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
one not all of them fishing licenses 4 $
 
04:14:16.870 --> 04:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
4 from a resident fishing license goes
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
into the unrestricted fund okay now that
 
04:14:24.750 --> 04:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
$44 of how much is the whole license fee
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
47 oh so in that case you get more than
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
the ohrv case absolutely but the fishing
 
04:14:32.990 --> 04:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
but the fishing license is also
 
04:14:37.189 --> 04:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
purchased online can be yes it is so why
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
is it so costly to get an ohrv
 
04:14:41.469 --> 04:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
registration online versus getting a
 
04:14:44.229 --> 04:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
fishing license online our fishing and
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
hunting license online platform was
 
04:14:50.030 --> 04:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
developed many years ago and we paid for
 
04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
it back then already paid it's already
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
bought and paid for hang on but you're
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
now you're you're back to that whole
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
upfront fee I get that whole thing but
 
04:14:59.070 --> 04:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
then I asked you if the ongoing cost was
 
04:15:01.870 --> 04:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
then lower and you said no not to
 
04:15:04.790 --> 04:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
administer it here in the department no
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
it is not going to be lower where is the
 
04:15:11.070 --> 04:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:13.870 --> 04:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
administered it's in the department so
 
04:15:15.469 --> 04:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
you see what I'm leading up to here yeah
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
I think we're going I think we're
 
04:15:19.149 --> 04:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
getting very off track no we're not at
 
04:15:21.030 --> 04:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
all I think we're running into a serious
 
04:15:22.670 --> 04:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
problem with the way things are being
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
run well so to back up so I think the
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
the key is we have many dedicated funds
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
that and we have some unrestricted right
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted is where we have the
 
04:15:37.109 --> 04:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
the issue right the concern that I have
 
04:15:38.950 --> 04:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
or the thoughts that I have had about
 
04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
these funds is I'm wondering if there
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
isn't an Avenue to to look at these
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
restricted funds differently can we is
 
04:15:50.189 --> 04:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
there a way to say maybe there's a cap
 
04:15:52.750 --> 04:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
on the amount of money and at a certain
 
04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
point in each restricted fund there's an
 
04:15:58.990 --> 04:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
ability to draw down an X percentage or
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
the the remainder to the unrestricted
 
04:16:03.550 --> 04:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
fund that's one Avenue to think about
 
04:16:04.950 --> 04:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay hang on and and I totally agree
 
04:16:06.510 --> 04:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
with that in fact I'm I've already
 
04:16:08.109 --> 04:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
thought that I'm just unrestrict these
 
04:16:10.590 --> 04:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
things which okay so I'm on board with
 
04:16:13.229 --> 04:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
that don't get me wrong yeah but but but
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
but even separate from that the question
 
04:16:16.590 --> 04:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand whether they're
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
restricted or unrestricted it sounds
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
like what you're telling me is that in
 
04:16:22.630 --> 04:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
the case of fishing licenses for example
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
you do them online and you capture most
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
of that funding to whether it's an
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
unrestricted or restricted fund fishing
 
04:16:31.109 --> 04:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
game captures most of that funding
 
04:16:33.630 --> 04:16:33.640 align:start position:0%
whereas in the case of the ohrv even
 
04:16:35.109 --> 04:16:35.119 align:start position:0%
though it may be going into into a
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
restricted place you capture less than a
 
04:16:41.469 --> 04:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
third of that funding and yet they're
 
04:16:44.469 --> 04:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
both basically online platforms ident
 
04:16:46.109 --> 04:16:46.119 align:start position:0%
they should be identical in terms of
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
their operations I understand there
 
04:16:49.790 --> 04:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
could be an upfront cost although don't
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
first of all I don't understand why the
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game well excuse me while the
 
04:16:56.149 --> 04:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
fishing and hunting license part is
 
04:16:58.630 --> 04:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
managed by fish and game if I understand
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
that correctly no it's managed by our
 
04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
online vendor as well same vendor
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
different yes same vendor we're going
 
04:17:05.830 --> 04:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
through the same vendor it's going to
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
run on the same type of platform okay
 
04:17:11.229 --> 04:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
that's good news so can we expect then
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
that in the future they would not be
 
04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
getting such a high percentage of the
 
04:17:18.990 --> 04:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
total fee so our online vendor sir is
 
04:17:23.550 --> 04:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
not getting a percentage of the
 
04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
fee the the majority of
 
04:17:33.109 --> 04:17:33.119 align:start position:0%
ohrv registration funds is transferred
 
04:17:33.119 --> 04:17:33.990 align:start position:0%
ohrv registration funds is transferred
to

04:17:33.990 --> 04:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
dncr which is what department of
 
04:17:40.630 --> 04:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
resources and natural development it
 
04:17:43.070 --> 04:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
used to be DN Department natural
 
04:17:43.080 --> 04:17:44.309 align:start position:0%
used to be DN Department natural

04:17:44.309 --> 04:17:44.319 align:start position:0%

bureau
 
04:17:59.950 --> 04:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
if so just to summarize I understand
 
04:18:01.710 --> 04:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
this correctly there is a significant
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
difference in the way we uh the
 
04:18:05.590 --> 04:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
legislature Define the use of the
 
04:18:07.149 --> 04:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
revenues that you are getting in the
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
sense that you know the hunting fishing
 
04:18:11.550 --> 04:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
you get to get most of it while for the
 
04:18:14.109 --> 04:18:14.119 align:start position:0%
ohvs they designate that a big chunk of
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
what you guys get moves into this other
 
04:18:19.229 --> 04:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
you know entity who then starts
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
dispensing various grants to maintain
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
trails and whatnot right correct what I
 
04:18:27.389 --> 04:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
would appreciate understanding
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
is what what is the fee structure
 
04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
through the same vendor for a hunting
 
04:18:34.990 --> 04:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
fishing license versus a
 
04:18:38.149 --> 04:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
ohrv cuz if I recall correctly they get
 
04:18:41.670 --> 04:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
what $123 per hunting fishing license
 
04:18:44.309 --> 04:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
and I think you said about 5 for an ohrv
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
can you help me I will please currently
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
in law they you are exactly right it is
 
04:18:55.790 --> 04:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
$1 per license type is retained by the
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
agent so for our licensing platform our
 
04:19:04.510 --> 04:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
online vendor is an agent and they
 
04:19:08.910 --> 04:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
retain $1 per license type
 
04:19:14.429 --> 04:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
sold they also retain a $2 transaction
 
04:19:17.710 --> 04:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
fee that is what funds them other than
 
04:19:20.469 --> 04:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
upfront cost of when the program was
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
developed we do not have any ongoing
 
04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
cost with our online vendor that is how
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
they earn their money for the ohrv
 
04:19:29.040 --> 04:19:30.630 align:start position:0%
they earn their money for the ohrv
registration

04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
registration
 
04:19:32.550 --> 04:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
program in
 
04:19:36.389 --> 04:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
statute the agent fee is
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
$5 per
 
04:19:43.630 --> 04:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
registration so if you register a sled
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
to go up north you pay that agent at the
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
store or at fishing game $5 can you
 
04:19:54.349 --> 04:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
explain why there's a difference there
 
04:19:56.550 --> 04:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
that is how the law is written there's
 
04:20:01.630 --> 04:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
lobbyists who come in and they it's it's
 
04:20:03.790 --> 04:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
statut it didn't come from fishing game
 
04:20:03.800 --> 04:20:05.109 align:start position:0%
statut it didn't come from fishing game
it's

04:20:05.109 --> 04:20:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:20:07.309 --> 04:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
statutory okay so what impact would it
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
have if we change that to a
 
04:20:12.950 --> 04:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
buck or or to the same it's the same
 
04:20:14.349 --> 04:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
person it's the same organization
 
04:20:16.830 --> 04:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
correct well well if you'd let me finish
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
with um representative Papi's
 
04:20:24.269 --> 04:20:24.279 align:start position:0%
question when we bring this online in
 
04:20:28.309 --> 04:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
September part of our contract is to
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
retain at the department $4 of that
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
transaction fee so that our online
 
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
vendor is going to continue with the
 
04:20:41.950 --> 04:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
just the $1 fee just like they have now
 
04:20:44.750 --> 04:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
with licens is and that's going to allow
 
04:20:47.790 --> 04:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
us to help offset the cost of running
 
04:20:49.269 --> 04:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
the program
 
04:20:53.950 --> 04:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
internally so we've actually become more
 
04:20:56.630 --> 04:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
efficient we found a way to earn some
 
04:21:00.550 --> 04:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
money so if I may the so basically that
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
means that once we get out of the
 
04:21:07.550 --> 04:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
one-time costs yes if you guys can get
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
by without hiring a new person to
 
04:21:11.790 --> 04:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
support this this may benefit the
 
04:21:13.950 --> 04:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
department over all because you would
 
04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
now get in the past you got your $5 when
 
04:21:19.389 --> 04:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
somebody registered directly with you
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
guys but that didn't happen a lot
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
correct most people just go wherever in
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
the field they are correct now most all
 
04:21:28.870 --> 04:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
online transactions you get to keep four
 
04:21:28.880 --> 04:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
online transactions you get to keep four
out

04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
of5 which hopefully you know would be a
 
04:21:36.469 --> 04:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
net benefit compared with how it was in
 
04:21:38.109 --> 04:21:38.119 align:start position:0%
the past and that's assuming the same
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
level of registration is nothing
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
changing even though I will agree that I
 
04:21:45.389 --> 04:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
have also been told while I was not on
 
04:21:48.429 --> 04:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal but I remember being told that
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah this is going to be a boosting out
 
04:21:53.070 --> 04:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
of state registrations and all that be
 
04:21:54.910 --> 04:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
that as it may whatever was said was
 
04:21:56.670 --> 04:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
said you guys were not necessarily
 
04:22:02.590 --> 04:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
saying that it is understood so even at
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
a flat no change in the registrations
 
04:22:07.710 --> 04:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
this should still once we go past the
 
04:22:10.389 --> 04:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
initial stuff initial you know upfront
 
04:22:12.510 --> 04:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
expenses they should benefit the
 
04:22:14.349 --> 04:22:14.359 align:start position:0%
Department financially even if we don't
 
04:22:15.269 --> 04:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
get new
 
04:22:17.429 --> 04:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
registrations unless you guys have to
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
hire more people to help out you know
 
04:22:22.590 --> 04:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
going above and beyond what you're
 
04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
getting I'm just trying to understand
 
04:22:26.830 --> 04:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
financially you know whether this is a
 
04:22:28.510 --> 04:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
good program to continue or not because
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
frankly if you're telling me just it's
 
04:22:32.229 --> 04:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
just money down the drain it's not that
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
hard to cut it so for the upcoming banal
 
04:22:38.910 --> 04:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
budget we increased class 20
 
04:22:41.950 --> 04:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
specifically to cover Postage and
 
04:22:41.960 --> 04:22:42.990 align:start position:0%
specifically to cover Postage and
shipping

04:22:42.990 --> 04:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
shipping
 
04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the decals that we're going to have
 
04:22:47.269 --> 04:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
to send out to the people who purchase
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
online right y people who are driving up
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
Route 93 on a Friday from out of state
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
and they go and purchase a registration
 
04:22:58.149 --> 04:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
online they're still going to have to
 
04:22:59.790 --> 04:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
wait for that
 
04:23:03.109 --> 04:23:03.119 align:start position:0%
decal so we have to do the Fulfillment
 
04:23:05.429 --> 04:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
at the agency it's very different than a
 
04:23:07.469 --> 04:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
paper hunting or fishing license that
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
you go online you buy your license you
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
print off a piece of paper that's your
 
04:23:15.870 --> 04:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
license I hear you but if I may I just
 
04:23:17.229 --> 04:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
want to make sure since I've never had
 
04:23:20.590 --> 04:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
an ATV and or an A or you know or a
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
snowmobile and nor am I planning to get
 
04:23:26.309 --> 04:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
one at my age um you are saying that if
 
04:23:29.790 --> 04:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
I drive in with a snowmobile and I want
 
04:23:31.550 --> 04:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
to use it in New Hampshire now I got to
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
wait for the decal you cannot get the
 
04:23:36.030 --> 04:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
decal when you pay at an agent how you
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
can if you pay an agent absolutely at an
 
04:23:40.189 --> 04:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
agent I'm not talking online online is
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
online supposedly you new three weeks
 
04:23:44.070 --> 04:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
ahead of time you're going to go to New
 
04:23:45.389 --> 04:23:45.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you do it you wait for the
 
04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
mail it comes in but if I would go to an
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
agent I can pick up my decal on the
 
04:23:53.469 --> 04:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
sport cuz they have deals there
 
04:23:55.229 --> 04:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely that makes much more sense
 
04:23:56.830 --> 04:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
than what I thought I was hearing thank
 
04:23:59.590 --> 04:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
you for uh confirming I'm good well it
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to me you could no
 
04:24:04.109 --> 04:24:04.119 align:start position:0%
reason you couldn't print out a
 
04:24:06.510 --> 04:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
license you can print out a license
 
04:24:08.950 --> 04:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
can't print out a decal with it's a
 
04:24:10.990 --> 04:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
sticker it attaches to the it attaches
 
04:24:13.269 --> 04:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
to the machine yeah it attaches to the
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
unit and to say it will cause additional
 
04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement concerns to say because
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
everybody can easily say oh well I had
 
04:24:22.349 --> 04:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
it on there but I must have lost it in
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
the field or it's in the mail you know
 
04:24:30.269 --> 04:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
y yeah is it possible that if they have
 
04:24:31.950 --> 04:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
their receipt they could go to an agent
 
04:24:33.309 --> 04:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
once they get here and just get their
 
04:24:35.550 --> 04:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
sticker is that possible at this point
 
04:24:38.590 --> 04:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
it is not that is one Avenue that we are
 
04:24:40.830 --> 04:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
considering might help huh right
 
04:24:43.710 --> 04:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
inventory is sent up out specifically to
 
04:24:45.950 --> 04:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
each agent and the inventory of course
 
04:24:49.149 --> 04:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
has to be accounted for so agents have a
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
predetermined inventory that they are
 
04:24:51.479 --> 04:24:54.790 align:start position:0%
predetermined inventory that they are
responsible

04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:58.109 --> 04:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
for yeah go ahead representative thank
 
04:24:59.710 --> 04:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
you was there a
 
04:25:02.229 --> 04:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding um around this program
 
04:25:06.109 --> 04:25:06.119 align:start position:0%
with did you expect the large chunk of
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
money was going to go to resources as
 
04:25:10.510 --> 04:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to staying in fishing game and I
 
04:25:12.309 --> 04:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
realized I guess resources uses it for
 
04:25:14.189 --> 04:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
for its programs but was there a little
 
04:25:16.229 --> 04:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
disconnect between where the larger
 
04:25:19.070 --> 04:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
chunk of money was going to go no it's
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
always been this way as long as I've
 
04:25:23.109 --> 04:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
been with fish and G transfers have gone
 
04:25:26.990 --> 04:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
over to dncr of around 70 to 72% of
 
04:25:29.309 --> 04:25:29.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue even though you're doing pretty
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
much even though we do the registration
 
04:25:31.680 --> 04:25:34.109 align:start position:0%
much even though we do the registration
program

04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:25:36.990 --> 04:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
yes what our say is
 
04:25:40.070 --> 04:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
that we can look in our oh okay you
 
04:25:41.109 --> 04:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to look it up right now just
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
get it to me after the fact is fine well
 
04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's listed in our dedicated
 
04:25:48.990 --> 04:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
accounts the
 
04:25:52.109 --> 04:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
RSA ohrv is RSA
 
04:25:56.349 --> 04:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.510 --> 04:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
23 just a fair warning to the committee
 
04:26:02.309 --> 04:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
that's one of the hardest rsas to read
 
04:26:04.510 --> 04:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
and follow when when you get to it but
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's easy to repeal it it could be easy
 
04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
to repeal yes but you'll see it's a very
 
04:26:12.030 --> 04:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
complex uh funding stream that comes in
 
04:26:14.109 --> 04:26:14.119 align:start position:0%
and how it's directed and like the
 
04:26:15.910 --> 04:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
department was saying there's many
 
04:26:17.710 --> 04:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
different types of registrations and
 
04:26:18.990 --> 04:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
when you get to that RSA and then
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
there's a snowmobile one too um it's
 
04:26:22.000 --> 04:26:23.790 align:start position:0%
there's a snowmobile one too um it's
quite

04:26:23.790 --> 04:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
quite
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
complex but uh so I I would like to get
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
from you not right now but for all of
 
04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
these different bees licenses whatever
 
04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
are the synonyms you have for those
 
04:26:38.269 --> 04:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
kinds of things um what the what the
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
fees are and what the breakdown is of f
 
04:26:44.710 --> 04:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
to the agent funding to whatever funding
 
04:26:46.830 --> 04:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
to fishing game because I speciically
 
04:26:49.790 --> 04:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
for ohrv no no no no for everything all
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
for all components oh okay that's I know
 
04:26:54.750 --> 04:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a partial list probably
 
04:26:57.910 --> 04:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
but no that's unrestricted yeah re I
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
want restricted as
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
well I want to know so I understand that
 
04:27:06.990 --> 04:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
you are you what you've been telling us
 
04:27:07.000 --> 04:27:07.870 align:start position:0%
you are you what you've been telling us
is

04:27:07.870 --> 04:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
that you're short funds and am I'm not
 
04:27:13.389 --> 04:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
hearing that correctly
 
04:27:15.670 --> 04:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
we are short unrestricted fishing game
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
funds yes we are okay so I would like to
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
try to help to alleviate that problem
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
but not doing it through General funds
 
04:27:26.429 --> 04:27:26.439 align:start position:0%
I'd rather doing do it through usage
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
fees which seems to be the way to go in
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
my opinion agree uh and without an
 
04:27:34.189 --> 04:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
understanding which clearly I do not
 
04:27:36.910 --> 04:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
have I'll admit it and you can laugh at
 
04:27:39.550 --> 04:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
me it's fine I'm I'm on board with that
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
um but without that as a place to begin
 
04:27:43.630 --> 04:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be difficult to figure out
 
04:27:45.670 --> 04:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
how to how to work through it but that's
 
04:27:47.670 --> 04:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get input from you all and
 
04:27:50.269 --> 04:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
the best way to increase fees to
 
04:27:54.269 --> 04:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
increase your uh unrestricted funds to
 
04:27:57.389 --> 04:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
fund fishing game yes sir R and just on
 
04:28:02.710 --> 04:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:05.229 --> 04:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
right I mean I've been here last year
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
and I cannot claim I can I can say that
 
04:28:10.990 --> 04:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
I have a general understanding but if
 
04:28:13.189 --> 04:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
you'd uh start quizzing me on the
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
various fees and various breakdowns I
 
04:28:17.590 --> 04:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
would be lost within 15 seconds so I
 
04:28:20.510 --> 04:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
think when you do a budget like this and
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's such a complicated environment that
 
04:28:25.469 --> 04:28:25.479 align:start position:0%
you guys work in well if we don't
 
04:28:26.830 --> 04:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
understand how it works how in God's
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
name are we going to fix it correctly so
 
04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
I know it's going to be quite a bit of
 
04:28:32.469 --> 04:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
work to get that breakdown on you know
 
04:28:34.469 --> 04:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
think of it this way think about the
 
04:28:36.910 --> 04:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
life of a dollar as it comes in and goes
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
out of you know
 
04:28:42.269 --> 04:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
this every dollar that comes in on a
 
04:28:45.269 --> 04:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
hunting license so so much of it goes to
 
04:28:46.750 --> 04:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
the agent fees so much goes to the
 
04:28:48.830 --> 04:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
unrestricted fine look at the revenues
 
04:28:51.550 --> 04:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
right never mind the expenditures but
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
then we get into registrations totally
 
04:28:55.469 --> 04:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
different thing and again you had a
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
bunch of different Revenue sources all
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
of which go into unrestricted presumably
 
04:29:03.030 --> 04:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
all of those may have similar stories
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
right where you know so much of the uh
 
04:29:10.030 --> 04:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
license we talked about the agents agent
 
04:29:12.189 --> 04:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
fees are clear right that's the one that
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
you actually get the whole thing and
 
04:29:16.389 --> 04:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
there is no need for a
 
04:29:19.389 --> 04:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
story you know court fines and penalties
 
04:29:20.990 --> 04:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay I guess there is not a lot of story
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
but basically we need to understand what
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
comes in what are the different cuts
 
04:29:26.910 --> 04:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
that go where what is currently
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
restricted that maybe doesn't need to be
 
04:29:31.469 --> 04:29:31.479 align:start position:0%
restricted so there may be parts of what
 
04:29:33.670 --> 04:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
you do that are currently restricted
 
04:29:35.429 --> 04:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
because the legislature in the wisdom
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
decreed so but the agency feels that
 
04:29:40.590 --> 04:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
maybe there is a reasonable case to be
 
04:29:42.510 --> 04:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
made that revenue or at least part of
 
04:29:46.750 --> 04:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue does not need to be restricted
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
and you know if you guys keep saying
 
04:29:50.710 --> 04:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
that we have we are fine on the
 
04:29:52.630 --> 04:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
restricted Revenue but we really have a
 
04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
shortage on the unrestricted at least
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
part of the solution has to be examined
 
04:29:59.830 --> 04:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
as which of your restricted revenues
 
04:30:01.149 --> 04:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be restricted or it
 
04:30:02.950 --> 04:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
generates revenues in excess of what you
 
04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
need to spend so some of it could be
 
04:30:07.389 --> 04:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
unrestricted I know I'm I'm good I no I
 
04:30:09.309 --> 04:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I fully agree with you so
 
04:30:12.630 --> 04:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
if I may sir um so let's back up a
 
04:30:15.229 --> 04:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
little bit first off the licenses the
 
04:30:17.830 --> 04:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
licenses are covered under rule and we
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
have the authority to change those
 
04:30:23.710 --> 04:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
license fees they were changed just you
 
04:30:26.830 --> 04:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
know in 2018 we did raise them you see
 
04:30:29.349 --> 04:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
how we compare across the states um
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
there are little areas where I think we
 
04:30:33.670 --> 04:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
can still probably increase like charge
 
04:30:36.030 --> 04:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
for duplicate license things like that
 
04:30:38.429 --> 04:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
smaller incremental changes that won't
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
make significant difference but every
 
04:30:44.429 --> 04:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
little bit counts um as far as the the
 
04:30:47.269 --> 04:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
the place that I see our biggest hold up
 
04:30:50.550 --> 04:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
is in the restricted funds we have money
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
there it's restricted in the use and we
 
04:30:55.469 --> 04:30:55.479 align:start position:0%
those are the areas where we can
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
actually increase fees we have a since
 
04:31:02.670 --> 04:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
19 I think it's 98 the habitat fee has
 
04:31:02.680 --> 04:31:03.790 align:start position:0%
19 I think it's 98 the habitat fee has
been

04:31:03.790 --> 04:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:31:08.830 --> 04:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
$2.50 since 19 something similar 1998 or
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
something our fee related to Fisheries
 
04:31:11.760 --> 04:31:12.469 align:start position:0%
something our fee related to Fisheries
has

04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:31:15.309 --> 04:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
has1 so we have the opportunities to
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
raise those fees but my concern is if we
 
04:31:20.349 --> 04:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
raise them and we can't use them what do
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
we do then right and that's where I
 
04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't know the mechanism but if we could
 
04:31:27.870 --> 04:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
get some help with that that would be
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
suitable for us I know the mechanism
 
04:31:34.149 --> 04:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
okay you know I mean that that's the
 
04:31:36.429 --> 04:31:36.439 align:start position:0%
reality of it yes we have some fees
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
licenses that we can you know change and
 
04:31:40.790 --> 04:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
Tinker with but it's not a significant
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
amount it's these other restricted funds
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
that we could actually generate I mean
 
04:31:48.030 --> 04:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
we I have a list here that I'd be
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
willing to share with you I asked Kathy
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
to pull this really quickly but our
 
04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat fee alone $1
 
04:31:55.119 --> 04:31:57.030 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat fee alone $1
142,5

04:31:57.030 --> 04:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
142,5
 
04:32:00.510 --> 04:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
67 if we just doubled that by doubling
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
the fee and if you look at inflation
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's exactly where we should be on
 
04:32:07.030 --> 04:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
both of these the fisheries and the
 
04:32:11.070 --> 04:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
habitat um the wildlife habitat fee so I
 
04:32:12.990 --> 04:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with you I love that you
 
04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
guys are thinking this way and I'm just
 
04:32:16.990 --> 04:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
honestly I'm new here I'm trying to
 
04:32:18.990 --> 04:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
figure out how do we make this happen
 
04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
and how can we address this back to your
 
04:32:24.710 --> 04:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
point chairman about the ohrv you know
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
given the fact that we do not have
 
04:32:29.070 --> 04:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
General funds necessarily allocated in
 
04:32:31.389 --> 04:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
the current uh proposed budget by the
 
04:32:34.030 --> 04:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
governor um if we were to do anything
 
04:32:34.040 --> 04:32:34.950 align:start position:0%
governor um if we were to do anything
with

04:32:34.950 --> 04:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:32:38.670 --> 04:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
ohrv those funds would help us ensure
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
that we could probably hire an
 
04:32:42.109 --> 04:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
additional conservation office offer
 
04:32:43.510 --> 04:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about right now
 
04:32:45.630 --> 04:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
without having those General funds is we
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
may not be able to hire the five
 
04:32:49.830 --> 04:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
vacancies that we have now granted those
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
those officers would have to be
 
04:32:53.790 --> 04:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
contributed you know to their time to
 
04:32:57.030 --> 04:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
that event and to that specific thing
 
04:32:59.109 --> 04:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless that could help us if we
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
were to raise those those fees and they
 
04:33:05.230 --> 04:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
only have to be applied to that specific
 
04:33:07.390 --> 04:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
thing we left the law as it is again
 
04:33:09.789 --> 04:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
right we can change that so I would
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
you're new I'm new let's get together
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
that sounds good because what you're
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
suggesting sounds fantastic if you could
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
give us those kinds of recommendations
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
um that's exactly what I'm looking for
 
04:33:22.109 --> 04:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry if I'm very Inc
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
convoluted about the way I get to that
 
04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
point but no it's okay and I was trying
 
04:33:28.510 --> 04:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
to jump in a little bit earlier but I I
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
just I didn't want to be interruptive to
 
04:33:33.150 --> 04:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
people's conversations papich and just
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
as a quick Point um when there is a fee
 
04:33:38.910 --> 04:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
that's for a service
 
04:33:41.470 --> 04:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
right I was saying this earlier today in
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
addition different meeting it's kind of
 
04:33:45.869 --> 04:33:45.879 align:start position:0%
bad policy to you know not increase it
 
04:33:48.349 --> 04:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
for 10 years and then have to take a 50%
 
04:33:50.990 --> 04:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
inflation adjustment cuz everybody's
 
04:33:52.590 --> 04:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
going to remember the one time when you
 
04:33:54.670 --> 04:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
increased it to catch up not the nine
 
04:33:56.830 --> 04:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
years when they got a lesser fee because
 
04:33:59.470 --> 04:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
inflation happened so I would suggest
 
04:34:02.189 --> 04:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
that we not only adjust what needs to be
 
04:34:04.869 --> 04:34:04.879 align:start position:0%
adjusting appropriately look at how much
 
04:34:06.670 --> 04:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
of it needs to be restricted and how
 
04:34:10.629 --> 04:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
much it doesn't but then also look at
 
04:34:12.750 --> 04:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
putting into stat whether it's through
 
04:34:14.910 --> 04:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 or through a separate bill to be
 
04:34:17.949 --> 04:34:17.959 align:start position:0%
passed later you know some inflation
 
04:34:20.830 --> 04:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
related fee increases so that there is
 
04:34:22.910 --> 04:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
very clear expectations that hey if
 
04:34:26.230 --> 04:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
there is 3% inflation this feing is
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
going to increase by 3% again it's not
 
04:34:30.869 --> 04:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
your department you cannot do that on
 
04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
road tolls because everybody would hate
 
04:34:34.670 --> 04:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
to have to find three cents to pay a
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
toll but on fees like this that are paid
 
04:34:39.029 --> 04:34:39.039 align:start position:0%
on a
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
transaction it's it it just seems better
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
policy and yet we we don't do it and you
 
04:34:47.230 --> 04:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
know maybe we should consider it again
 
04:34:49.869 --> 04:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
not everywhere but in the right places
 
04:34:53.629 --> 04:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
so thank you chairman
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
wer so we're running a little long on
 
04:34:59.109 --> 04:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
this but I want to come back to a
 
04:35:02.310 --> 04:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
project that took me 10 years to get a
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
hike safe car with a lot of opposition
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:35:09.230 --> 04:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
department now it brings in a lot of
 
04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
money so where do I find that in this
 
04:35:14.830 --> 04:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
budget under accounting unit
 
04:35:23.070 --> 04:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:29.551 --> 04:35:29.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.230 --> 04:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
762 so I have budgeted approximately
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
$300,000 per
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
year in hike safe revenue for the search
 
04:35:44.429 --> 04:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
account where do I see hike safe it's
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
under estimated source of funds for
 
04:35:54.310 --> 04:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
search and rescue under 06 agency
 
04:35:58.429 --> 04:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
income on page 762 towards the bottom of
 
04:35:58.439 --> 04:36:00.551 align:start position:0%
income on page 762 towards the bottom of
the

04:36:00.551 --> 04:36:00.561 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:05.230 --> 04:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
page so on 2025 it
 
04:36:08.310 --> 04:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
only we that the income was only
 
04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
191,000 well that's what's budgeted this
 
04:36:15.750 --> 04:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year however the actual for 24 as
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
you can see was just under 364,000
 
04:36:22.869 --> 04:36:22.879 align:start position:0%
right well we do a budget way ahead of
 
04:36:25.349 --> 04:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
time so it's it's a budget so it's the
 
04:36:27.629 --> 04:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
whole previous year was actuals were
 
04:36:29.789 --> 04:36:29.799 align:start position:0%
were way higher than budgeted so now the
 
04:36:31.470 --> 04:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
remaining budget is lower they'll
 
04:36:33.310 --> 04:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
actually have a significant Surplus in
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
25 they just don't report it yet it's
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
what I was struggling with earlier this
 
04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
morning but years before that we had to
 
04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
put 100,000 extra into search and rescue
 
04:36:45.869 --> 04:36:45.879 align:start position:0%
because it came up short so now it
 
04:36:48.269 --> 04:36:48.279 align:start position:0%
should be almost overfunded so you're
 
04:36:50.750 --> 04:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
finding other ways to use that extra
 
04:36:53.310 --> 04:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
money we're we're not using it for
 
04:36:55.150 --> 04:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
anything other than search and rescue
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
activities search and rescue is one of
 
04:36:59.470 --> 04:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
our dedicated accounts well when I saw
 
04:37:01.750 --> 04:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
the latest a lot of it went in for
 
04:37:04.629 --> 04:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
public discussions and and dive training
 
04:37:06.510 --> 04:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
and other things that went somewhere
 
04:37:06.520 --> 04:37:07.429 align:start position:0%
and other things that went somewhere
else

04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:37:10.629 --> 04:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
once so the funds are dedicated to
 
04:37:13.029 --> 04:37:13.039 align:start position:0%
search and rescue which involves
 
04:37:16.029 --> 04:37:16.039 align:start position:0%
training our officers and our responders
 
04:37:19.830 --> 04:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to do this specialized work
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
um to say it's overfunded sir no I think
 
04:37:24.070 --> 04:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
we're actually right where we need to be
 
04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
I know there have been some proposals
 
04:37:28.390 --> 04:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
for perhaps increasing search and rescue
 
04:37:30.429 --> 04:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
funding I don't think we necessarily
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
need that I kudos to you thank you for
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
the hike saf glad to have some some
 
04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
exess and I want you to understand that
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
once in a while we're not stupid we can
 
04:37:41.789 --> 04:37:41.799 align:start position:0%
figure out we can figure out where money
 
04:37:43.869 --> 04:37:43.879 align:start position:0%
needs to come from I love that and I
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
don't understand why I had all the
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
opposition from the agency I don't
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
either sir I iame I hope that you won't
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
have that experience with me because if
 
04:37:55.109 --> 04:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
anything you'll find out I'm Pie in the
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
Sky I'm I'm always thinking about new
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
and creative way so I'm I'm willing to
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
work with you all but it should Tak me
 
04:38:03.510 --> 04:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
10 years to get that pass 100% the
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
opposition from the agency it wouldn't
 
04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
have taken so
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
long anyway just a point I want to make
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
we're here to help you we're trying to
 
04:38:13.869 --> 04:38:13.879 align:start position:0%
make everything work we're looking at
 
04:38:16.029 --> 04:38:16.039 align:start position:0%
the big picture and sometimes we run
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
into things that don't make sense to us
 
04:38:19.789 --> 04:38:19.799 align:start position:0%
and then when we try to make a
 
04:38:22.189 --> 04:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
suggestion I don't like the fact we've
 
04:38:23.789 --> 04:38:23.799 align:start position:0%
never done that don't bother us you
 
04:38:25.709 --> 04:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
don't know anything oh I hope that
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
you're not receiving or feeling that way
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
today because I'm very open to your
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
ideas and certainly want to hear I mean
 
04:38:33.869 --> 04:38:33.879 align:start position:0%
just want to make a point the more ideas
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
at the table the better way we can get
 
04:38:37.830 --> 04:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
trying to work together absolutely
 
04:38:39.869 --> 04:38:39.879 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you hike safe card
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
is very successful f for our department
 
04:38:44.349 --> 04:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
04:38:48.189 --> 04:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
you represent Dy so going back to these
 
04:38:49.869 --> 04:38:49.879 align:start position:0%
machines and and the groomers are
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
getting $4 of your fee the the license
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
fee registration fee excuse me the
 
04:38:57.150 --> 04:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
registration fee the groomers well the
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
the field the people who actually groom
 
04:39:01.990 --> 04:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
the Feld Trails excuse me no oh no where
 
04:39:04.830 --> 04:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
does that $4 go no that's not the I
 
04:39:08.670 --> 04:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
thought that was $4 $5 agent fee stays
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
with the agent who sold registration
 
04:39:17.310 --> 04:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
okay what what's happening is um I think
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's I don't remember the percentage but
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
a chunk of it does go to dancer for the
 
04:39:24.189 --> 04:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
trails maintenance work oh okay I
 
04:39:26.990 --> 04:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
thought you said $4 went to the trail no
 
04:39:29.629 --> 04:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
the $4 is actually for the the vendor
 
04:39:32.670 --> 04:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
who sending selling the okay all right
 
04:39:35.470 --> 04:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
that cleared that up thank you you're
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:46.830 --> 04:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
all right would you like us to so where
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
would you like me to continue we stopped
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
registrations we did licensing correct
 
04:39:57.070 --> 04:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
2118 okay we can we can so I guess the
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:04.708 --> 04:40:04.718 align:start position:0%
licenses I'm I'm
 
04:40:09.150 --> 04:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
sorry okay so then we have Fleet which
 
04:40:11.070 --> 04:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
is the last accounting unit within the
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
business business division Fleet is a
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
central accounting unit to cover all of
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
our Fleet expenditures that are not part
 
04:40:22.830 --> 04:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
of like a hunter education or aquatic
 
04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
education program which are 100%
 
04:40:25.320 --> 04:40:30.670 align:start position:0%
education program which are 100%
federally

04:40:30.670 --> 04:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
funded I think you'll see that class 20
 
04:40:36.070 --> 04:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
we stayed pretty much with uh current
 
04:40:40.310 --> 04:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
expense class 70 is used exclusively to
 
04:40:44.350 --> 04:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
pay fuel cost cost mostly to do for the
 
04:40:44.360 --> 04:40:45.590 align:start position:0%
pay fuel cost cost mostly to do for the
do

04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:40:57.030 --> 04:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:02.350 --> 04:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
743 and that wraps up the business
 
04:41:04.708 --> 04:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
division then we go on to our public
 
04:41:07.150 --> 04:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
affairs division which is promotions
 
04:41:09.788 --> 04:41:09.798 align:start position:0%
marketing education all of our
 
04:41:09.798 --> 04:41:21.670 align:start position:0%
marketing education all of our
department-wide

04:41:21.670 --> 04:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
media Au 2120 is the main account in
 
04:41:29.270 --> 04:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
public affairs houses most of the people
 
04:41:33.230 --> 04:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
in the account the class line 069 our
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
promotional marketing you'll see a
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
significant increase there it is our
 
04:41:41.708 --> 04:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
desire to engage in more Market in and
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
department the next one down is aquatic
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
resources education which the M tell
 
04:42:00.070 --> 04:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
745 sorry aquatic Ed and the one
 
04:42:08.070 --> 04:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
underneath at Hunter Ed 2121 are both
 
04:42:10.230 --> 04:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
very similar these are education
 
04:42:12.868 --> 04:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
programs that are primarily funded with
 
04:42:16.390 --> 04:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
federal funds Hunter education is on
 
04:42:16.400 --> 04:42:21.830 align:start position:0%
federal funds Hunter education is on
746

04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:25.150 --> 04:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
y moving to down on
 
04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
7:47 we have Wildlife Conservation
 
04:42:31.350 --> 04:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
education this um just pays for one
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
full-time employee who is dedicated to
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
conser Wildlife Conservation especially
 
04:42:41.550 --> 04:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
in our schools and with students budget
 
04:42:45.030 --> 04:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
shows two I'm sorry budget shows two one
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
of them is unfunded oh one's unfunded
 
04:42:50.430 --> 04:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
okay one is unfunded yes there are two
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
unfunded moving on to 748 the wildlife
 
04:43:03.830 --> 04:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
program the first accounting unit is
 
04:43:06.390 --> 04:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
2125 which is non-game species
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
management which we have touched upon a
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
little bit this is one of our dedicated
 
04:43:15.190 --> 04:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
accounts the wildlife division has the
 
04:43:17.830 --> 04:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
most dedicated accounts within the
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
department as far as
 
04:43:23.470 --> 04:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
divisions meaning that there are no
 
04:43:32.150 --> 04:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
accounts the next one down which starts
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of 749 but is mostly on
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
750 is the wildlife program management
 
04:43:45.030 --> 04:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
which houses most people outside of the
 
04:43:47.708 --> 04:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
non-game program within the wildlife
 
04:43:49.948 --> 04:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
Division and this does have a small
 
04:43:52.910 --> 04:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
amount of fishing game funds within it
 
04:43:55.990 --> 04:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
but a large component of this accounting
 
04:44:03.470 --> 04:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
will keep going okay so down on 751 we
 
04:44:11.470 --> 04:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
have pheasant and there's only one class
 
04:44:13.910 --> 04:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
line in our pheasant account and that is
 
04:44:17.708 --> 04:44:17.718 align:start position:0%
to purchase pheasants in the RSA clearly
 
04:44:20.910 --> 04:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
states that funds received from the sale
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
of these permits and funds within this
 
04:44:25.868 --> 04:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
account can only be used for the
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:39.310 --> 04:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:42.788 --> 04:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
yes that's
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's fund it's aant F it's the Pheasant
 
04:44:46.320 --> 04:44:48.750 align:start position:0%
it's fund it's aant F it's the Pheasant
fund

04:44:48.750 --> 04:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:44:52.390 --> 04:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
yes it's on my list of 16 dedicated
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
accounts under Au 2153 and you would see
 
04:44:57.310 --> 04:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
there halfway down on the same page 751
 
04:45:03.030 --> 04:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
we have the game management account
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
which also is a dedicated account there
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
are no full-time people in here we do
 
04:45:12.310 --> 04:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
have a small amount of over time which
 
04:45:15.510 --> 04:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
is utilized to man moose and deer check
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:27.990 --> 04:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
fall so moving
 
04:45:32.030 --> 04:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
on about twoth thirds down page 752 is
 
04:45:34.670 --> 04:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
the wildlife damage AB abatement it's a
 
04:45:36.910 --> 04:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
very small account and it's
 
04:45:39.788 --> 04:45:39.798 align:start position:0%
only one of two accounts within this
 
04:45:41.590 --> 04:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
entire division
 
04:45:44.310 --> 04:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
that has a portion of fishing game funds
 
04:45:47.430 --> 04:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
in it we have one full-time person and
 
04:45:51.150 --> 04:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
this person sits at USDA for the most
 
04:45:54.910 --> 04:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
part and they are involved in the bare
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation and bare complaints human
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
Wildlife conflict issues human Wildlife
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
you say it's so much better than me I
 
04:46:05.070 --> 04:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
used to run that
 
04:46:07.310 --> 04:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
program that's why she's the director
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:14.670 --> 04:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
on page 753 we have the wildlife habitat
 
04:46:16.430 --> 04:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
conservation and we were talking about
 
04:46:19.788 --> 04:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
the $2.50 wildlife habitat fee that has
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
been the same since
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
1998 that in conjunction with federal
 
04:46:28.190 --> 04:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
funds fund this program there is one
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
full-time person who works as a wildlife
 
04:46:33.910 --> 04:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
habitat conservation biologist within
 
04:46:33.920 --> 04:46:35.310 align:start position:0%
habitat conservation biologist within
this

04:46:35.310 --> 04:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:46:38.670 --> 04:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
account as you can see for fiscal year
 
04:46:42.030 --> 04:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
24 actual expense almost $3 million in
 
04:46:43.948 --> 04:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
land Acquisitions and
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
easements that was for land purchases
 
04:46:50.230 --> 04:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
and we don't budget too heavily within
 
04:46:51.910 --> 04:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
that account because we don't have a
 
04:46:54.390 --> 04:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
crystal ball we don't we don't know
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
what's coming down the line what is
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
going to be available to us to be able
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
to purchase and typically when that
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity comes along there are
 
04:47:05.470 --> 04:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
federal funds that come along with it
 
04:47:07.230 --> 04:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
and we would do an accept an expend
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
through fiscal to increase that class
 
04:47:10.160 --> 04:47:11.470 align:start position:0%
through fiscal to increase that class
line

04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
and what was that
 
04:47:15.830 --> 04:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
fund wildlife habitat conservation page
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
753 no I've got that but that's also the
 
04:47:21.548 --> 04:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
name of the fund yes it
 
04:47:24.510 --> 04:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
is just so everyone is aware the table
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the department put also has a
 
04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
column for accounting unit so it's a
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
good crosswalk to go from the budget to
 
04:47:32.948 --> 04:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund to the RSA I don't
 
04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the accounting units
 
04:47:35.110 --> 04:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
I've got those what I'm trying to
 
04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
associate with the dedicated fund names
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
that is the name yeah no I got that but
 
04:47:43.150 --> 04:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
that's but that's not in the budget
 
04:47:47.070 --> 04:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.070 --> 04:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
division seeing no questions we'll go on
 
04:48:01.270 --> 04:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
to page 755 which starts the Inland
 
04:48:08.830 --> 04:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:12.270 --> 04:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
management nothing extraordinary to talk
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
about there I don't
 
04:48:19.628 --> 04:48:19.638 align:start position:0%
think sure um is the the um large amount
 
04:48:21.548 --> 04:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
of benefits on line 60 is that the same
 
04:48:22.948 --> 04:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
issue as what you had before for the
 
04:48:25.990 --> 04:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
general um
 
04:48:27.948 --> 04:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
agency you know you've got your staff
 
04:48:32.230 --> 04:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
Personnel 78,000 and your benefits 400
 
04:48:35.230 --> 04:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
is it the same cons the same situation
 
04:48:36.750 --> 04:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you
 
04:48:40.868 --> 04:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
okay as you know class 10 positions are
 
04:48:43.708 --> 04:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
budgeted on that position as well as
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
their benefit package at the time that
 
04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
the budget is
 
04:48:51.310 --> 04:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
created and if you look at 24 we used a
 
04:48:54.910 --> 04:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
lot less than what it looks like we had
 
04:48:57.310 --> 04:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
a couple of vacancies
 
04:49:00.990 --> 04:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
truthfully at the bottom of page 755 We
 
04:49:01.000 --> 04:49:03.190 align:start position:0%
truthfully at the bottom of page 755 We
Begin

04:49:03.190 --> 04:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
Begin
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
hatcheries hatcheries
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure is critically
 
04:49:17.708 --> 04:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:19.830 --> 04:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
years current
 
04:49:22.270 --> 04:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
expenses we didn't even budget as much
 
04:49:26.030 --> 04:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
as we spent in fiscal year 24 we did go
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
up a little bit on heat electricity and
 
04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
water and we did increase our
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
contractual maintenance a little bit to
 
04:49:37.708 --> 04:49:37.718 align:start position:0%
help alleviate some of those
 
04:49:37.718 --> 04:49:39.310 align:start position:0%
help alleviate some of those
infrastructure

04:49:39.310 --> 04:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
issues you said underfunded is that did
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
I hear that corre it is underfunded so
 
04:49:45.030 --> 04:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
too few people because it's mostly
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
people right no there's there's too
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
little money to handle the critical
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needs of the Hatchery
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
system so where is
 
04:49:58.830 --> 04:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
that where's that where's that dollar
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
amount represented in the budget the
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that we have in here now
 
04:50:06.670 --> 04:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
is under class 48 contractual
 
04:50:08.590 --> 04:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance buildings and grounds which
 
04:50:13.510 --> 04:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
we did increase by 150 ,000 in each
 
04:50:17.230 --> 04:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
year okay fair enough um so you you had
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
10 people right roughly is that no we
 
04:50:21.548 --> 04:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
have 30 people in 30 people so right
 
04:50:24.030 --> 04:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
right 30 people so a lot of people a lot
 
04:50:26.910 --> 04:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
of money
 
04:50:29.070 --> 04:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
um and yet you say it's underfunded
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
because you need more money for the
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance the infrastructure is
 
04:50:35.350 --> 04:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
underfunded yes so what are the people
 
04:50:36.548 --> 04:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
the people must be doing something then
 
04:50:38.750 --> 04:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
other than just that obviously oh yeah
 
04:50:40.110 --> 04:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
they're running our hatcheries they're
 
04:50:42.310 --> 04:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
taking care of the fish they okay so
 
04:50:44.590 --> 04:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
it's a maintenance that's underfunded by
 
04:50:47.310 --> 04:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
how much the maintenance of the
 
04:50:50.590 --> 04:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
buildings how how
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
underfunded that well yeah I mean in the
 
04:50:55.948 --> 04:50:55.958 align:start position:0%
capital budget alone we have like $6
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
Million worth of infrastructure that's
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
needed um from the previous that's what
 
04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
we're working on right now from the
 
04:51:06.070 --> 04:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
previous B and so now um this new
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
capital budget there's not much listed
 
04:51:08.910 --> 04:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
in there because we have projects that
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
are ongoing right now but the next go
 
04:51:13.270 --> 04:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
around I anticipate we're going to see
 
04:51:16.510 --> 04:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
another several million large probably a
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
large ask another five or six million so
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
you did get six million in the current
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
we where we are now for yes Cent yes
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and that's what we're working
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
through right now representative ended
 
04:51:29.628 --> 04:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
up to be four and a half but we had a
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
six and a half ask we ended up with four
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
and a half okay chairman wer how many
 
04:51:36.910 --> 04:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
fish are we producing a
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
year I don't have the answer for that
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
That I Used to Know It wait a minute I
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
knew it for a moment we don't count fish
 
04:51:45.948 --> 04:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
we count pounds it was pounds yeah I
 
04:51:47.190 --> 04:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
trying to remember I don't have it with
 
04:51:49.470 --> 04:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
me but it often seems to me as I look at
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
all the capital budget on this and all
 
04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
the repairs and all the complaints that
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
this is not economical I mean this
 
04:51:57.788 --> 04:51:57.798 align:start position:0%
should be paid for by the fishing
 
04:51:59.948 --> 04:51:59.958 align:start position:0%
licenses right I don't think we bring in
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
license we don't raise deer and yet
 
04:52:07.708 --> 04:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
people go out and pay for a hunting
 
04:52:10.030 --> 04:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
license to shoot deer I'm sure that that
 
04:52:12.070 --> 04:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
if we didn't raise fish that still be
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
fish well it's a different species of
 
04:52:16.948 --> 04:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
fish and what we're working on obviously
 
04:52:20.230 --> 04:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
is on the fish Inland Fisheries habitat
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
feed is working on improving the habitat
 
04:52:24.990 --> 04:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
so that they're sustaining the fish that
 
04:52:27.628 --> 04:52:27.638 align:start position:0%
we're actually raising right so that
 
04:52:31.750 --> 04:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
then we can maybe decline on our
 
04:52:35.110 --> 04:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
production and allow for natural native
 
04:52:39.990 --> 04:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
fish and with that being said if we used
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
all of our fishing license revenue on
 
04:52:47.708 --> 04:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
fish we wouldn't have a law enforcement
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
division we wouldn't have a business
 
04:52:52.150 --> 04:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
division that's because business and law
 
04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement don't create licenses no and
 
04:52:56.230 --> 04:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that if we didn't have all
 
04:52:58.150 --> 04:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
these fish hatcheries we'd still sell
 
04:52:58.160 --> 04:52:59.230 align:start position:0%
these fish hatcheries we'd still sell
fishing

04:52:59.230 --> 04:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
04:53:02.990 --> 04:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
licenses not if there's no fish to catch
 
04:53:06.350 --> 04:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
what are we paying for fish per fish per
 
04:53:09.230 --> 04:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
fish or per pound yeah I I'll have to
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
get that for you sir I'm sorry sorry I
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
don't have that number
 
04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
just often thought as as I look at all
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
the capital budget on all this and all
 
04:53:18.670 --> 04:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
the complaints and all the repairs and
 
04:53:20.910 --> 04:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
all the all the money that goes into
 
04:53:22.628 --> 04:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
these fish hatcheries through the years
 
04:53:25.310 --> 04:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
that well to put it in perspective sir
 
04:53:30.788 --> 04:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
our fish hatcheries are very very
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
old a couple of them are like a hundred
 
04:53:37.830 --> 04:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
years old our newest one is 50 55 years
 
04:53:41.788 --> 04:53:41.798 align:start position:0%
old and we deferred Main M on these
 
04:53:46.070 --> 04:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
facilities for years because of budget
 
04:53:49.310 --> 04:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
constraints about 30 years ago I called
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
up to get to buy fish to put in a
 
04:53:55.430 --> 04:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
pond it cost me
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
$200 for 100
 
04:53:58.320 --> 04:54:00.030 align:start position:0%
$200 for 100
fish

04:54:00.030 --> 04:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
fish
 
04:54:03.070 --> 04:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
and it was from a private
 
04:54:05.628 --> 04:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
contractor not from fishing
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
game most of them died anyway but we
 
04:54:13.788 --> 04:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
that worked for the Hatchery okay but he
 
04:54:20.788 --> 04:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
sold them to me privately which made me
 
04:54:24.470 --> 04:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
suspicious would make me suspicious too
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
thank you the the fact of the matter is
 
04:54:31.390 --> 04:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
is that we are in a state where um much
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
of our facilities have been neglected
 
04:54:35.430 --> 04:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
when you know the two things that always
 
04:54:37.948 --> 04:54:37.958 align:start position:0%
got sort of pushed aside were Outreach
 
04:54:41.310 --> 04:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
and education and uh
 
04:54:43.230 --> 04:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
facilities maintenance of facilities
 
04:54:44.670 --> 04:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
Whenever there was a budget cut those
 
04:54:46.628 --> 04:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
are the two areas that got cut the the
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
most and so now we're trying to make up
 
04:54:51.708 --> 04:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
for that deficit with this new um
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
Innovative Hatchery coming online that's
 
04:54:57.310 --> 04:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
going to create a different avenue for
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
us a different perspective for us and
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
we'll start hopefully to transition all
 
04:55:04.430 --> 04:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
the other hatcheries to more current
 
04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
methods and you may find that we aren't
 
04:55:08.110 --> 04:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
going to have as many hatcheries we may
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
be able to produce as many fish in fewer
 
04:55:12.628 --> 04:55:12.638 align:start position:0%
hatcheries with a less overhead in the
 
04:55:16.350 --> 04:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
long term I hope so
 
04:55:19.150 --> 04:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
too that the Hatchery the Innovative
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hatchery yeah it right now our
 
04:55:23.590 --> 04:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
hatcheries are flowthrough systems the
 
04:55:26.110 --> 04:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
water yes yes so you're familiar it goes
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
right through the new Hatchery is going
 
04:55:30.830 --> 04:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
to allow us to recycle water it's going
 
04:55:33.350 --> 04:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
to allow us to manage the contaminant
 
04:55:35.350 --> 04:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
levels it's going to be very
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art Innovative um it's
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
actually probably going to be the
 
04:55:43.470 --> 04:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
pilot project for the United States to
 
04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
is well it's a public resource
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
sir but certainly we will be I'm sure
 
04:55:56.070 --> 04:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
giving tours about the the new Hatchery
 
04:55:57.470 --> 04:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
once it's
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
online it's New Hampton Newton we just
 
04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
started construction they have just
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
taken down the runways from the former
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
Hatchery we're in the process of uh the
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
construction right now anticipated
 
04:56:12.788 --> 04:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
October of 26 that we should be opening
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
the doors and yeah it's very
 
04:56:19.310 --> 04:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
exciting but to your point I think we we
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
will get there you might have to just
 
04:56:26.510 --> 04:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
years okay ala sorry so our next account
 
04:56:32.350 --> 04:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
on page
 
04:56:35.788 --> 04:56:35.798 align:start position:0%
757 is the Fisheries habitat management
 
04:56:38.510 --> 04:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
which is a dedicated account funded with
 
04:56:41.548 --> 04:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
that $1 Fisheries habitat fee and
 
04:56:44.548 --> 04:56:44.558 align:start position:0%
federal funds we have two full-time
 
04:56:47.948 --> 04:56:47.958 align:start position:0%
people who work under this account that
 
04:56:50.548 --> 04:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
are dedicated to Fisheries
 
04:56:53.788 --> 04:56:53.798 align:start position:0%
habitat the next account down way at the
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 757 broodstock Atlantic
 
04:56:58.990 --> 04:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
salmon has gone
 
04:57:02.030 --> 04:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
away because we stopped selling that
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
salmon permit many years
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
ago so as you can see it has been zeroed
 
04:57:14.830 --> 04:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
out we in ra years ago yep but this goes
 
04:57:17.230 --> 04:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
to your point sir like was this cost
 
04:57:19.230 --> 04:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
effective and it wasn't and so that's
 
04:57:21.310 --> 04:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
why we no longer do this correct and we
 
04:57:24.548 --> 04:57:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:28.150 --> 04:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
permit sale of fish
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
food does anyone know it's a quiz anyone
 
04:57:34.350 --> 04:57:34.360 align:start position:0%
know where the revenue comes from to
 
04:57:40.630 --> 04:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:40.640 --> 04:57:44.868 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:57:47.230 --> 04:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
it comes from the vending machines at
 
04:57:50.788 --> 04:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
our hatcheries that you put a quarter in
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
and you can get a handful of pellets to
 
04:57:55.788 --> 04:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
feed the fish so this account has been
 
04:57:58.310 --> 04:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
around for many many many years and it's
 
04:58:01.628 --> 04:58:01.638 align:start position:0%
a dedicated account and in statute the
 
04:58:04.750 --> 04:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
funds can only be used for purchasing
 
04:58:07.868 --> 04:58:07.878 align:start position:0%
equipment at our
 
04:58:12.310 --> 04:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:14.510 --> 04:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
with all due respect for whoever the
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
legislators were at the time a dedicated
 
04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
fund for a few thousand a year seems to
 
04:58:24.270 --> 04:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
be a u desperate candidate for a cutting
 
04:58:26.270 --> 04:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
floor so
 
04:58:30.430 --> 04:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
um I honest to God it's 5,000 a year
 
04:58:32.270 --> 04:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
just the overhead of keeping track of
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
the darn thing is probably bigger than
 
04:58:49.628 --> 04:58:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:52.750 --> 04:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
on the top of page 759 is Fish
 
04:58:55.230 --> 04:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
Conservation this was a new uh
 
04:58:58.150 --> 04:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that was implemented
 
04:58:59.948 --> 04:58:59.958 align:start position:0%
with this current banial budget that
 
04:59:02.190 --> 04:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
we're in as you can see in fiscal year
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
expenditures it was kind of developed
 
04:59:13.990 --> 04:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
to take the place of the salmon account
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
but it's to be
 
04:59:20.070 --> 04:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
self-funded so until we get some Revenue
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
in there we're not going to incur any
 
04:59:24.030 --> 04:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures what's it
 
04:59:26.708 --> 04:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
for if you had
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue we were the we were anticipating
 
04:59:32.910 --> 04:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
hiring a part-time person at in under
 
04:59:32.920 --> 04:59:34.470 align:start position:0%
hiring a part-time person at in under
class

04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
class
 
04:59:37.470 --> 04:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
50 to work in the Inland Fisheries
 
04:59:40.990 --> 04:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
division on Fish Conservation
 
04:59:43.788 --> 04:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
I can't speak any more to it than that
 
04:59:45.510 --> 04:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
it would just it would further help us
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
with like uh fish habitat improvements
 
04:59:50.430 --> 04:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
and things like that but it was designed
 
04:59:50.440 --> 04:59:52.270 align:start position:0%
and things like that but it was designed
to

04:59:52.270 --> 04:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:59:56.030 --> 04:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
be um with donations so there were no
 
04:59:58.910 --> 04:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures in 24 because we didn't get
 
05:00:01.070 --> 05:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
any donations
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
in so that wraps up the Inland Fisheries
 
05:00:10.110 --> 05:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
division so on the top of page 760 We
 
05:00:12.390 --> 05:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
Begin law enforcement and the first
 
05:00:15.270 --> 05:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
accounting unit is ohrv education
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
training and
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement we have seven full-time
 
05:00:23.190 --> 05:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
staff within this accounting unit and as
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
you look at class 049 transfers to other
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
agencies that's 6.5 million those are
 
05:00:33.190 --> 05:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
the funds that are transferred to
 
05:00:36.390 --> 05:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
dncr based on registration sold that's
 
05:00:45.628 --> 05:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
our next account in law enforcement on
 
05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
761 is the Deputy Co program which they
 
05:00:55.510 --> 05:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
have moved away from having a deputy Co
 
05:00:57.628 --> 05:00:57.638 align:start position:0%
program although the colonel did want to
 
05:00:59.990 --> 05:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
continue funding it in the next
 
05:01:02.910 --> 05:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
bium I apologize just a quick question
 
05:01:06.190 --> 05:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
on the previous $6.5 million I
 
05:01:11.788 --> 05:01:11.798 align:start position:0%
understand why okay is there any way um
 
05:01:15.390 --> 05:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
you could provide thoughts on what uh
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding existing legislation do
 
05:01:20.190 --> 05:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
they really need 6.5 million to do what
 
05:01:22.510 --> 05:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
they are doing I cannot speak to another
 
05:01:26.270 --> 05:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
agency's cost sir a I can't sorry fully
 
05:01:29.310 --> 05:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
understood I appreciate it it's it's not
 
05:01:36.548 --> 05:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.190 --> 05:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
okay so then going down to 1186
 
05:01:45.990 --> 05:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:49.548 --> 05:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
self-funded and right now um we don't
 
05:01:53.430 --> 05:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:58.110 --> 05:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
funds then we go to representative
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
wier's favorite account on page 762
 
05:02:08.350 --> 05:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
rescue there are no full-time staff in
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
search and rescue obviously it's
 
05:02:20.110 --> 05:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:22.990 --> 05:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
pay then all the way down at the bottom
 
05:02:27.070 --> 05:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
of 763 we have conservation law
 
05:02:29.548 --> 05:02:29.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement which is where the general
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
funds have historically been since
 
05:02:35.788 --> 05:02:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:43.320 --> 05:02:45.548 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

05:02:45.548 --> 05:02:45.558 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
chair yeah represent P Phillips my
 
05:02:49.628 --> 05:02:49.638 align:start position:0%
apologies to everyone here I have an
 
05:02:51.150 --> 05:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
appointment I have to run to so I'll be
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
watching the video of the rest of this
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
from home tonight thank you than
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:04.788 --> 05:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
okay continue so if there are no
 
05:03:06.628 --> 05:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
questions on law enforcement that
 
05:03:11.230 --> 05:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
completes the law enforcement division
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
and brings us to marine fisheries
 
05:03:18.390 --> 05:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
management nothing extraordinary no
 
05:03:20.590 --> 05:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
major changes in marine fisheries
 
05:03:25.510 --> 05:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:28.990 --> 05:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
765 we can turn to page
 
05:03:32.910 --> 05:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
766 and at the bottom of such is the
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
reserve program affectionately known as
 
05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
gibner the Great Bay National estuary in
 
05:03:40.200 --> 05:03:44.310 align:start position:0%
gibner the Great Bay National estuary in
research

05:03:44.310 --> 05:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:51.270 --> 05:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
either people come to that want to have
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
their own little Oyster Bed on there
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
outside the Waterfront lot in Great Bay
 
05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
no no that's not that's not us okay this
 
05:04:04.910 --> 05:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
is separate thought I thought you
 
05:04:04.920 --> 05:04:06.070 align:start position:0%
is separate thought I thought you
licensed

05:04:06.070 --> 05:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
05:04:10.628 --> 05:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
them we licensed them out of Region
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
Three the Region Three office yes but
 
05:04:16.350 --> 05:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
yes we but it's not in the reserve if I
 
05:04:18.150 --> 05:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
may ask what is it because I don't know
 
05:04:20.990 --> 05:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
what it is the program the gibner you
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
said gibner it's it's an estrian it's
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
like a you know what a wild life uh
 
05:04:29.708 --> 05:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
Reserve is yes a refuge this a similar
 
05:04:31.868 --> 05:04:31.878 align:start position:0%
approach um they do a lot of Outreach
 
05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
and education there they've do a lot of
 
05:04:36.590 --> 05:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
research there and actually we're in the
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
process of getting it um worldwide recog
 
05:04:43.230 --> 05:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
ized because of its abilities and its
 
05:04:46.350 --> 05:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
uniqueness to the salt marsh
 
05:04:49.390 --> 05:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
area you're welcome it is primarily
 
05:04:52.670 --> 05:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
federally funded about 70% and those are
 
05:04:52.680 --> 05:04:58.470 align:start position:0%
federally funded about 70% and those are

05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
grants next we have salt marsh
 
05:05:04.670 --> 05:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
monitoring and restoration program at
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page 767 it's a relatively
 
05:05:10.350 --> 05:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
new program
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact we did not even have
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
a budget for 25 because we brought the
 
05:05:20.350 --> 05:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
funds in in fiscal year 24 through a
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
either a GNC or perhaps a GNC fiscal it
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
I think it was just GNC I don't think it
 
05:05:27.830 --> 05:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
met the threshold for fiscal committee
 
05:05:31.110 --> 05:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
and then represent muray thank you um
 
05:05:33.750 --> 05:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I noticed the 2025 all the zeros
 
05:05:35.548 --> 05:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering is this an an ongoing
 
05:05:38.430 --> 05:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a program or um since there was
 
05:05:40.510 --> 05:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
that Gap is this related to particular
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
storm damage um that would be sort of a
 
05:05:45.310 --> 05:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
one-time restoration as opposed to
 
05:05:48.350 --> 05:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
ongoing projects it's ongoing projects
 
05:05:50.628 --> 05:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
it is not related to storm damage thank
 
05:05:53.150 --> 05:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:55.948 --> 05:05:55.958 align:start position:0%
welcome and as you can see it is
 
05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
federally funded no fish and game funds
 
05:06:06.750 --> 05:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:10.150 --> 05:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
funds next on The Hit List here on page
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
768 is the coastal cleanup fund which is
 
05:06:15.948 --> 05:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
also a brand new
 
05:06:19.628 --> 05:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
fund and these funds are actually
 
05:06:23.868 --> 05:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
derived from a $15 fee on derelict
 
05:06:23.878 --> 05:06:26.510 align:start position:0%
derived from a $15 fee on derelict
fishing

05:06:26.510 --> 05:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:30.190 --> 05:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
gear you may remember that going through
 
05:06:30.200 --> 05:06:33.990 align:start position:0%
gear you may remember that going through
the

05:06:33.990 --> 05:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:37.390 --> 05:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
legislature derel fishing gear yes how
 
05:06:41.670 --> 05:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:44.548 --> 05:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
well it yeah it depends on the type of
 
05:06:46.430 --> 05:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
gear some of the gear has to be labeled
 
05:06:50.110 --> 05:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:54.548 --> 05:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
Fisher on the top of page 769 we have
 
05:06:59.390 --> 05:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
the gibner Pack 2020 which is also
 
05:07:01.670 --> 05:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
affectionately known as The Glen Cove
 
05:07:03.788 --> 05:07:03.798 align:start position:0%
project I don't know if any of you have
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to go out there and
 
05:07:10.030 --> 05:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
view this project we
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
inherited if you will a very large
 
05:07:15.310 --> 05:07:15.320 align:start position:0%
parcel of land out on Great
 
05:07:21.150 --> 05:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
Bay and received several at least three
 
05:07:25.868 --> 05:07:25.878 align:start position:0%
very large federal grants to totally
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
redo and renovate this
 
05:07:32.350 --> 05:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
property yes and we have removed some
 
05:07:34.990 --> 05:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
we're renovating some it's a very large
 
05:07:35.000 --> 05:07:36.430 align:start position:0%
we're renovating some it's a very large
beautiful

05:07:36.430 --> 05:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
beautiful
 
05:07:39.150 --> 05:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
project so as you can see there are no
 
05:07:41.788 --> 05:07:41.798 align:start position:0%
fun funds in fiscal year 27 because it
 
05:07:45.030 --> 05:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
is scheduled to be
 
05:07:48.670 --> 05:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
completed and that completes the marine
 
05:07:48.680 --> 05:07:49.948 align:start position:0%
completed and that completes the marine
fisheries

05:07:49.948 --> 05:07:49.958 align:start position:0%
fisheries
 
05:07:52.830 --> 05:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
division we have one division left and
 
05:07:55.830 --> 05:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
that is facilities and lands there are
 
05:07:58.270 --> 05:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
only two accounting units the first of
 
05:08:01.590 --> 05:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
which is 2117 on the top of page
 
05:08:04.150 --> 05:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
770 this is the public boat access
 
05:08:10.390 --> 05:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:12.628 --> 05:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
no large increases
 
05:08:15.270 --> 05:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
here with the exception of I guess a
 
05:08:18.590 --> 05:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
little bit in our consultant line and
 
05:08:24.110 --> 05:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:28.830 --> 05:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
engineer and that is 100% funded with um
 
05:08:32.310 --> 05:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds which is the $5 boat
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
registration fee that comes to us
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
directly from the Department of Safety
 
05:08:39.030 --> 05:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
and federal funds and then the last
 
05:08:43.150 --> 05:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
account unit is on page 771 what we call
 
05:08:45.270 --> 05:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
facility maintenance we have six
 
05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
full-time staff here they do various
 
05:08:51.868 --> 05:08:51.878 align:start position:0%
construction and maintenance of our
 
05:08:54.628 --> 05:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
facilities on not only on Hazen drive
 
05:08:56.628 --> 05:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
but they also go around to our Regional
 
05:08:57.910 --> 05:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
Offices and
 
05:09:01.590 --> 05:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
hatcheries we also pay the majority of
 
05:09:05.310 --> 05:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
our class 23 heat electricity and water
 
05:09:07.590 --> 05:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
for our not only our headquarters but
 
05:09:12.868 --> 05:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think there's
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
anything odd there this is mostly
 
05:09:23.350 --> 05:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
fishing game funded very little federal
 
05:09:26.030 --> 05:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
funds and the only other two accounts
 
05:09:28.190 --> 05:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
are unemployment
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
compensation which we've budgeted at a
 
05:09:33.948 --> 05:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
whopping $50 in our workers compensation
 
05:09:36.150 --> 05:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
we have to pay directly for workers comp
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
because we are a self-funded agency so
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
we base we are
 
05:09:44.670 --> 05:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:47.110 --> 05:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
incurred and that brings us to the end
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
of our
 
05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
budget represent Murray yeah two
 
05:09:54.548 --> 05:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
questions I missed something back on 765
 
05:09:56.310 --> 05:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
um the general fund was zeroed out where
 
05:10:00.270 --> 05:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
is that where that money hold on
 
05:10:03.230 --> 05:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
yep it's it's part of
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
765 under law enforcement so that's law
 
05:10:07.830 --> 05:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement those are the general funds
 
05:10:09.628 --> 05:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
that were taken from our bu budget
 
05:10:12.310 --> 05:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
during the governor's phase and so this
 
05:10:13.948 --> 05:10:13.958 align:start position:0%
she zeroed those out she zeroed those
 
05:10:16.190 --> 05:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
out so this is a big and the incre and
 
05:10:18.788 --> 05:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
all Appropriations remain the same yeah
 
05:10:21.510 --> 05:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
so as you can see fishing game funds
 
05:10:26.030 --> 05:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
went from 3.9 actual to four and a half
 
05:10:31.230 --> 05:10:31.240 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 25 to 6.2 and
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
6.3 it's under law enforcement it's so
 
05:10:35.230 --> 05:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
that was one of the what account number
 
05:10:43.430 --> 05:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the other sorry the other question
 
05:10:47.948 --> 05:10:47.958 align:start position:0%
um or is there anything else to say
 
05:10:49.590 --> 05:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
about the governor's cut other than you
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
probably need the money back so it will
 
05:10:53.708 --> 05:10:53.718 align:start position:0%
it will impact us for certain
 
05:10:55.030 --> 05:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
significant what would be the impact
 
05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
since we're here well we so for the
 
05:10:59.150 --> 05:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
longest time we weren't getting General
 
05:11:00.510 --> 05:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
funds we finally started getting General
 
05:11:02.590 --> 05:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
funds we have uh five vacancies
 
05:11:05.590 --> 05:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
currently for law enforcement if we
 
05:11:08.350 --> 05:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
aren't able to get this funding we will
 
05:11:10.548 --> 05:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
not be able to those positions which are
 
05:11:14.150 --> 05:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
desperately needed um the other piece is
 
05:11:15.868 --> 05:11:15.878 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before we have 38 field
 
05:11:18.350 --> 05:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
officers and four uh serving an
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
administrative um with 38 across the
 
05:11:24.670 --> 05:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
state our officers are often working
 
05:11:26.910 --> 05:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
many many days straight and when you
 
05:11:28.830 --> 05:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
have all the rescues and the events that
 
05:11:30.670 --> 05:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
occur on the weekends you know they're
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
coming off a mountain one day and then
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
the next day they're called in because
 
05:11:36.510 --> 05:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
of uh something else has happened over
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
time it increases our po
 
05:11:41.470 --> 05:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
it increases our potential for overtime
 
05:11:43.110 --> 05:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
it increases our potential for workman's
 
05:11:44.910 --> 05:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
comp because people get injured when
 
05:11:46.430 --> 05:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
they don't have time to rest things like
 
05:11:49.150 --> 05:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
that it's it's a domino effect I'll be
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:55.628 --> 05:11:55.638 align:start position:0%
effect thank you you're welcome the
 
05:11:56.830 --> 05:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
other thing even though it wasn't
 
05:12:04.990 --> 05:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:08.190 --> 05:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
in part two or what we're considering
 
05:12:11.310 --> 05:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
hb2 around around the um permitting uh
 
05:12:12.910 --> 05:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's sense of trying to
 
05:12:14.350 --> 05:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
streamline permitting and making it
 
05:12:18.628 --> 05:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
easier to do that um it does affect you
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
this is particular I think how it
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
affects you with the threatened and
 
05:12:23.270 --> 05:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
endangered species
 
05:12:26.590 --> 05:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
compensatory mitigation fund um I guess
 
05:12:27.990 --> 05:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
assuming if someone's putting in a
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
permit which is going to have an
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
environmental effect um this all kicks
 
05:12:36.670 --> 05:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
in how does what she's proposing here
 
05:12:38.430 --> 05:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
how will it impact you and your ability
 
05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
to um get this work done so what she's
 
05:12:45.708 --> 05:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
proposed definitely has a significant
 
05:12:49.590 --> 05:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
impact on us um to be upfront we are
 
05:12:51.990 --> 05:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
100% behind the governor's initiative
 
05:12:54.430 --> 05:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
and and desire for efficiency government
 
05:12:57.430 --> 05:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
efficiency and One-Stop shopping for the
 
05:12:59.070 --> 05:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
applicants things like that whatever we
 
05:13:03.030 --> 05:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
can do to improve that however in our
 
05:13:05.628 --> 05:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
agency environmental review is not
 
05:13:08.310 --> 05:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
limited to aot permits or permits that
 
05:13:11.030 --> 05:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
go just through Dees we have other
 
05:13:13.230 --> 05:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
environmental reviews that we conduct
 
05:13:15.990 --> 05:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
for other entities including reviews for
 
05:13:18.470 --> 05:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
NEPA and federal organizations for
 
05:13:20.110 --> 05:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that are trying to get
 
05:13:23.350 --> 05:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
federal grants so if all four of those
 
05:13:25.830 --> 05:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
positions are removed from our agency we
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
will have no capacity or very limited I
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
won't say no limited capacity to do that
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
work um we are working with the other
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
agencies involved and discussing an
 
05:13:39.150 --> 05:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
alternative approach um what would be
 
05:13:41.788 --> 05:13:41.798 align:start position:0%
the ideal is you know if if this is to
 
05:13:44.788 --> 05:13:44.798 align:start position:0%
move forward that we at least retain at
 
05:13:47.230 --> 05:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
the minimum one perhaps two of those
 
05:13:49.110 --> 05:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
positions to maintain our own
 
05:13:52.390 --> 05:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
consistency and our own um uh
 
05:13:56.310 --> 05:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
requirements for uh environmental review
 
05:13:58.350 --> 05:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
there is of course some concern about
 
05:14:00.510 --> 05:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
the redundancy across two agencies
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's concern about the uh the
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
increase in in uh funding to create this
 
05:14:10.708 --> 05:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
group in Dees there are other uh excuse
 
05:14:13.310 --> 05:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
me other concerns that have been raised
 
05:14:15.110 --> 05:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless what we're going to do
 
05:14:17.150 --> 05:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
is you know wherever it lands we're
 
05:14:18.350 --> 05:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
going to make it work we're going to
 
05:14:20.868 --> 05:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
make it be effective I do have concerns
 
05:14:23.830 --> 05:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
about our agency being completely
 
05:14:26.430 --> 05:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
stripped of the ability to do our jobs
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
um you know I want to support the
 
05:14:29.590 --> 05:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
governor but I also have an agency that
 
05:14:31.548 --> 05:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
I need to make sure we're meeting our
 
05:14:34.750 --> 05:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
mandates uh I do have concerns that we
 
05:14:37.430 --> 05:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
we work together with Dees and dancer
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
and ensure that we're minimizing in any
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
potential increase in litigations
 
05:14:44.030 --> 05:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
because of the review process the last
 
05:14:45.510 --> 05:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
thing we need is for New Hampshire to
 
05:14:47.548 --> 05:14:47.558 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden be in the spotlight for
 
05:14:49.628 --> 05:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
more litigation so there are there's a
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
lot of work that needs to go into this
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not saying it's impossible we I'm
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
just saying we need to be smart about
 
05:14:58.548 --> 05:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
how we approach it and uh yes I it does
 
05:15:01.310 --> 05:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
impact us significantly so if I
 
05:15:02.788 --> 05:15:02.798 align:start position:0%
understand correctly just make sure that
 
05:15:04.910 --> 05:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
I do if this went through the way it is
 
05:15:07.310 --> 05:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
written you would lose the positions you
 
05:15:10.470 --> 05:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
have they would all go into this other
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
yes stream and that would mean that
 
05:15:15.830 --> 05:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
reviews that you are supposed to do that
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're perhaps required to do would not
 
05:15:20.030 --> 05:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
get done or do you think they would get
 
05:15:21.270 --> 05:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
done over here they just wouldn't get
 
05:15:23.070 --> 05:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
done I don't they would they would not
 
05:15:26.270 --> 05:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
get would not get done as far as I know
 
05:15:28.150 --> 05:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
I mean we would obviously we're not
 
05:15:29.390 --> 05:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
going to try to get to that point we're
 
05:15:31.270 --> 05:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
going to work through some way that this
 
05:15:36.070 --> 05:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
stuff is addressed but yes thank
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
you R of papovich thank you Mr chair
 
05:15:44.470 --> 05:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
um last fall during the revenue uh
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee we were talking about the uh
 
05:15:49.070 --> 05:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
direct and indirect cost for search and
 
05:15:51.510 --> 05:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
rescue if you remember the department
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
was stating that um they don't you know
 
05:15:58.350 --> 05:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
they don't get enough uh funds and that
 
05:16:00.750 --> 05:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
is a cost imposed on them we went
 
05:16:02.510 --> 05:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
through the whole report submitted to
 
05:16:04.510 --> 05:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee which seem to show
 
05:16:06.670 --> 05:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
that the hike Safeguard and other
 
05:16:08.990 --> 05:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
revenues seem to properly reimburse the
 
05:16:11.670 --> 05:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
department and then I was told that you
 
05:16:13.708 --> 05:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
know there are a bunch of indirect costs
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
stuff like regular pay for the officers
 
05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
involved that are not reported to fiscal
 
05:16:20.030 --> 05:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I did ask you guys at the time if
 
05:16:21.868 --> 05:16:21.878 align:start position:0%
there is any way you could start
 
05:16:24.910 --> 05:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
breaking down that uh internal data so
 
05:16:26.868 --> 05:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
that we can get a better understanding
 
05:16:28.750 --> 05:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
of what the true cost of search and
 
05:16:31.150 --> 05:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
rescue is to fish and game I just wanted
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
to see if you had any update on anything
 
05:16:34.830 --> 05:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
that was done any anywhere you are on
 
05:16:34.840 --> 05:16:35.540 align:start position:0%
that was done any anywhere you are on
that

05:16:35.540 --> 05:16:35.550 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:16:35.550 --> 05:16:37.030 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

05:16:37.030 --> 05:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:16:39.350 --> 05:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
discussion do you have anything for
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
I do not so yes I I did request that and
 
05:16:44.350 --> 05:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
as far as I know that report is being
 
05:16:46.110 --> 05:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
generated for me at this time but I did
 
05:16:48.270 --> 05:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
not have it available to bring today it
 
05:16:49.868 --> 05:16:49.878 align:start position:0%
would be appre obviously I would
 
05:16:51.670 --> 05:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate an update whenever you guys
 
05:16:54.070 --> 05:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
have it it's an issue that we need to
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
continue working on to make sure
 
05:16:57.470 --> 05:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
everything is properly accounted for
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you fully understand yes sir and I
 
05:17:02.708 --> 05:17:02.718 align:start position:0%
would like to add if there is another
 
05:17:05.110 --> 05:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
format that you would like to work with
 
05:17:08.990 --> 05:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
me on for presenting the search and rest
 
05:17:11.390 --> 05:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
your report I'm more than willing to
 
05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
work through Mickey to design a
 
05:17:13.760 --> 05:17:14.910 align:start position:0%
work through Mickey to design a
different

05:17:14.910 --> 05:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:17:17.830 --> 05:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
format thank you I I would be happy to
 
05:17:20.030 --> 05:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
help in any way obviously if we're
 
05:17:21.788 --> 05:17:21.798 align:start position:0%
talking about a meaningful involvement I
 
05:17:23.350 --> 05:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
would suggest waiting until after the
 
05:17:25.628 --> 05:17:25.638 align:start position:0%
budget is done because my I can say the
 
05:17:28.470 --> 05:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
same it is uh it is the last time I've
 
05:17:31.270 --> 05:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
been let's see I I missed three days
 
05:17:32.868 --> 05:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
last week and that was the first time
 
05:17:35.350 --> 05:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
this year I wasn't here 5 days a week so
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
my my time right now is limited but I
 
05:17:38.990 --> 05:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
will be happy to help I just want to
 
05:17:40.910 --> 05:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
point out that we're not looking at as
 
05:17:43.150 --> 05:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
much as a format as where we are looking
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
at including the full range of costs
 
05:17:47.750 --> 05:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
that you guys are incurring right now
 
05:17:51.030 --> 05:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
you are reporting on a partial range of
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
costs and some costs you just absorb
 
05:17:55.350 --> 05:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
without reporting them to fiscal and I'm
 
05:17:59.470 --> 05:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
trying to help you guys better show
 
05:18:01.230 --> 05:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal what you're really dealing with
 
05:18:03.470 --> 05:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
so you we can create the appropriate
 
05:18:05.430 --> 05:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
funding and you
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
know resources that you need to perform
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
that job so you know if we don't show
 
05:18:13.990 --> 05:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
them what you really are spending on it
 
05:18:15.788 --> 05:18:15.798 align:start position:0%
they don't see a need for reimbursement
 
05:18:17.948 --> 05:18:17.958 align:start position:0%
so I would be happy you know I don't
 
05:18:19.670 --> 05:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
want to volunteer anybody other than
 
05:18:22.470 --> 05:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
myself but I would be happy to you know
 
05:18:24.750 --> 05:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
go through a more you know lowlevel
 
05:18:27.070 --> 05:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
analysis if you feel it would help and
 
05:18:29.948 --> 05:18:29.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know suggest any you know
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
improvements one page report is strictly
 
05:18:34.788 --> 05:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
the accounting unit 2117 and the
 
05:18:36.788 --> 05:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
activity in that accounting unit I would
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
foresee it as being like an addendum
 
05:18:41.390 --> 05:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
more an attachment to that report sure
 
05:18:43.190 --> 05:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
we can definitely go into the weeds if
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
you so choose yeah thank you can I just
 
05:18:47.868 --> 05:18:47.878 align:start position:0%
clarify earlier you were speaking about
 
05:18:51.868 --> 05:18:51.878 align:start position:0%
the governor reducing the funding for
 
05:18:54.990 --> 05:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
was it conservation law enforcement 7887
 
05:18:58.030 --> 05:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay so I see that she took away the
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
general funds y but she increased the
 
05:19:02.948 --> 05:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
fish and game fund yep okay so why did
 
05:19:04.990 --> 05:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
you need to reduce the number of people
 
05:19:06.430 --> 05:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
did I misunderstand what was going on
 
05:19:08.030 --> 05:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
there because she balanced the budget
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:14.110 --> 05:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
so she balanced it but because it's
 
05:19:16.910 --> 05:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
based on lapses you're not going to you
 
05:19:18.510 --> 05:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
release people or not replace people or
 
05:19:22.190 --> 05:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
what we don't know yet we're we're in
 
05:19:24.868 --> 05:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
discussions internally about that okay
 
05:19:26.830 --> 05:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
so this is this is not necessarily
 
05:19:28.548 --> 05:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
something that it's cast in stone you've
 
05:19:30.190 --> 05:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
actually eliminated people and you're
 
05:19:30.830 --> 05:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to get
 
05:19:33.070 --> 05:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
environmental no we have not absolutely
 
05:19:35.788 --> 05:19:35.798 align:start position:0%
eliminated people no we have vacancies
 
05:19:37.548 --> 05:19:37.558 align:start position:0%
that are open right now we're filling
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
one of them the question is whether we
 
05:19:41.310 --> 05:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
continue to fill the rest or not
 
05:19:44.430 --> 05:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
assuming the lapse otherwise if we C if
 
05:19:46.190 --> 05:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
we had that certainty of that general
 
05:19:48.110 --> 05:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
fund we wouldn't even question it we
 
05:19:50.430 --> 05:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
would automatically fulfill those okay
 
05:19:51.628 --> 05:19:51.638 align:start position:0%
so it's not cast in stone that
 
05:19:52.910 --> 05:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
everything you described is going to
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily happen right
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
correct so you know on the fishing game
 
05:20:00.670 --> 05:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
funds where you have the increase to 6.2
 
05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
million um this is her expectation of
 
05:20:05.430 --> 05:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
what you
 
05:20:08.788 --> 05:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
will reach at that level no it's not an
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
expectation all it did was the default
 
05:20:16.030 --> 05:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
of course is the fishing game fund so
 
05:20:19.628 --> 05:20:19.638 align:start position:0%
when you take out a fund the default
 
05:20:23.230 --> 05:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.628 --> 05:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
fund thank you everything else remained
 
05:20:26.638 --> 05:20:41.470 align:start position:0%
fund thank you everything else remained
equal

05:20:41.470 --> 05:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:45.750 --> 05:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
yes which you know um that's it's
 
05:20:48.510 --> 05:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
suitable I mean it makes sense it's okay
 
05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
however it's not uh the way that we
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
prefer to operate uh you know clearly in
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
2000 I think it was 15 we reached that
 
05:20:59.788 --> 05:20:59.798 align:start position:0%
low Point again but again we have so
 
05:21:02.310 --> 05:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
much uh infrastructure and other things
 
05:21:05.548 --> 05:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
that need attention we have it needs and
 
05:21:07.310 --> 05:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
I would much prefer to be able to use
 
05:21:11.030 --> 05:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
some of that those funds to elevate this
 
05:21:13.628 --> 05:21:13.638 align:start position:0%
agency to the current
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
Sentry we have people who cannot even do
 
05:21:18.430 --> 05:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
their time sheets because they don't
 
05:21:20.868 --> 05:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
have access to the internet and our
 
05:21:23.350 --> 05:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
hatcheries and Regional we're working
 
05:21:25.390 --> 05:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
through that right now but it's so it's
 
05:21:27.150 --> 05:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
just a matter of figuring out where we
 
05:21:28.948 --> 05:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
land and then how we what we can
 
05:21:31.670 --> 05:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
accomplish over the next buum so back to
 
05:21:33.190 --> 05:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
the discussion we about earlier please
 
05:21:35.628 --> 05:21:35.638 align:start position:0%
get me the information about yes sir
 
05:21:37.270 --> 05:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
restricted funds where we can increase
 
05:21:38.830 --> 05:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
fees maybe unrestrict funds and so on
 
05:21:40.590 --> 05:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
and so forth because maybe that's a a
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
solution to the concerns that you're
 
05:21:45.310 --> 05:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
raising absolutely
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you again
 
05:21:49.470 --> 05:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
um you you have a substantial amount of
 
05:21:51.390 --> 05:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
federal funds and usually we don't need
 
05:21:53.830 --> 05:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
to look at federal funds you know that's
 
05:21:55.390 --> 05:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
fine we're we're really happy you get
 
05:21:58.390 --> 05:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
that um are you are there any concerns
 
05:22:00.110 --> 05:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
are any Flags coming up around federal
 
05:22:01.990 --> 05:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
funds in terms of funds that are going
 
05:22:04.990 --> 05:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
to be withheld or don't disappear um
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
what are your concerns in that regard uh
 
05:22:09.070 --> 05:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say we're probably middle
 
05:22:10.510 --> 05:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
of the road right now we have some
 
05:22:12.670 --> 05:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
concerns because we did just get
 
05:22:15.150 --> 05:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
notification that one of our funds is on
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
hold and we can no longer charge against
 
05:22:19.788 --> 05:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
it we've already of course with with
 
05:22:22.030 --> 05:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
Federal you get a reimbursement so we've
 
05:22:24.070 --> 05:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
already expended funds that we may have
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
to cover if we can no longer charge to
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
that Grant um at this point that's the
 
05:22:33.350 --> 05:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
only one that we are definitive on there
 
05:22:35.830 --> 05:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
are a couple other grants that have been
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
in discussions I'm not sure where those
 
05:22:42.070 --> 05:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
are going to land um certainly if if
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
federal funds are put to a halt we will
 
05:22:47.110 --> 05:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
we will be struggling at least for the
 
05:22:55.110 --> 05:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:58.110 --> 05:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
half do you know I do not off the top of
 
05:23:00.590 --> 05:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
my head but all of our federal funds
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
which would
 
05:23:08.510 --> 05:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
be Federal is federal PR DJ are um in
 
05:23:08.520 --> 05:23:09.868 align:start position:0%
be Federal is federal PR DJ are um in
annual

05:23:09.868 --> 05:23:09.878 align:start position:0%
annual
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
apportionments and Noah we bring in 8 to
 
05:23:16.270 --> 05:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
11 million a year in federal funds let
 
05:23:18.750 --> 05:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
me see I may actually have it here in
 
05:23:21.470 --> 05:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
one of my papers I might be able to tell
 
05:23:25.868 --> 05:23:25.878 align:start position:0%
you that but um one point I will make is
 
05:23:28.270 --> 05:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
that one encouraging thing that is
 
05:23:31.590 --> 05:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
happening in DC and may affect us in the
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
long term is there's been a movement to
 
05:23:37.350 --> 05:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
consider the ex the excise taxes on
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
online purchases
 
05:23:42.868 --> 05:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
that come from out of country so that if
 
05:23:44.990 --> 05:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
they can get that pass that will help
 
05:23:48.150 --> 05:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
all of us across the nation um the
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
federal grants over the last uh fiscal
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
year I guess was just over was that
 
05:23:56.070 --> 05:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
right just over a million there or five
 
05:23:58.868 --> 05:23:58.878 align:start position:0%
million yeah so over over 10 million
 
05:24:02.670 --> 05:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
over the last fiscal year we did have a
 
05:24:06.270 --> 05:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
reduction of about well let's see total
 
05:24:08.708 --> 05:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
that's 20 about 10% reduction that's
 
05:24:11.430 --> 05:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
just PR and DJ so that does not include
 
05:24:13.750 --> 05:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
the Noah grants yeah I'm sorry I was
 
05:24:21.310 --> 05:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:24.590 --> 05:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely repr d a strange
 
05:24:26.788 --> 05:24:26.798 align:start position:0%
question are we still doing Northwood
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
law and if we are do you get money for
 
05:24:33.310 --> 05:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
that I knew we couldn't get out of this
 
05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
meting without that question so we are
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
looking at um potentially Rec
 
05:24:42.750 --> 05:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
Contracting with the original producers
 
05:24:45.150 --> 05:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
um we'll be bringing that before uh
 
05:24:47.670 --> 05:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
Governor counsel if it moves forward the
 
05:24:49.430 --> 05:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
thing is that uh initially they're
 
05:24:51.270 --> 05:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
they're changing their format they're
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
looking at doing short sort of YouTube
 
05:24:56.868 --> 05:24:56.878 align:start position:0%
clips videos and rather than a TV show
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind um the initial uh
 
05:25:02.270 --> 05:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
proposal would be that there would be no
 
05:25:05.788 --> 05:25:05.798 align:start position:0%
revenue and except for them to sell ads
 
05:25:08.510 --> 05:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
and once they started selling ads um
 
05:25:11.350 --> 05:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
they then may make donations to the
 
05:25:11.360 --> 05:25:12.430 align:start position:0%
they then may make donations to the
Heritage

05:25:12.430 --> 05:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
Heritage
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
Foundation for us as an agency to ask
 
05:25:17.310 --> 05:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
for funding for that it's a little
 
05:25:19.110 --> 05:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
awkward we spoke with the AG's office
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's not really appropriate for us as an
 
05:25:23.670 --> 05:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
agency to do so however if they want to
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
donate to the Heritage Foundation by all
 
05:25:27.230 --> 05:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
means they can and that's how they
 
05:25:29.150 --> 05:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
managed the payments last time as they
 
05:25:31.708 --> 05:25:31.718 align:start position:0%
made donations to the Heritage
 
05:25:34.948 --> 05:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
Foundation we did we do yeah through
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
through grants through grants again that
 
05:25:40.230 --> 05:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
I had spoken of very early in the
 
05:25:43.390 --> 05:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
meeting so more to
 
05:25:47.830 --> 05:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
come any other questions gotta go
 
05:25:50.350 --> 05:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
okay so that's
 
05:25:53.150 --> 05:25:53.160 align:start position:0%

appreciate it can do okay thank you and
 
05:25:58.548 --> 05:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
I guess with that we'll unless anybody
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
