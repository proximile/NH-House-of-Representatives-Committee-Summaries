our power went out last night so i if i

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
winds are pretty bad out here on the

this

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
hopefully it won't affect our executive
 
00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
session when we're all supposed to be
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
seeing each other when we vote but we'll
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
see how this works out um the good news
 
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
is that we have today
 
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
we have tomorrow afternoon and then
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
theoretically we have next week which
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
obviously i would like to try to avoid
 
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
um scheduling it for but but we we do
 
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
have it if
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
the creek rises or the wind blows as it
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
may be okay i will open up the public
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 265
 
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
and we'll hear from representative rung
 
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
who's sitting in for representative
 
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
cushing remembers it wrong it feels like
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
it was about a year ago that we last saw
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
each other getting on an airplane jet
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
blue flight to puerto rico
 
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
actually virgin gorda for you i think
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
and it was virgin it was st john for me
 
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
but uh well it's nice to see you again
 
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll see each other
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
flying together on to a sunny beach
 
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.270 align:start position:0%
flying together on to a sunny beach
somewhere

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much chairman hunt and
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
my esteemed colleagues for the of the
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
commerce committee i'm here um in place
 
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
of representative renee cushing to
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill 265
 
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
it's an important bill
 
00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
because it
 
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
enables residents to have confidence
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
that when they buy bottled drinking
 
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
water in new hampshire that it meets all
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the standards set forth by the state
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
however you've heard all the testimony
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
on this already because this is
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
identical to house bill 335 which has
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
already gone through the public hearing
 
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.950 align:start position:0%
already gone through the public hearing
process

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to recommend that you
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
rule this bill inexpedient to legislate
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that we can move on with our business
 
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
um even though you asked for that we
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
still have to have a question because of
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
the full hearing okay
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for
 
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.950 align:start position:0%

00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
there we go um good morning chairman
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
hunt and members of committee i'm james
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
toner director of government relations
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
for the international bottle water
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
association uh just a couple of weeks
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
ago i was
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
testifying before you on house bill 335
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
and expressed concerns over the proposal
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
due to national uniformity and federal
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
preemption at that time i stated that
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
ibwa was neutral on the bill however
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
given further internal and member review
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
ibawa now opposes legislation for those
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
same reasons
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
we believe that attempts
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
to alter regulations for bottled water
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
testing and reporting requirements are
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
disruptive to national uniformity and
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
therefore are an impediment to
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
just as a quick review epa addresses the
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
national regulation requirements for
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
public and drinking water fda handled
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
these for bottled water while epa allows
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
a more stringent uh contaminant levels
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
fda does not
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is demonstrated based upon state
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
oversight while the state has ultimate
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
oversight on drinking water within their
 
00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.590 align:start position:0%
oversight on drinking water within their
state

00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
they do not have the same oversight for
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
water that is sourced outside of their
 
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.110 align:start position:0%
water that is sourced outside of their
borders

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
borders
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
both epa and fda regulates certain
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
contaminants based upon whether or not
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
they determine
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
there is a threat to human health
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
quite often that might mean not imposing
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
any regulation at all
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
in the comments i provided the committee
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
you can see how the fda addressed a
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
situation like this with regard to
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh based upon ibwa's request
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
to set a national soq for these
 
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.670 align:start position:0%
to set a national soq for these
contaminants

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
although given that if
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
although given that epa has stated they
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
are in the process of planning for
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
rulemaking at this time neither agency
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
has seen an immediate need for sending
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
anything beyond a health advisory
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
should that change no matter what the
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
contaminant if epa and fda agree to set
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
limits ibwa will follow their lead in
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
several cases ibwa already has stricter
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines than those mandated by epa or
 
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.509 align:start position:0%
guidelines than those mandated by epa or
fda

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
fda
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
two items i'd like to address that were
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
presented in the hearing on house bill
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
335 first while not all bottlers are
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
members of ibwa and therefore might not
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
comply with our code of practice for
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
most of our stricter or unique standards
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
that we have set
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
we have done so based upon testing of
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
bottled water we did not set lower limit
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
standards limits or standards on pfas
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
based upon what we were seeing in any
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
one given state but because we know that
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
bottled water manufacturers are not
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
seeing significant amounts of these
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
contaminants in their product
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
second proponents pointed to the one
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
instance where a company in
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
massachusetts provided water robot that
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
tested high for levels of pfas an
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
important point to cite is that several
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
other providers were also tested with
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
limited traces of pfas in their water
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
and that one provider faced consequences
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
and went out of business
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
it's for these reasons we requested the
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee not report this bill and allow
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
for national standards to best determine
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
contaminant man thank you and i'm happy
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
cnn we thank you very much oh well we're
 
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.389 align:start position:0%
cnn we thank you very much oh well we're
getting

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
what was your testimony about
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
my question was your testimony about
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 265 or house bill 335
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh well it was for 265 today's bill but
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
we have to we testified a couple weeks
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
ago on 335 as well
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions seeing them we
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you have a good day uh re
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
representing me use sorry i should have
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
called you first
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
well well thank you very much mr
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
chairman um i uh testified in front of
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
the committee on hb uh 335 and i'm just
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
here to lend my voice my in support of
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh hb 265 as a co-sponsor as
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative rung said it is uh
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
identical uh to the previous bill and
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i think the the issues we face with
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh with this bill are identical um
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
i think there are a lot of communities
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
including mine in new hampshire that
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
have found themselves on the on the
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
wrong side of water contamination issues
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
and when that happens people turn to
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
bottled water and one of the things that
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
they they take for granted that maybe
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't take for granted
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
is that that water um
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh actually is less contaminated than
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
the water that they're trying to get
 
00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:20.629 align:start position:0%
the water that they're trying to get
away

00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
that they're being told not to drink
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
um this the idea that a situation uh
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
like the one that occurred with the
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
spring hill bottling company
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago the idea that that
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
could occur in new hampshire uh is
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
extremely bothersome especially now that
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
we've updated our pfas standards
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
so to me
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
i think the the biggest issue here in
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
is that people actually have a way to
 
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.069 align:start position:0%
is that people actually have a way to
know

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:50.949 align:start position:0%
know
which

00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
bottled water they're drinking has
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
actually met our state standards and
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
which which hasn't
 
00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:57.910 align:start position:0%
which which hasn't
um

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.710 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
one way to do that would be to simply
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
require that the bar that all bottled
 
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.829 align:start position:0%
require that the bar that all bottled
water

00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh be certified as having having passed
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire standards and that
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
would probably be the preferable way to
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
do it that that way uh nobody
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
would be in a position where they're
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water that might be potentially
 
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.430 align:start position:0%
drinking water that might be potentially
contaminated

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
contaminated
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
another way to do it might be to
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
require stores to
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh to simply put water that has been
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
tested and meets new
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire standards in one area of a
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
uh prominently labeled uh the display
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
itself uh and then to have another
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh section uh for water that that hasn't
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
met our standards
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
um to me the key thing is uh
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
is the the public
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
really does have a right to know um if
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
water like this is tested uh and and and
 
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
meets our standards um so i i urge you
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to pass one of these bills uh
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
and to retain uh the other
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
great uh representative abramson has a
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
oops sorry thank you mr chair and thank
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question oh am i on
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
mute nope nope sorry still not used i'm
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
still not used to this
 
00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:23.829 align:start position:0%
still not used to this
um

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned the uh
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh higher new hampshire standards uh had
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
you guys when you worked on this uh
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
worked this idea out originally
 
00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:34.310 align:start position:0%
worked this idea out originally
um

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
considered the idea of having like a a
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
label or a sticker or certification of
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
some kind that uh
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
bottled water manufacturers could put a
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
little new hampshire symbol on there if
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
they met certain higher standards
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
something they could do voluntarily that
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
would also
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
maybe have a little more selling value
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
for the end consumer
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that was an idea
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
that was kicked around by one of the
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
committees the original bill
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh that we looked at i think a couple of
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
would have required posting the the
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
actual uh test results on the on the
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
bottle itself which is a little bit
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
different you know it sounds like what
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
you were what you're talking about is
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
something that basically just says um
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
certified in compliance when you know
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire standards um
 
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.470 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire standards um
uh

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
to me that would be an acceptable idea
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
again it's a matter of people knowing
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
what they're drinking
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay fair enough actually the you know
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
the follow-up of that question and i
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
guess the curse of being around as long
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
as i have or maybe it's a benefit is um
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
this is sort of like we had with the
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
bovine growth hormones
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
and the issue was mandating that uh
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
labeling of the product whether had
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
whether the farmers were using bovine
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
growth hormones
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
and the end result was that because
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
enough consumers i guess cared or they
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to know that whether the farmers
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
were doing it or not that the
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturers put right on their little
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
sticker like you were saying sticker
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's what max said that
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
in my mind they started out with
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
stickers and then they would actually
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
put on the package and i think even
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
today you'll see on the package it says
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know no growth hormone so so why
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make more sense that that
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation you know wouldn't need
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
as just being doubles up again would
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
need legislation if the consumers truly
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to know whether
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
you know pfats were in their water
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they wouldn't it make sense for
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
these markers the bottle markers to put
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
mr cherry i think there's there is an
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
aspect of this where there are times
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
when people
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
just don't want to know um and and
 
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.910 align:start position:0%
just don't want to know um and and
probably

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
one of the one of those times is is when
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
their water is contaminated and they're
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
actually looking uh you know to bottled
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
water as some sort of a remedy you know
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
but but i do believe that there's
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
something to the idea that if we have uh
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh if we have some sort of a label on
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
the bottle then people can see that and
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
they understand what it means
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
um that could drive uh more demand for
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
for water that's actually been certified
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know to meet the standards
 
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.630 align:start position:0%
you know to meet the standards
um

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking for something that will
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
kick this off because when i go to
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
market basket and when i go to
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
hannaford's i have no way of knowing if
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
any of the bottled water that i buy and
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
i do buy poland spring um
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
i have no way of knowing if that if that
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
water really you know complies with the
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
standards and it's something i think
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's always in the back of my mind but
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not one of the people who
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
was affected by the contamination at
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
pease i'm not one of the people who was
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
affected by cochlea and i think there's
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
a very real concern you know for people
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
who've already had
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
pfas exposure about potentially
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
adding anything to their bodies on top
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
because as we've all heard in testimony
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
on all of the other pfas bills
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
pfas accumulates
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
your body actually doesn't have any good
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
way of getting rid of it
 
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.590 align:start position:0%
way of getting rid of it
so

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
i think this is
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
sort of maybe
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
not a top of mind issue for people who
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
live outside areas that are contaminated
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
but it's very much a top of mind issue
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative everybody's had their
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
question first question okay
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative abramson is your hand
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
from yeah i was no i was trying to do a
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
a a bit of a follow-up um
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
if i might
 
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.270 align:start position:0%
if i might
sure

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh so my my thought was hope i guess you
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
can't see it but we have logos nh logos
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
and things like that maybe if there was
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
something where we
 
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.029 align:start position:0%
something where we
um

00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
if we could do this with your bill if
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're not objecting to it
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
have some kind of logo or label that
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
bottlers would be allowed to to put on
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
if they met the higher new hampshire
 
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.630 align:start position:0%
if they met the higher new hampshire
standards

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
just as a voluntary thing that the
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
company could do and
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
also show that new hampshire cares about
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
well i think this bill is all about
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
water meeting the standards and and
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
providing consumers with a way to know
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
about that i'm a i'm a co-sponsor this
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
is actually a representative cushing's
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill so i'm not sure what his take would
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
be on this but
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
but to me anything that moves us further
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
down the road of consumers being
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
informed about what they're drinking
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative patusek
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question for uh mr toner if
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
he's still
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh about he's he's done he's so we're
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
all set
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
you can ask
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%

stakeholders to inform them of the
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
proposal revisions and our final
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
proposed rules are projected to be
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
before the new hampshire joint
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
rules in june of 2021
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
should the spill move forward the
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
department does have one suggestion to
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
add the following language to the
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
proposed bill to provide clarity that
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
these requirements will only apply to
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
bottled water offered for retail sale in
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the department made a
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
similar suggestion for hp 335.
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is the suggested language changes
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
um are on lines 26 and 27 of the
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
legislation as follows
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
so in line 26 the words we would propose
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
to strike the words for retail sale at
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
the very end of that line
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
and then in line 27 we would propose to
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
add in
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
for retail sale in new hampshire after
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
the word state
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
so the sentence that is in lines 26
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
through 29 of the legislation
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
would read and the sentence begins part
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
way through line 26 with the word all
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
so the sentence would now we propose
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
that the sentence would read all bottled
 
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.590 align:start position:0%
that the sentence would read all bottled
water

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
manufactured or bottled out of state
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
for retail sale in new hampshire shall
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
comply with the requirements specified
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
in departmental rules under rsa 143
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
colon 6 and maximum contaminate
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
contaminant levels established under rsa
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
485 and again this is similar
 
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.149 align:start position:0%
485 and again this is similar
proposed

00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
language we offered up in hb
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
335 as well
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
this concludes my testimony and i'm

and there is more information
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
we need to

um
yeah

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
so i move that we retain this
 
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.269 align:start position:0%
so i move that we retain this
for

00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um while i understand
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
that um many things are working progress
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
there are many immediacies that we have
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
to look at this is a bill that that
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
stems from the unnecessary death of a
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
young lady and probably has impacted
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
many many lives uh on that basis and and
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
on the basis of the need of the people
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
going forward i do believe that we
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
should not retain this bill that an
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
autopass recommendation would be much
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
fairer to our constituents and much
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
fairer to the health of american
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
constituents thank you
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%

thanks very much uh mr chair um i'm a
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
little curious
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
about representative batucci saying we
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
need more information i mean we've had
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
two years of this we passed it um
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly last year we had lots of
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
testimony this year
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative fargo i just want to
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
reiterate what both of my colleagues
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
have said you know we did pass this last
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
term this is an important bill um
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
continuing to push it out is not helping
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
anyone i think that we need to move
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%

speak to your motion
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh there were a lot of
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh statements a lot of anecdotes mostly
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh and mostly centered around one or two
 
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.389 align:start position:0%
uh and mostly centered around one or two
examples

00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
examples
 
00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:33.669 align:start position:0%
examples
uh

00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
and what we're looking at doing is maybe
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
amending this to make it a two-year
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
commission if i remember correctly
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a proposal to do it's mostly
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
an unregulated business
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
just trying to retain this to to make
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
sure that we are
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
actually obtaining what we're seeking to
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish with this type of bill uh
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
because it is such an unregulated
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
business if
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
just trying to go back and remember i've
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
got all my notes here but uh
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
trying to find what's relevant to it but
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
if we retain it we can at least make a
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
better bill out of it
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
and have it go for a couple of years
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
would probably make the most sense right
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative bartlett your
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%

thanks very much uh mr chair um yes the
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
we also agree that this um looks like
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
there's a real need uh for more study on
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
this um and we would agree to a a
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
two-year commission would be a good idea
 
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.789 align:start position:0%
two-year commission would be a good idea
with

00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%

obviously in a different direction
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately with the bill but i think
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
either way the retained motion i think
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
is the right way to go
 
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.710 align:start position:0%
is the right way to go

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
o526
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment to which representative
 
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.069 align:start position:0%
the amendment to which representative
patusik

00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
patusik
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
referred and i'm not sure
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
how that would be different in the
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
so although
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
although i think this is fine as is and
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
i believe the amendment is just tweak
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
the language this was just a matter of

house bill 171 relative to food in cigar

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
shops
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
this bill provides snacks
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
for those who are in cigar bars who are
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
smoking their cigars and perhaps
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
imbibing in
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
some type of beverage uh everyone i
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
believe agrees that if you're going to
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
imbibe in some kind of beverage it's
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
good to have something in your stomach
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
so this bill would provide that at uh no
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
additional cost
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
and uh does not allow sale which means
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
he's much pre-provided
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh free of charge
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
which works for me because i'm cheap
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i believe it's a good bill and uh
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
even the
 
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.589 align:start position:0%
even the
liquor

00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
administration agrees that it would be
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
good for
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
them and it's good for business and i'm
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.550 align:start position:0%

what representative patuck said it's a
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
good idea to allow people that are going

to be drinking liquor to also have
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
food in their stomach there is no retail
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
the we again this is another senate bill
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's coming over it's hotly contested
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the senate and they're working on it
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
um i believe the the department has got
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
a resolution
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
um so rather than trying to amend this
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
bill um my fear is always said and that
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
something could get lost in the wash or
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
the coveted shuffle and so by retaining
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
it at least we can have it come
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
september and make sure it's
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem we can at least get
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
it passed in january so but i'm hoping
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
everything is going to go smoothly so we
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%

00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
i just think this bill needs some work
 
00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:24.870 align:start position:0%
i just think this bill needs some work
it's

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
well clearly that
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
there was some issues whether we
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
actually really want to repeal it is
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
another story but there was definitely
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
some issues with the current statute
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
that probably cleaned up representative
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
fargo i hear you've been doing some
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
homework on this bill
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah i i
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's a whole lot to
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
work with here
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
i would like to see at ito this is
 
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.750 align:start position:0%
i would like to see at ito this is
um

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
repealing this the reason we were here
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
is because we represent consumers and
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
this is a consumer protection bill
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
and our law and what it does is it
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
protects people from
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
moving companies charging them
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know taking their goods for hostage
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
changing prices um it
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
it protects people from um
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
companies that discriminate against
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
peoples or localities i mean i see the
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
importance of this bill and repealing it
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
to me i just don't feel good about that
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
itl but as you might remember there was
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
that thing about where they had to make
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
a statement about how they were worthy
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
to be driving on the state highways
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
don't you think we should get rid of
 
00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.550 align:start position:0%
don't you think we should get rid of
that

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
fair enough representative bartlett
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair i am looking at
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet however i mean i i agree
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
those who were testifying didn't do a
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
particularly good job in informing the
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
committee um with what the issues are
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
but i do think we need to keep looking
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
at it and we had seven in support
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
of of repealing but
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
i have a hard time
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
wanting to repeal it without knowing
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
more about it
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
um so i do understand the retain
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
part of it um
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
to not support i mean to
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
not support this motion of i mean sorry
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
to not support
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
the retain i think i'd rather just
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
rather kill it but
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's sort of where i am
 
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.430 align:start position:0%
that's sort of where i am
okay

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think it's obvious
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
from the previous testimony here and the
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
exec and for the testimony at the
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
hearing that there's just too much going
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
on in this bill we've not been able to
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
give it adequate time and i don't think
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
we can give it adequate time given the
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
number of bills that may are likely to
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
be retained
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
for the fall uh this bill probably needs
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
a total reworking and a total uh parsing
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
out of its individual parts therefore i
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
believe itl is the fairest thing to do
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
unless we can give it due and adequate
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
time in order to rectify something that
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
is inherently
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
flawed in many ways thank you
 
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.589 align:start position:0%
flawed in many ways thank you
okay

00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is to retain
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.589 align:start position:0%
 
hi

00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
so this one i think we need to work so
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
that we can try to include
 
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.150 align:start position:0%
that we can try to include
the

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.309 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
we pay uh the pre-made food so people
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
can get that and have that included
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
in the total number and
 
00:49:26.079 --> 00:49:27.190 align:start position:0%
in the total number and
maybe

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know i think that would be a lot
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
better we can actually get some revenue
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
out of it they can include those
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
pieces into it so i think we should
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
retain it to
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
represent john do you mind turning your
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
computer down a little bit we just like
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
to see all of you
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
there you go thanks
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative fargo
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah i
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
i think we should i teal this bill i
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
i see
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's a value in small neighborhoods
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
for seniors and folks without cars to be
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
able to get groceries within their own
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
communities and um
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
i just even the liquor commission did
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
not see this as necessary and i i think
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
we we don't want to have a lot of
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
neighborhood liquor stores um
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
i just i don't see the value in this
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill at all and i i would i tell this so
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm gonna have to vote against the
 
00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:25.510 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm gonna have to vote against the
retain

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
fair enough representative abramson
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
so this was my bill and it's it's
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
created to deal with the uh problem i
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
agree with the retained motion because
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of different members with
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
different opinions on what should be
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
done ultimately with the bill
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
and it's an
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
intended to deal with a pretty large
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
convenience stores around the state
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
that have to
 
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.430 align:start position:0%
that have to
stock

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
stock
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
what at least in seabrook are dusty cans
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
of spam and eight dollar boxes of
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
cheerios and condensed milk and when we
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
go to the shelves and you run your
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
finger along the top it's obvious that
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
this three thousand dollars in inventory
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
is not selling in some of these stores
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
and they tell us that that they almost
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
never sell any of this stuff and they
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to sell any of this stuff
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's just damned inconvenient to keep it
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
around so different members of the
 
00:51:18.559 --> 00:51:19.670 align:start position:0%
around so different members of the
committee

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh wanted to do different things so i
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
think that the retain motion is probably
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
the the emphasis or the the use of the
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
term convenience stores
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
i think is part of the problem that we
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here when you think of
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
a convenience store it's uh it's the the
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
7-eleven type stores uh but the stores
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
that this bill would affect are stores
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
where the emphasis
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
the the sales emphasis or the draw to
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
the store
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh small food items it's actually
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
the alcohol the the cigarettes the
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
tobacco products whatever um and that
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
sort so if the food that is being sold
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
in those stores is something that's
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's required by law uh to be added to
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
the inventory of the store and so
 
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.950 align:start position:0%
the inventory of the store and so
um

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
the the the person who's going into the
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
store is really not there to buy food
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
the emphasis is not food it's just they
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
have to have food to get their license
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
the uh what's being talked about is
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
being uh
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
to tweak the bill uh and support for
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
retaining it to be able to add it to it
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
would just be a allow for food service
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
to be added to be included in that three
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so that it is actually
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
sales and the added benefit of uh the
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
meals uh the meals tax that would get
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
applied to it which which otherwise
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
would not be because of their of regular
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
grocery sales so i think retaining it
 
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
allows us to
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
actually do something that would uh
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
again it's
 
00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.430 align:start position:0%
again it's
this

00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
the current the stores that are affected
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
by this are not food stores they're just
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
required to sell food with the alcohol
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
so this would allow them to be able to
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i would just argue that um spam and
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
dusty cheerios may not actually be
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
considered food particularly the spam
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
part and that uh i think gross of these
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
stores have uh have the ability to sell
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
to buy anything that will sell
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason for them to have
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
items on this on the shelves that nobody
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
will buy so for that reason um i i i'm
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
i did not see that going that way so
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately spam is considered a
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
canned food much like tuna
 
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.549 align:start position:0%
canned food much like tuna
so

00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um yeah i have the
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
definition of a convenience store here
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
which is a store this extended opening
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
hours in a convenient location stocking
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
limited range of household goods and
 
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.510 align:start position:0%
limited range of household goods and
groceries

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
groceries
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
what i believe um
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
some representatives are talking about
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
are liquor stores
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
because if you want
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to just sell beer and wine
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that is you know what you're going
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be selling there um
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
that's a liquor store
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
so i am going to itl this bill
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right just so i guess the way i
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
perceive this situation is that i i
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
understand representable you're worried
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
about package stores that they're in
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
other states because when you say liquor
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
store in new hampshire it
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
something totally different obviously um
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
but no i think the uh the discussion
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
point was uh that um we have this three
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar food requirement and
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're uh and i and i believe uh i know
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
for a fact that the uh chief of enforcer
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
he agreed uh with me when i said
 
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make sense that food that
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
you could actually eat right then and
 
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.670 align:start position:0%
you could actually eat right then and
there

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
like a food service kind of type you
 
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.150 align:start position:0%
like a food service kind of type you
know

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that actually better
 
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.470 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that actually better
to

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
fulfill the food requirement and he
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
agreed so that's for that reason
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
retaining it makes a lot of sense
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
have to oppose this
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
this motion um i i just don't do not
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
think there's a a way to amend this um
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
and to spend more time on it with an
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
awful lot of bills are retaining
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
um and i'm i'm going to um oppose the
 
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.870 align:start position:0%
um and i'm i'm going to um oppose the
motion

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
did you say 274
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
who 64. oh 264. um
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i thought that that the need was to
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
retain this uh
 
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
disclaimer i'm a republican and we like
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
to save money and we like to shop around
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
um i thought that the idea
 
00:57:48.559 --> 00:57:50.549 align:start position:0%
um i thought that the idea
behind

00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
behind
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
this bill was
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
that you would go to a doctor's office
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
or a hospital or or or
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
any medical provider and when you're
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
when you're calling around you want to
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
get an estimate just like when you're
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
trying to do car work or or buy
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
insurance or anything else i thought i
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
felt that that was the idea that
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative mclean was was promoting
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
um i thought that that was uh
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
good but the sponsor admitted that there
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
may under kind of cross-examination that
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
there may be some issues with the
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
language of the bill
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
but that there wasn't anything
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
structurally wrong and that we may be
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
able to just clean up the language a bit
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
maybe get something good out of this
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
so that's why i thought it needed to be
 
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.750 align:start position:0%
so that's why i thought it needed to be
retained

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartlett thank you mr
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
chair i don't know there's there's any
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
way that the testimony that we all heard
 
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.349 align:start position:0%
way that the testimony that we all heard
um

00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be able to to
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
so-called clean up this bill um
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
there are so many different ways that
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
the um health care costs are figured
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
um there is no retail cost per say
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh whether it's medicare whether it's
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid whether it's private insurance
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
um i just don't think there's
 
00:59:03.119 --> 00:59:04.710 align:start position:0%
um i just don't think there's
there's

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
we can put the effort in
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
to make this fit everybody
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and that's what the law is supposed
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.359 --> 00:59:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay did we just lose representative
 
00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:28.789 align:start position:0%
okay did we just lose representative
palmer

00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i think so
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
so i guess we have win win problem win
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it's blowing here that's for sure
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
employment he's in plymouth right he's
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
in plymouth i still have power
 
00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.190 align:start position:0%
in plymouth i still have power
yeah

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.870 align:start position:0%
yeah
huh

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
huh
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative fargo
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah i
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
listened to what paula minihan had to
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
say the feds passed the transparency
 
00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.190 align:start position:0%
say the feds passed the transparency
regulation

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
um in 2019 that's effective january 1st
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to solve a lot of this
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
um i just i don't see a need for this
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
bill there's too much work to make it
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
even a viable i i just i think there are
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
other bills that probably would warrant
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
the work
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
before this one so i would i can't i'd
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative burroughs
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i was just gonna just
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
gonna add that most doctors um don't
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
have access to the information that
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
would be required
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
to fulfill this requirement most doctors
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
don't know the codes
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
that are used by insurance companies
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
they don't know the monetary value of
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
the code so for that reason i'm going to
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.359 --> 01:00:45.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i think um
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative mclaren is trying to get
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
your attention too but he didn't hit the
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
raise your hand button i can't find that
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
one oh it's um look on the bottom screen
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
look on the bottom and just touch the
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
bottom where this task bar is and there
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
should be a reactions and you can raise
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
your hand there but
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
anyway at any rate i i don't think this
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
bill is workable at all i i think that
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh it would take a clairvoyant to uh
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
actually come up with an answer that's
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
even close to an estimate i just don't
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
think it's workable
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
representative berlin now you have a
 
01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:28.950 align:start position:0%
representative berlin now you have a
question

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um mr chair in addition
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
paula minneham
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
testified that this wouldn't apply to
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
private doctor's office
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
tyler brennan came to us from the
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
insurance department there's already
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
um a place on the website that gives you
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
a rough idea of what costs are
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
from various hospitals or various
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
some service providers but to put the
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
work into this there's just i don't
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
believe there's any way
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to to fashion a
 
01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.589 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to to fashion a
bill

01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
that is going to meet the the goal of of
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
i have to vote itl
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative abramson
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh one of the ideas that was brought up
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
at the hearing was that perhaps the
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
hospital or clinic or service provider
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
might just provide the information that
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
they have present at that time
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so but we would have to discuss that
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
question and challenge that and see is
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
is that beneficial or not or is that
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
necessary are there other ways to do it
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why retaining just makes more
 
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.390 align:start position:0%
and that's why retaining just makes more
sense

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative patusek
 
01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
like representative abramson i believe
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
there is more information to be gotten
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i also agree that yes there are
 
01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.589 align:start position:0%
and i also agree that yes there are
standardized

01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
standardized
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
type of
 
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.829 align:start position:0%
type of
tables

01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
tables
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
available on the internet that would
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
give you a rough idea but i think if the
 
01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.030 align:start position:0%
give you a rough idea but i think if the
the

01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor would come back with some more
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
information would make this a more
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
workable bill
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
i see that i see this as we have two
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
choices we can
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
give this a quick test now
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
or we can
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
let it die
 
01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
let it die
uh

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
in the fall
 
01:03:27.359 --> 01:03:28.309 align:start position:0%
in the fall
and

01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay any more discussion on
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
the motion of retaining 264.
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none when you got you two uh
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%

moving on um
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
next i have on my list uh is actually
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 265 was technically not
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
list for bills to be exact today
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
and it is normally not my personality to
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
ever kill a bill or
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
pass a bill on the same day we heard it
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
um i always thought that every bill
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
should get 24 hours of life however this
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
we have this a
 
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.270 align:start position:0%
we have this a
different

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
situation because we have another bill
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
related to it so um
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
i guess uh uh
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
how the house the committee feels or
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
anybody has a problem for us taking up
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
this bill now
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
actually mr chairman it wasn't listed in
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
the calendar no it wasn't listen to
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
calendar but because we heard it today
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
oh you could okay you're right
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
so that you can just you list so many of
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
them i thought you
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
so this is so into in you know this
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
isn't what i would ever do but yeah
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett um thanks mr
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair um no i have spoken with the
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors on this and they understood our
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
position um and i'm i'm fine with with
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
executing it now
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
but for the record i would never do this
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know generally
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
we understand it's it will definitely
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
my personality to do something like this
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
but okay uh representative abramson uh
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%

so
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
i like the idea of the bill but
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
we already have house bill 335 that were
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
that we're proposing to retain so
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's nothing personal but this is
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as uh 335 so
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
as the uh as the introducer suggested
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh first thing i moved that we itl this

drop them like floss
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%

to move unanimously
 
01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.590 align:start position:0%
to move unanimously
okay

01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh i'm wondering if we should put some
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a disclaimer
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
about today and the weather
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
um i don't i don't know but i wouldn't
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
be surprised if i come up uh missing
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
soon it is the wind is blowing
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
so ferociously that i
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
i feel and and hear it unbelievably out
 
01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.110 align:start position:0%
i feel and and hear it unbelievably out
there

01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
so i may i may lose electricity i'm not
 
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.470 align:start position:0%
so i may i may lose electricity i'm not
sure

01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
i just lost mine for a few minutes and
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
dropped out so i might okay you're back
 
01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.350 align:start position:0%
dropped out so i might okay you're back
yep

01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
yep
yeah

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.390 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
some of plymouth loses power and some
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
does not amazing i mean i'm sure that um
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
reps um mclear and burroughs are trying
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
to get back in
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
right as they can with even if it's just
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
by phone we can we can live with that
 
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
and i would have to write down the phone
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
number just in case that happens i'm
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to look it up and write it
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
down because i won't have access to
 
01:12:57.199 --> 01:12:58.310 align:start position:0%
down because i won't have access to
the

01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
computer anyway
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
does it violate house rules if we're not
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
on video yeah that's uh
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
we have to be on video we have to see
 
01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.310 align:start position:0%
we have to be on video we have to see
faces

01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
faces
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative osborne
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh yes we do have rules that we need to
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
follow uh however um would it be
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate to um
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
make a
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
gentle lady and gentleman's agreement
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
that if someone on one side is to drop
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
off someone on the other side will take
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
a walk
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh right well this uh the senate calls
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
this pairing
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
because of the 24 of them they would do
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
that if someone was unable to
 
01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.910 align:start position:0%
that if someone was unable to
participate

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
someone else would not participate
 
01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.510 align:start position:0%
someone else would not participate
so

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to do that if everyone else
 
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to do that if everyone else
is

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
i i think that would be a good
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
thing yeah because there's we have no
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
control over you know who it is it's
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to get dropped off it could happen
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
to any of us
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise what will happen is if the
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
vote goes awry
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
then tomorrow when we come back we're
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to go through a bunch of
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
reconsideration motions and that's not
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to be good for anybody
 
01:14:03.199 --> 01:14:04.870 align:start position:0%
going to be good for anybody
exactly

01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
um okay representative abramson you had
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
your hand up i actually disagree with
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
that if that were to happen
 
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.310 align:start position:0%
that if that were to happen
um

01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know i would honestly rather do
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
reconsideration but as far as the rules
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
are concerned rules of the house we're
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
no longer republicans and democrats and
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
if some i
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
i don't like doing the zoom uh meetings
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
at all i would rather meet in the lob
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
but i've already stated that issue um
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
earlier and
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh as as far as the house rules are
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
concerned if you're a member you're here
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
if you if if if somebody drops out um i
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think that we could do if they can
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
come back on later today we could just
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
do the reconsideration or the chair can
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
just hold the vote up until the end of
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
the day if it's really
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
you know if we lose too many members
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay so well that's represent terry go
 
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.110 align:start position:0%
okay so well that's represent terry go
ahead

01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with this as long as the
 
01:15:00.159 --> 01:15:01.430 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with this as long as the
reasons

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh are spread on the minutes as to why
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
each member
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
did not participate for example if i
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
were to pair even though i'm present
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
somebody couldn't come back at me and
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
say you know why didn't you vote on that
 
01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.149 align:start position:0%
say you know why didn't you vote on that
bill

01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh why did you take a walk on that bill
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to remember so um can
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
you assure us that the reasons will be
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
spread on the
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the minutes of the meeting
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
indicating that somebody wasn't there
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
because their power was lost and
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
somebody else graciously dropped out in
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
order to pair
 
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:31.990 align:start position:0%
order to pair
um

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
on the forum there's a not voting column
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
i could put
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
a note in that column but that's about
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
it there's we're really not taking
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
minutes other than the votes on this
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
well as long as it's recorded
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
right i but i have to tell you that i'm
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
the the worst panic in my mind is
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we send some bill out on the floor
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
with a 10-10 you know a nine-nine vote i
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
mean that i i hope i don't i've never
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
wanted my committees ever
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
to have a split decision go to the house
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
floor um but so i would probably do
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
everything possible to avoid that but
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
yet you're right we can reconsider
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
but then i am the chair so i can control
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
which bill we take up next uh and even
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
though i said i would take them in
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
numeric order
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
i certainly can be conscious of which
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
ones we take up and what order we take
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
them up in um and hope that uh these
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
other people
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
i i have texted both of them to see if
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
there's a way they can resume in in by
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
phone but um i haven't heard back from
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
either of them so i don't know
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
if they don't have phone either not
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to do by phone unfortunately so
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
unless they have a smart smartphone
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
um and can we have smartphones
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
right so they have they have smartphones
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
download the download the zoom app and
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
log in by the link
 
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
right right and
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
evidently doesn't take up a lot so okay
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um anita burroughs just wrote
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
back she they have lost power and she's
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
going to try to get in by phone he's
 
01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.350 align:start position:0%
going to try to get in by phone he's
here

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh yeah representative there she is
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
it seems like we're wasting more time in
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
the interest of saving time so
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
do you think we should uh just do the
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
the bills that are uh you know are going
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
to be unanimous and uh save the other
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
ones till tomorrow since we're meeting
 
01:17:22.719 --> 01:17:23.830 align:start position:0%
ones till tomorrow since we're meeting
anyway

01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
um we uh we can certainly certainly go
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
through that i i
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how much we're going to be
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
unanimous but we'll but i i guess um if
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
you uh indulge me in talking
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to exact some bills and the
 
01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:40.470 align:start position:0%
lights will go on
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:43.110 align:start position:0%
lights will go on
[Laughter]

01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
all right so the next up is a uh banking
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
department bill so i assume we uh it's
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
gonna be now the first one up is the the
 
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh repair bill
 
01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.550 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh repair bill
um

01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.350 align:start position:0%
um
i

01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
assume that's gonna be a split decision
 
01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.189 align:start position:0%
assume that's gonna be a split decision
so

01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
no we're okay with that one no we're
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
okay with that one okay uh all right
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
well representative hands second by
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative patusek moves in
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
expanding to legislate and house bill
 
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.669 align:start position:0%
expanding to legislate and house bill
310

01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
310
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
and representative ham is recognized to
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
speak to her motion
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank thank you mr speaker i recommend
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate on a house
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
bill 310 the vehicle repair bill
 
01:18:22.159 --> 01:18:23.189 align:start position:0%
bill 310 the vehicle repair bill
um

01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons i
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
do not think there's sufficient evidence
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
that consumers
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
adjusters vehicle repair shops
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
auto dealers and all the parties
 
01:18:38.159 --> 01:18:39.750 align:start position:0%
auto dealers and all the parties
involved

01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
can't come to
 
01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
can't come to
a

01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
a reasonable decision
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
to accommodate a safe repair
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
to the vehicle to
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
pre-loss condition um taking advantage
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
of manufactured parts um off market
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
parts or whatever it seems to be working
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's needed i don't think
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's enough uh evidence that unsafe
 
01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.630 align:start position:0%
there's enough uh evidence that unsafe
vehicles

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
are coming out of uh repair shops and or
 
01:19:13.679 --> 01:19:15.189 align:start position:0%
are coming out of uh repair shops and or
consumers

01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
are losing their ability to
 
01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
are losing their ability to
negotiate

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
negotiate
 
01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:19.830 align:start position:0%
negotiate
for

01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
the uh repairs that they feel necessary
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
to their vehicle
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative bartlett thanks very
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
much mr chair um coming from the
 
01:19:29.679 --> 01:19:30.950 align:start position:0%
much mr chair um coming from the
insurance

01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
side of things in in my career
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
i don't i have to oppose this bill i
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
don't believe that
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
authorizing unsafe repairs um we also on
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
our blue sheets had 14 opposed to this
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
bill with five in favor i'm just
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
bringing that up um that those that that
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
were interested
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the in the issue
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
and i just don't think that we heard
 
01:19:57.679 --> 01:19:58.870 align:start position:0%
and i just don't think that we heard
um

01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
as i agree with representative ham i
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe that we heard testimony
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
is an issue that is um coming up on a
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
so i agree with the itl motion um
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
even though i recognize that there's a
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
problem the bill is trying to solve
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
um i felt that there were structural
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
issues with the way that the bill was
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
worked out and the way it would operate
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't think
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that we can solve
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
structural problems within the in the
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee we can deal with typos and
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
language issues and small small things
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
but i think that the the sponsors would
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
have to go back to the stakeholders and
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
come up with a different solution to the
 
01:20:38.159 --> 01:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
come up with a different solution to the
problem

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
so that's why i didn't think that that
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
retaining would
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't think that we could fix the
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
problem internally
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on the motion
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
of anything speaking to legislate on
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 310 saying none
 
01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:54.640 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with representative
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
abramson's uh backdrop i think it's
 
01:31:25.679 --> 01:31:26.870 align:start position:0%
abramson's uh backdrop i think it's
offensive

01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
offensive
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
that that myself today was that i would
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh tell him that um
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
i think you know
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
we don't really have any rules about it
 
01:31:37.679 --> 01:31:38.390 align:start position:0%
we don't really have any rules about it
but

01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
anything that's got words in it is
 
01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.510 align:start position:0%
anything that's got words in it is
probably

01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
inappropriate but i don't know i think
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
the shadow is pretty offensive i don't
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
know if you've seen the shadow but well
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
i guess i wasn't paying attention to the
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
shadow uh-huh it wasn't there the other
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.669 align:start position:0%
so just i i just
was

01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%

videos on so that we can
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%

01:34:40.159 --> 01:34:41.510 align:start position:0%
yeah just getting uh back

01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
rich is up okay and hopefully connie

01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
me all right perfect okay
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative abramson
 
01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
represent uh seconded by representative
 
01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.510 align:start position:0%
represent uh seconded by representative
patusik

01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
patusik
 
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.950 align:start position:0%
patusik
um

01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
to retain house bill 333 and
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative abramson is recognized to
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
speak to his motion
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh so members uh disagreed
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
apparently disagreed based on the
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing and afterwards about where
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
he wanted to go
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
with the bill so it didn't look like it
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
was possible to come up with an
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
amendment before the executive session
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh and for that reason because this
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
touches on a lot of different issues
 
01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
and requires a little bit more research
 
01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.470 align:start position:0%
and requires a little bit more research
on

01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
what federal issues are and what other
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
states are doing
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
i felt that we needed to retain this
 
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.070 align:start position:0%
i felt that we needed to retain this
bill

01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
and and kind of reopen reopen that whole
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative fargo
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah i i
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
i think that there's some merit we need
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
to look closer at this i don't think
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is ready for prime time as it
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
stands but um
 
01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.270 align:start position:0%
stands but um
i

01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
i i do think this is something that we
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
sorry uh thank you uh mr chair uh i'm
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
going to um i look to over um itl this
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill because i think it is um
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
a bill for special uh interest groups
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
yes i i agree um
 
01:36:26.159 --> 01:36:27.270 align:start position:0%
yes i i agree um
i

01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't uh understand this and without
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
medical advice as to what to uh
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
as to the
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
usefulness of this product um
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
i i could not vote for it so i i'm in
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative still muted
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative bolio says that um this
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
is for special interest and i
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
i think that's who was testifying for us
 
01:37:10.629 --> 01:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
i think that if we do retain this
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
i think we really
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
need dhhs to determine
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
where they stand on this um
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
they testified in the past because we
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
have this bill
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
i think it was two years or three years
 
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:24.950 align:start position:0%
i think it was two years or three years
ago

01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
um where
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
it was changing the classification i
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
i think we need an awful lot more
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
information if we're going to retain it
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to take
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of time
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
that's why we have subcommittees
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
all right representative van gaal
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh very quickly i originally
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
had thought of retaining this bill as
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
well but as i just started up today i
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
was reminded of the fact that we don't
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
even know how to say the word kratom or
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
kratom i had to go to the google
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh to find out that it is kratom so if
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
it is that far out of our range of
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
understanding this i think i will be now
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
i know what it's called
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the motion to
 
01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.550 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the motion to
retain

01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative abramson
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
um i was just going to say really
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
quickly um i believe that the
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
the underlying intent of the bill if you
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
read it and and what the sponsor was
 
01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:26.870 align:start position:0%
read it and and what the sponsor was
saying

01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
is that he wanted to
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
the bill does essentially two things it
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
would prevent anyone from selling
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
adulterated kratom
 
01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.070 align:start position:0%
adulterated kratom
um

01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
which can be used as a tea
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
and he also wanted to
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
have state legislation that prevents it
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
from being sold to people under 18.
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
um it did it it certainly did open up
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
some issues
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
um but i felt that this is an issue with
 
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
whether you
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
oppose the idea of the bill or supported
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
the idea of the bill or wherever you
 
01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:57.990 align:start position:0%
the idea of the bill or wherever you
were

01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
philosophically on
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
the use of kratom as a way of
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
drug addiction
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
or depression that this is something
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
that we needed to study that there were
 
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
several issues in it that needed to be
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
studied so i felt that retain was the
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
most logical approach to dealing with it
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i just was going to say
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
that given that this is a drug that the
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
fda is warning against and the other
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
agency that was brought up by the
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the i think was the
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
kratom institute was not a scientific
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
agency i'm going to vote to itl because
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the pending motion is to retain
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
having no more hands up and i think
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're ready to vote so the clerk will
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
call the role on retaining house bill
 
01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:59.030 align:start position:0%

representative patouzik moves to retain

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:29.590 align:start position:0%
helps bill
335

01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
335
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
and recognized to speak to his motion
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
so i actually liked uh the idea of this
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill but again there were there were
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
some issues in how it's implemented um i
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
thought that retaining the bill to
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
consider the idea of something like uh
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh as we mentioned in the hearing on
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
that it's uh sister bill
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
that uh we
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
you know maybe as an option for for
 
01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
bottlers that we allow them to put a
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
little special new hampshire logo on
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
there that says this meets the higher
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire bottled water standards
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
and i thought that having a voluntary
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
program like that made sense because uh
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
as soon as we started uh subjecting the
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
bill to questions under its current form
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh what if the water is frozen is this
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
going to apply to bags of frozen ice
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
what if it's colored or flavored water
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
or salts or water
 
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
that there were a lot of issues we're
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do this as a mandate probably
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work and then there were some
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
federal issues also epa and fda issues
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
so i thought that
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
retaining it in order to consider some
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
type of optional program um and i
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
believe one of the co-sponsors on this
 
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
or its sister bill uh agreed that that
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%

01:42:48.639 --> 01:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
originally i was gonna otp this but um
whoops

01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
whoops
 
01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:50.950 align:start position:0%

01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
but i i had the dhhs member come to me
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
late on friday afternoon asked me to put
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
in an amendment and it does kind of
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
muddy things up because of rules making
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
the dhhs has been working on
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
so um i will
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
and the amendment should have been
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
distributed to everybody late yesterday
 
01:43:11.679 --> 01:43:12.950 align:start position:0%
distributed to everybody late yesterday
afternoon

01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we've had enough time
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
to um read it all so i will support the
 
01:43:17.199 --> 01:43:19.030 align:start position:0%
to um read it all so i will support the
retain

01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for chair um i do find some
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
confusing aspects to my casting a boat
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
at this moment but i think the bottom
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
line is that um just thinking back to my
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
high school biology classes and my other
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
biology classes about the importance of
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
water and the percentage of the body
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's made up of water and the
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
possibility that we are not supporting
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
the healthiest water supply for all of
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
our citizens i'm i'm
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
i'm leaning toward to pass and i will be
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully able to vote in that manner uh
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
water is just so critically important
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%

representative bartlett can you speak to

01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
what was in the amendment
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
well if the amendment was um referring
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
to rules making um and refers to a rsa
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
um let's see i have it
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
45. it was distributed to everybody but
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
i um i had
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
a number of amendments
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
not not just on this one that i was
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing and i didn't get all the way
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
through this one it came from um
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
abigail and i don't remember her last
 
01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:38.870 align:start position:0%
abigail and i don't remember her last
name

01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
name
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
um and i have not been able to look at
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
the rules making and i and i in my notes
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
i said i remember asking colleen smith
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
that when we had this bill before us
 
01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:49.109 align:start position:0%
that when we had this bill before us
previously

01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:44:49.119 --> 01:44:49.910 align:start position:0%
previously
um

01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
they had also been saying that they were
 
01:44:53.590 --> 01:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
working on the rules and that was
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
at least a year or possibly two years
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
ago so i'm kind of wondering where
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
they want the rules in
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
but they haven't been clear about
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
what the rule what dhs rules are
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
that they're working on and how long
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to take
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why there were too many
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
questions for me
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
well i i think that's even more reason
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
to move ahead with with the ought to
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
pass because if we keep waiting we'll
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
we'll never get clean water from people
 
01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:26.550 align:start position:0%
we'll never get clean water from people
so

01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
i think i i would rather see this pass
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
i mean i have to say for my defense of
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee process i think that
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
when we do that we we are putting the he
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
on departments to
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
to get it straight and give us a good uh
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
good language that we understand and we
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
can get behind
 
01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:44.870 align:start position:0%
can get behind
okay

condominium dispute resolution board
um

01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
too many rules
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's limiting
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's not for condos time shares
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
homeowner associations
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
it just is too much of too much
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i move to itl because a i don't
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative bartlett
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have to say i
 
01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
completely disagree with um
 
01:48:24.159 --> 01:48:25.350 align:start position:0%
completely disagree with um
representative

01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
batucci on this one um i think that we
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
have had year after year
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
of testimony from dozens of people
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of condominiums that we have
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
in this state that there is definitely a
 
01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:40.550 align:start position:0%
in this state that there is definitely a
problem

01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
they cannot resolve all of them through
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
their own boards many of them have
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
property managers
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
is this a perfect film maybe not but
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
i i feel like
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
we have got to be listening
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
to our constituents that are affected
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
so much that they need a resolution
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
board now it doesn't um i it's not meant
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
to include homeowners associations and
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
all these other things that that
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
complicated so it's not in there and i
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't think it belongs in there
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
um the mobile home resolution board has
 
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
been working very well for a number of
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
years and this is modeled after that
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's a really needed bill for many
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
people who are in this state and i
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative van helton
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
i think for what i have found some flaws
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill to mostly related to
 
01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
language and i think that that that can
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
easily be worked out i i may be the only
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
one here that lives in a condominium and
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm well aware of the kinds of disputes
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
that we have seen that could be resolved
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
far more efficiently and and and with
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
greater alacrity than what we have seen
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh what is important to me though is
 
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
that this parallels the manufactured
 
01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:01.830 align:start position:0%
that this parallels the manufactured
housing

01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:02.709 align:start position:0%
housing
um

01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh housing ruling and uh that seems
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
to have met with some success and so if
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're following a model that has seen
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
some success i think it's due time to
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
give the condominium uh owners a chance
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
to resolve their differences without
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
having to go to court without um fights
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
within fights and things of that sort so
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
i would urge
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh that we kill the ito which is a poor
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
choice awards that we do not vote itl
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
and instead that we um vote autopass in
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
as an alternative motion thank you
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
i guess i i feel compelled to interject
 
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
here that this has nothing to do with
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing manufactured
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
housing is you contract with somebody to
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
put up a house for you
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
and and you haven't even moved into it
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay this this is a totally different
 
01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:51.510 align:start position:0%
okay this this is a totally different
situation

01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
you you have bought into this condo you
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
who knows how long you've lived in this
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
condo before you've had whether the
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
issues that you're having so i really
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a fair comparison
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
may i follow up please
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely i simply i i'm simply
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
referring to the manufactured housing uh
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
legislation as a process as a procedure
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
and not in any way shape or manner
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
trying to imply that they're comparable
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that there is a
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
procedure that has worked for another
 
01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:17.669 align:start position:0%
procedure that has worked for another
group

01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
that seems to be amenable to to with
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
this group so
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
i hope i didn't misrepresent when i
 
01:51:25.590 --> 01:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
spoke about that legislation it's just a
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
matter of procedure and process that i
 
01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
see working um the products are very
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
different thank you
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh
 
01:51:34.719 --> 01:51:39.830 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh
bartlett

01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um yeah i i'm
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
i'm a little curious it feels like
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're comparing something different now
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
not every
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
resolution um issue that comes before
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing board has to do
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
with somebody who's contracted to
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
purchase a uh to to buy a house to be
 
01:51:58.880 --> 01:51:59.750 align:start position:0%
purchase a uh to to buy a house to be
built

01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
built
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
these are
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
commission is for those who live in
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing not necessarily
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
because they had it built
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
condominiums aren't necessarily
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
on the resolution board wouldn't
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily be because they were having
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
a condominium built it's because they
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
live there so um
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know i i think we're comparing
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
apples and oranges here but
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
as representative van outen says
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
this is about process this is about
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
those who are not able to
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
come to a
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
resolution without going to court
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
with their own
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
board or other unit owners and it only
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
applies to unit owners
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a really important
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
process to offer the many many thousands
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
of condominium owners
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative abramson
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
um we did we did actually discuss this
 
01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:56.830 align:start position:0%
um we did we did actually discuss this
um

01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
it would certainly be nice to keep condo
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
disputes out of court
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
um 90 of them could be dispensed with
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
pretty uh quickly but i
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm going with the itl motion
 
01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:10.629 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm going with the itl motion
is

01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:53:10.639 --> 01:53:11.669 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know some alternative like uh
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
you know long ago we used to use justice
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
of the peace or constable to handle
 
01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
really small matters there were twenty
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
dollars or something that something was
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
a dispute that was too small even to go
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
to small claims court we used to be
 
01:53:26.070 --> 01:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
handled by justice of the peace or
 
01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:27.270 align:start position:0%
handled by justice of the peace or
constable

01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
constable
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
so if if members wanted to go with a
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
bill like that i would be receptive to
 
01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:33.030 align:start position:0%
bill like that i would be receptive to
that

01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
but again that would be a complete
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
change from what's being proposed in the
 
01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:38.070 align:start position:0%
change from what's being proposed in the
bill

01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:39.030 align:start position:0%
bill
and

01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
it would still leave open the the
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of people going to court i
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
like the idea of using
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know some intermediary step before
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
going to court just to keep court costs
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
down but
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that the
 
01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:51.830 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that the
bill

01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
takes us in the right direction i'm not
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
sure that the committee can fix
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
the bill to do that
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%

and

01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%

uh
so

01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
there are some amendments that the
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor has reached out and said that
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
he'd like to work on um to fix some of
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
these issues because
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
if we pass it the way it's written it
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
would make these um
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
sports bars are these sorry cigar bar is
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
more of a rest
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
like a restaurant which then changes its
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
status so he wants to um work on
 
01:57:07.589 --> 01:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
changing and making amendments so we i
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
retain it
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
so that we can work with him and
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%

make it more of a restaurant and it's
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
kind of like saying we can take a duck
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
and make it into an elephant
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
by retaining it and waiting until
 
01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.189 align:start position:0%
by retaining it and waiting until

restaurant i support ito

01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
moving right along then um so next up is
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 358
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
of all solar collectors on condos
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative terry seconded by
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative patusek moves in expedia
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
to legislate and represent terry is
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:14.159 --> 02:00:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
this bill represents
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
an unwarranted intrusion into the
 
02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:23.589 align:start position:0%
an unwarranted intrusion into the
affairs

02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
of a voluntary association of
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
condominium owners for which there is no
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
compelling government interest at stake
 
02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
to the contrary this bill's intent is to
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
effectively become a stakeholder
 
02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
in an association in which it has no
 
02:00:37.599 --> 02:00:39.189 align:start position:0%
in an association in which it has no
membership

02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
membership
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
in so doing it seeks to require a
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
numerical basis upon which a particular
 
02:00:46.070 --> 02:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
policy must be determined
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
the issue here is not solar
 
02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
it is by whose authority shall a
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
condominium association govern itself
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
and by what rules government has no
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
legal basis for either voice or vote in
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
you're still talking to yourself
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
one more time and talking to myself is
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
not that bad sometimes
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
um i i'm i'm really thinking about that
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
this might probably out of pass
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
as i look back at the legislation i
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
realize that the wording is not
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
anything that binds a condo association
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
it simply allows them to going forward
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
for new docks or new con or condo docks
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
that are altered
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh to to set the majority at 50 or more
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
this means that the condo owners will
 
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
still have their say as to whether the
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
solar should be there or not as i was
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
preparing for this over the last couple
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
of days
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
i received
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
um i believe was a facebook message from
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
um a member of a condo association just
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
north of may
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
freestanding condos and the woman not
 
02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
realizing that this legislation was
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
coming up had shown a picture of how
 
02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
solar would fit very nicely into her
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
free standing condo and estimates that
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
she would improve the value of her condo
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
from eighteen thousand to twenty five
 
02:02:20.070 --> 02:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
um this is an option for her it is her
 
02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
style of condo but i do believe that
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
this kind of legislation would allow
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
that kind of an association to make that
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
decision is that something that they
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
want to put to a vote and it only sets
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
the value of the majority vote
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
so on behalf of my constituents and of
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
those people who have this style of a
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
condominium thing which
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
they have to vote on this is not an
 
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
automatic uh get out of jail
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
pass it does not automatically allow
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
them to have solar energy it does not
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
automatically change any condo documents
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
that currently exist and so i believe
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
that we should give those people who
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
live there the option and the right to
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
make decisions about their own homes
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure that normally for
 
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
anybody to change condo docks you need
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
more than you need like a two-thirds or
 
02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
three-fifths or uh if it's titled it
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
could be eighty percent
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
and while that's true i think we're
 
02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
setting a nice high bar here so that
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
this kind of legislation doesn't doesn't
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
go into effect without for that first
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
happening so i thank you for adding that
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
element to my support oh hi bars 50
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
that's a hybrid no no because what you
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
just said about the changing of the
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
condo docks it is that difficult to
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
change the condo docks going forward and
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
only after that happens can this
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislation trigger because the condo
 
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
docks either have to be brand new docks
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
where they have to be altered docs or
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
amended docs in order to have this
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
legislation pass
 
02:03:48.790 --> 02:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
yeah see i i
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
interpreted this the language of this
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill is that regardless of what the docs
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
say about changing you know your
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
that it would only be a 50
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
but um but it does say that um
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
this shall apply to all condominium
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
instruments and bylaws adopted or
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
revised after the effective date of the
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
section and that's to that that is what
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm referring to and again thank you for
 
02:04:17.109 --> 02:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:20.159 --> 02:04:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
in reading the
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
the bill on this i mean i i think that
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
the intent um from the sponsors is
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
really that we have to make it easier
 
02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.189 align:start position:0%
really that we have to make it easier
for

02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
alternative energy to be an option
 
02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
for condominium
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
unit owners
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to get more expensive to use
 
02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels
 
02:04:47.199 --> 02:04:48.310 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels
and

02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:50.830 --> 02:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
we as a state certainly do not
 
02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
interfere with any kind of a program
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
regarding solar
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
in here i mean if you go to
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts you go down neighborhood
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
after neighborhood and they've all had
 
02:05:02.550 --> 02:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
their solar
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
installations paid for
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
by the state and they have reduced their
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
their use of electricity dramatically
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
but condominium
 
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
unit owners don't have that option
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
where this applies only to
 
02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:16.870 align:start position:0%
where this applies only to
new

02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:18.709 align:start position:0%
new
bylaws

02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
bylaws
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
people who buy a condo are going to know
 
02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
ahead of time that this is that the
 
02:05:23.119 --> 02:05:24.149 align:start position:0%
ahead of time that this is that the
solar

02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
solar
 
02:05:24.159 --> 02:05:25.189 align:start position:0%
solar
um

02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
installation is only going to be
 
02:05:26.639 --> 02:05:27.669 align:start position:0%
installation is only going to be
available

02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:05:30.550 --> 02:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
when um
 
02:05:32.070 --> 02:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
when they buy it
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
so i i'm in favor um of this of this
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
bill so i'm going to vote otp
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chair mr chair um
 
02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
my take
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
away is i'm not against solar that's for
 
02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
sure um but there are a lot of uh condo
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
associations that are substantial in
 
02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:58.310 align:start position:0%
associations that are substantial in
size

02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
size
 
02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
you know getting a a super majority vote
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
commit to putting solar
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
on those places is
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh i think
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to keep it that way
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think the best way of solving the
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
solar problem
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
is to have
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
put in their own solar installations and
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
that way everybody can have solar
 
02:06:26.159 --> 02:06:28.070 align:start position:0%
that way everybody can have solar
electricity

02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
i think i've heard about it
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
but it's not here not in our committee
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion oh what do you
 
02:06:36.079 --> 02:06:36.380 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion oh what do you

some somebody pop it up there you go
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative fargo yes
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
i feel that when you buy into a
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
condominium you know what you're getting
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
into and
 
02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:49.830 align:start position:0%
into and
i

02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
while i think that things should change
 
02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
i i think that 50 is not acceptable in
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
my estimation because there's a
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
financial obligation associated with
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
this for
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
for homeowners and i think the
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:10.840 align:start position:0%

the bill representative prout has
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
actually uh determined itself it is
 
02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and it's
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
requested that we uh not pass this bill
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
as it is written so
 
02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
kind of makes it simple for us as his
 
02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:25.350 align:start position:0%
kind of makes it simple for us as his
recommendation

02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative abramson
 
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
so i was going to vote itl except i was
 
02:11:32.310 --> 02:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
just contacted
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
by someone who believes that the bill is
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
still necessary so i
 
02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
responded to his email i haven't gotten
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
a response back from him um if we itl uh
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
if it does turn out to be necessary and
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
we itl a bill
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately that would mean that we
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't bring the bill back up again
 
02:11:49.350 --> 02:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
next year
 
02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:50.550 align:start position:0%
next year
um

02:11:50.550 --> 02:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple um issue of just a
 
02:11:56.069 --> 02:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
a kind of a repeal so there's no way you
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
can kind of work around that
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
that restriction
 
02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
um and of course the issue is very
 
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
popular on citizens count i think it was
 
02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.950 align:start position:0%
popular on citizens count i think it was
uh

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%

for
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
for bringing growlers with you um so for
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
that reason i would prefer to simply
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
retain the bill just in case um the
 
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
issues are not uh um
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%

representatives secondly
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
use uh to retain
 
02:14:57.510 --> 02:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
416. and representative is recognized to
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
speak to his motion
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chair uh i moved to
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
retain house bill 416
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
i'm one of the co-sponsors uh listed
 
02:15:10.870 --> 02:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
i believe the bill is good intentions
 
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
but it needs some more work
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
the language could be a little clearer
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
it is included in
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%

02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
production of beer and wine for family
 
02:15:28.639 --> 02:15:31.589 align:start position:0%
production of beer and wine for family

02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
it used to be illegal at the federal
 
02:15:33.599 --> 02:15:34.950 align:start position:0%
it used to be illegal at the federal
level

02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.470 align:start position:0%
level
to

02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
make your own wine or beer
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
for your home consumption
 
02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
and it took people at the state level or
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know within states
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
to make that practice popular
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the federal government eventually
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
follows the lead of its citizens
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
i remember as a kid my grandfather would
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
make his own he'd grow his own grapes
 
02:16:02.470 --> 02:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
and make his own wine in the basement
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
and i i couldn't tell you if he was
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
doing it before the prohibition ended
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
but i remember him being happy about the
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
prohibition ending
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh this would add
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
distillation of home liquor
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh not in excess of
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
200 gallons
 
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
if there's more than if there's two or
 
02:16:23.109 --> 02:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
more people in the household per year
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
or 100 gallons
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
if there is only one person in the
 
02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.149 align:start position:0%
if there is only one person in the
household

02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
household
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
and it's only for household use not for
 
02:16:30.159 --> 02:16:31.669 align:start position:0%
and it's only for household use not for
resale

02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
resale
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
home distillation
 
02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:34.230 align:start position:0%
home distillation
uh

02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
the technology for home distillation
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
is uh similar now to
 
02:16:42.469 --> 02:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
remember when bread makers first came
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
out where you could put the ingredients
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
in a machine
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
set a timer and push a button
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
and out i would come a few hours later
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
a warm loaf of bread
 
02:16:56.070 --> 02:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
well home distillation uh technology has
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh gotten very similar those products
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
are available in europe
 
02:17:00.399 --> 02:17:01.669 align:start position:0%
are available in europe
um

02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh that that's one way that people may
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
do home distillation at home i think the
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh the the bill
 
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
needs a little work so i'd move to
 
02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:17.589 align:start position:0%
needs a little work so i'd move to
retain

02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i definitely think
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
this needs work um we've had this kind
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
of issue around for a bit and have never
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
come to a place in which we passed it um
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know i will not disagree with
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative ammon but i i have heard
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
horror stories about home distillation
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
and and dangers that have come from that
 
02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh and so that is a concern for me
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
i realize it's a narrow focus right now
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
with the homeowner the home distillation
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
going on here but it does seem as though
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
it it um it has the potential and i
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to be um too direct about
 
02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
this but it does have the potential to
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
open the door to
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
um back dooring our liquor commission
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
backdooring uh a backbone of our of our
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
economy here in new hampshire
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
and so for a variety of reasons um i i
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
believe that an itl
 
02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:06.230 align:start position:0%
believe that an itl
emotion

02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
emotion
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
would hopefully be brought to bear after
 
02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm i'm much more
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
worried about uh
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
poisonous the poisoning i'm worried that
 
02:18:24.389 --> 02:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
there's no ability to determine what you
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
know what's in the product i'm much more
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
worried about
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
um the fact that 140-150 proof is
 
02:18:30.479 --> 02:18:31.669 align:start position:0%
um the fact that 140-150 proof is
obtainable

02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
obtainable
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm much more worried about there's no
 
02:18:36.309 --> 02:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
testing and no training for
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
homeowners to be doing this on their own
 
02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:40.549 align:start position:0%
homeowners to be doing this on their own
um

02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
there's no monitoring um how
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's just nothing around this
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is not making bread you are not
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
gonna die
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
if you haven't put in all the
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
ingredients or let the bread maker work
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
it work hard enough on this
 
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
distilling liquor is a very different
 
02:18:57.280 --> 02:18:58.389 align:start position:0%
distilling liquor is a very different
process

02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
um and i do not i i cannot support this
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
bill not the retain not not the
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay representative bilo
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i am going to be
 
02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
i do not want to vote to retain it i
 
02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:19.519 align:start position:0%
would like to vote to itl it
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with the word hobby
 
02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:22.950 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with the word hobby
um

02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
for four years um i was on environment
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
and agriculture and
 
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
we were we often
 
02:19:32.549 --> 02:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
discussed hobby breeders now hobby
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
breeders sell their dogs and cats and so
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with hobby because i
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
think eventually they'll be um sales so
 
02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
i am going to i would like to itl this
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
sales would they definitely
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
they would have to be licensed and
 
02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.429 align:start position:0%
they would have to be licensed and
regulated

02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
02:19:53.439 --> 02:19:54.870 align:start position:0%

penn state
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
i was just doing some research on
 
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
article 5 of amending the constitution
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
and the one
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
article or the one
 
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that was passed
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
by state ratifying conventions was
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
ending alcohol prohibition and reading
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
the debate from other states
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
was very enlightening about the
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
many attempts by
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government and state
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
government to try to ban things and in
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
particular ban the distillation of
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
alcohol and ban the creation of beer and
 
02:20:27.359 --> 02:20:28.230 align:start position:0%
alcohol and ban the creation of beer and
wine

02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
wine
 
02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
and all of the problems that came up
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
when you try to make something illegal
 
02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
um i i think that that we were right in
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
1933 to repeal that and change to
 
02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:41.030 align:start position:0%
1933 to repeal that and change to
regulation

02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
um i think that the technology 100 years
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
later certainly is there
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
02:20:46.479 --> 02:20:47.670 align:start position:0%
i think it's
matured

02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
matured
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
for uh having these machines similar to
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
bread makers and microwaves
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
i have a bread maker in my home i have a
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
microwave in my home we have appliances
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
in our home that are thoroughly tested
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
and i would i would say that uh the
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
safety issues have already been been
 
02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:04.550 align:start position:0%
safety issues have already been been
well

02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
solved but i i just feel like banning
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
something like home distillation as a
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
hobby i i feel like that's that's a
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
repeat of prohibition and they were they
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
were pretty clear in 1933 that
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
prohibition was uh was a complete
 
02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:20.790 align:start position:0%
prohibition was uh was a complete
disaster

02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
i guess when you're talking about the
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
concert i was thinking about george
 
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
washington's first crisis was the
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
whiskey rebellion and the attempted
 
02:21:31.030 --> 02:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
attack whiskey
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay that's a good point too okay your

representative patusik moves in
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%

motion
so

02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
i moved itl
 
02:23:59.190 --> 02:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
this again was another bill that i
 
02:24:01.270 --> 02:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
really liked when i first saw it saw the
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
title and then we opened it up and
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
looked at it
 
02:24:08.309 --> 02:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
what the build actually would do though
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
is require that manufacturers
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
sell parts to just absolutely anyone
 
02:24:15.270 --> 02:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't have any control over
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
their own logistics and their own
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the giveaway uh requiring
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
that they give away um
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
tech manuals and material that could
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
include some internal information
 
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
there were safety issues that were
 
02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
from manufacturers and
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
i didn't see anything to counter that
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
but the bill also opens up
 
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
all sorts of issues on regulating
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce and constitutional
 
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
and federal issues and legal issues
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
that i i felt would be a little
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
too difficult to retain and i also felt
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
that the bill had
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh structural issues we can't solve
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
structural issues internally within the
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee so it would have to be sent
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
back for the the sponsors and the
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to work out something
 
02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to work out something
different

02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
and the final problem that i that i saw
 
02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
02:25:04.399 --> 02:25:06.389 align:start position:0%
with the bill
is

02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
that it really hurt the new hampshire
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
advantage that manufacturers who want to
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
sell to new hampshire new hampshire
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
customers they don't have to sell the
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
product in new hampshire so you'd have a
 
02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:16.950 align:start position:0%
product in new hampshire so you'd have a
manufacturer

02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
of appliances or
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know electronics or something
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to sell to new
 
02:25:24.870 --> 02:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire customers but instead of
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
selling them here their only options
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
would be to sell them in vermont maine
 
02:25:32.309 --> 02:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
you know main outlet store and north
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
shore mass and some of the other
 
02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
retailers and then we would lose all of
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
the jobs all of the public and private
 
02:25:40.389 --> 02:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
revenue all of the local revenue and we
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
would lose any ability to control it
 
02:25:44.230 --> 02:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
so certain manufacturers especially
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
foreign manufacturers would have a
 
02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:47.429 align:start position:0%
foreign manufacturers would have a
difficult

02:25:47.429 --> 02:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
time with this and
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
i was trying to you know figure out or
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
estimate what could be the potential
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
revenue loss from enacting this and i
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the rabbit hole once you
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
you know i like the idea but once you
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually try to use the state government
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
to implement it it just started creating
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
more and more problems that that
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't be solved by the committee so i
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
think that it's another one where you
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
have 20 states considering this
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislation this year and you have more
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
states considering it in the previous
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
session and none of them have passed it
 
02:26:20.469 --> 02:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
because they've run into a lot of the
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
with all due respect for
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
to representative abramson
 
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
i think he is is reading things into
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
this bill that
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
in real practice will absolutely not
 
02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:46.469 align:start position:0%
in real practice will absolutely not
happen

02:26:46.469 --> 02:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
we have to remember first of all that
 
02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire having no
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
that many people who live near the
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
border and other states come into
 
02:26:59.910 --> 02:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
our state to buy
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh buy appliances and so forth uh that's
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
not gonna that's not gonna change the
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
second thing about this bill
 
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:08.450 align:start position:0%
second thing about this bill
um

02:27:08.450 --> 02:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
is that this is really friendly
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
to small
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
businesses independent repair people
 
02:27:21.429 --> 02:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh we are helping small businesses
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
by supporting this bill
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
02:27:30.150 --> 02:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
i want to support this bill thank you
 
02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:31.270 align:start position:0%
i want to support this bill thank you
bartlett

02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
bartlett
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm flabbergasted
 
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
that um some from the other side are
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
they want to protect big business
 
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
um not allow repairs this is just for
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
home appliances
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
this bill has been um scaled back
 
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
dramatically from what we've read what
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the past
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
um i think that the small business
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
owners that just want to repair
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
home appliances should be able to do it
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
and they need to be able to access the
 
02:27:57.439 --> 02:27:58.469 align:start position:0%
and they need to be able to access the
information

02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
that the big government is keeping them
 
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
from being able to access
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
so you're going to protect
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
the big manufacturers from the little
 
02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
guys that just want to go out and
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
fix the washing machine or fix you know
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
we were talking last night about a
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
toaster oven well you're probably not
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
going to get fixed that fixed but some
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
of these washing machines and dryers are
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
putting a lot of money into
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
um and you want to be able to just have
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
a local guy repair it you don't have to
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
make an appointment from somebody in
 
02:28:27.750 --> 02:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
manchester that's got to come out three
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
weeks from now in the meantime you
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to use your washing
 
02:28:30.399 --> 02:28:31.429 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to use your washing
machine

02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
machine
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
when many of those fixes are very simple
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
and the small repair shop ought to be
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
able to access it
 
02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:39.349 align:start position:0%
able to access it
so

02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'm definitely opposed to the itl and i
 
02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative terry
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chairman in point of
 
02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:51.270 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chairman in point of
fact

02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
fact
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
many of the manufacturers
 
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
do make
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
the plans and the parts available
 
02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:00.550 align:start position:0%
the plans and the parts available
for

02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
small independent repairs and
 
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
do-it-yourselfers such as myself so i do
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
not see this as a widespread problem
 
02:29:10.469 --> 02:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
whatsoever thank you
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson
 
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
um just a quick um
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
response that you have an absolute legal
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
moral and constitutional right to
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
attempt to repair anything that you want
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
that you own that's your property or to
 
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
to go to any independent repair shop
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
but so
 
02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
you have a right to repair as it is it's
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
not the title of the bill
 
02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
that i'm objecting to it's what the bill
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
actually says and what the bill says is
 
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
if you sell appliances in new hampshire
 
02:29:41.830 --> 02:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
you have this specialized
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
you know front loader
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's very unusual
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of companies make their tech
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
support manuals and parts
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
in such a way
 
02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:54.309 align:start position:0%
in such a way
that

02:29:54.309 --> 02:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
that they can have hands-on training or
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
a specialized training program in person
 
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
where they they instruct people on how
 
02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
to replace certain parts
 
02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
and if you then have to take all these
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
tech manuals
 
02:30:09.270 --> 02:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
especially for a small manufacturer that
 
02:30:11.590 --> 02:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
only produces a few specialized items it
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be really difficult or maybe even
 
02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
impossible for them
 
02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:16.309 align:start position:0%
impossible for them
to

02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
rewrite all of their tech support
 
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
manuals and remanufacture all their
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
parts and include
 
02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
additional inserts for all their parts
 
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
so that people could do it yourself in
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
your home or for people who have no
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
training or for independent repair shops
 
02:30:30.790 --> 02:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
i have several independent repair shops
 
02:30:32.469 --> 02:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
just in walking distance of me here in
 
02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
seabrook and we're right on the border
 
02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:36.150 align:start position:0%
seabrook and we're right on the border
so

02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
one it's it's a takings and two it's a
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's a mandate and it's i hear members
 
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
from the other side saying oh big
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers but usually when we're
 
02:30:47.349 --> 02:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
talking about companies that make very
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
specialized parts
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
um they're
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
the more specialized they are um small
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
businesses tend to focus in
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
in in very small niche markets i know
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
that there are companies like apple and
 
02:31:01.830 --> 02:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
samsung that make
 
02:31:03.429 --> 02:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
specialized parts too they're
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar giants but
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
um if some new startup wants to come up
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
with a new type of small engine or a new
 
02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
type of rotary engine or a new type of
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
battery or something like that that
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't have user serviceable parts
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
their only solution if they're if
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
they're trying to sell those products is
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
they couldn't sell them in new hampshire
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
and so i saw this as for those types of
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
companies the only recourse they would
 
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
have it would be to sell them in other
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh so next up is representative bartlett
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this bill is very
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
specific about what a home appliance is
 
02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's not talking about specialized small
 
02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.830 align:start position:0%
it's not talking about specialized small
manufactured

02:31:43.830 --> 02:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured
 
02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
types of products
 
02:31:45.680 --> 02:31:46.790 align:start position:0%
types of products
i

02:31:46.790 --> 02:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:31:48.389 --> 02:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
would challenge you to find a small
 
02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that this would apply to
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
these are large manufacturers home
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
appliances include
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
cleaning cooking or food preservation
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
air conditioners dishwashers clothes and
 
02:32:02.710 --> 02:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
washers washers dryers freezers
 
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
refrigerators kitchen ovens these are
 
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
made by large manufacturers
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
and if they if a small repair shop
 
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
cannot get a handbook or cannot get a
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
password they will be restraining their
 
02:32:18.469 --> 02:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
their trade from being able to
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
access it and again i'm very surprised
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
that the other side
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
is making it more difficult for
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
small businesses to be able to go out
 
02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
there and repair and protecting
 
02:32:34.950 --> 02:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um just to the to the
 
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
argument that the manufacturers are
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to rewrite their manuals i
 
02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
would venture to assert that um people
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
who are skilled in uh
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
the repair of these appliances
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
um are not going to find those manuals
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
to be rocket science and that they'll be
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
able to utilize these to fix the parts
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
and if they can't they can always tell
 
02:33:05.349 --> 02:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
the consumer um this is beyond what we
 
02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
can do right now but again my guess is
 
02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
these people do this for a living
 
02:33:11.750 --> 02:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're used to using these manuals and
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
and most of them should be able to do
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:18.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:21.910 --> 02:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
um uh obviously in past years uh the
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
legislation seen the people who came in
 
02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
and testified and supported it was the
 
02:33:29.670 --> 02:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
computers and phones and you know what i
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
would call the hype
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know type things but this bill
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't include any of that right this
 
02:33:38.950 --> 02:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
bill simply goes uh to the more uh more
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
mundane appliance
 
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
than that but
 
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day my argument
 
02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
against this bill is the exact same
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
argument against i had that bill and
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
that is does the right of the
 
02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.510 align:start position:0%
that is does the right of the
manufacturer

02:33:51.510 --> 02:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
choose who he wants or she wants to
 
02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
service their equipment
 
02:33:59.429 --> 02:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
that is it their right to decide that
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
they don't want some unauthorized
 
02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
um somebody who you know with with a i
 
02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:06.870 align:start position:0%
um somebody who you know with with a i
guess

02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
guess
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
an appliance shop
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to service these type of
 
02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
equipment and um when it comes to
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
modern modern-day equipments they are
 
02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
very sophisticated computers and
 
02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:19.510 align:start position:0%
very sophisticated computers and
electronics

02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
electronics
 
02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
and that they have you know maybe they
 
02:34:22.870 --> 02:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
have a very strict procedure about how
 
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
you take the thing apart and they don't
 
02:34:27.270 --> 02:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
really want anybody who isn't an
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
authorized service tech mucking around
 
02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
because if they mix up something else
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
they could make do more damage than they
 
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
were they could it would have done and
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
and you know the manufacturer might be
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
stuck having to replace parts that they
 
02:34:42.630 --> 02:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have had to replace because it
 
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
was an unauthorized service tech who
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
took it apart so uh it's the same same
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
issue i've always had is that um i think
 
02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have a right to decide who
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
they uh want to sell parts to who they
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
want to give manuals to and who they
 
02:34:59.670 --> 02:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
want to be servicing their equipment and
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
i've never heard anybody you know worry
 
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:02.630 align:start position:0%
i've never heard anybody you know worry
about

02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
um you know they're saying oh boy i got
 
02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
a zero refrigerator that cost me three
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars much like a computer
 
02:35:10.469 --> 02:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
that i want to bring it to any joe
 
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
schmoe to have it fixed um i think you
 
02:35:15.190 --> 02:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
you're more apt to call the authorized
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
service center anyway so so this i
 
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
really think this legislation is
 
02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:20.870 align:start position:0%
really think this legislation is
unnecessary

02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh who's up first
 
02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:40.389 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:35:40.389 --> 02:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:35:44.469 --> 02:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
i i understand your reasoning in terms
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
of being able to have to choose
 
02:35:51.590 --> 02:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
who can buy their stuff
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
but i'm uh
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm uh
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for me to imagine that
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's how the system works in any way
 
02:36:03.750 --> 02:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
shape or form because once i buy it it's
 
02:36:06.389 --> 02:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
mine exactly not
 
02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
and so if i if i want to go and have
 
02:36:11.190 --> 02:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
somebody make a repair and i'm confident
 
02:36:13.270 --> 02:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
that they're good at that that's my
 
02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:14.309 align:start position:0%
that they're good at that that's my
choice

02:36:14.309 --> 02:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
choice
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh so um
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of the bill and and for
 
02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
that reason uh
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
and i know somebody's competent uh and i
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
take it to a garage
 
02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
and i have a competent garage that i go
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
and and never had a problem so
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
so uh so it's uh i think i think i i'm
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
in the favor of you know these people
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
are good at what they do they make a
 
02:36:52.230 --> 02:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh control uh over the the product
 
02:36:57.990 --> 02:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
and uh i i don't think that they have a
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
right to do that
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:37:03.190 --> 02:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's it i'm you know i'm not gonna
 
02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's my vote's gonna be in that regard
 
02:37:08.309 --> 02:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
and and uh go ahead representative
 
02:37:08.319 --> 02:37:09.830 align:start position:0%
and and uh go ahead representative
abramson

02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
abramson
 
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
so i should have mentioned this before i
 
02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
i write embedded software
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
um i went to rensselaer to study
 
02:37:18.389 --> 02:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
electrical engineering on how to build
 
02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
and develop hardware like this
 
02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
i had a housemate who worked in
 
02:37:25.270 --> 02:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
appliances and he was really good at
 
02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:26.389 align:start position:0%
appliances and he was really good at
repairing

02:37:26.389 --> 02:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
repairing
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know basic mechanical things and he
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
could fix 90 percent of the problems
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
even in
 
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
something that's very specialized but
 
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
the just the clock the control unit in
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
in the gas oven
 
02:37:38.479 --> 02:37:40.230 align:start position:0%
in the gas oven
um

02:37:40.230 --> 02:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
the the that that component may be made
 
02:37:46.150 --> 02:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
by a small company that then sells the
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
ge or maytag or one of the big
 
02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:50.150 align:start position:0%
ge or maytag or one of the big
manufacturers

02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
the the cpu the microprocessors are
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
getting much more complicated they're
 
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
far more just the embedded processors
 
02:37:58.870 --> 02:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
inside your smartphones
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
the 64-bit arm i was going to write a a
 
02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
a tech book on that
 
02:38:03.439 --> 02:38:04.550 align:start position:0%
a tech book on that
and

02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:07.270 --> 02:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
the the complexity of the cmd extensions
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
the 64-bit uh memory mapping i mean i
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't even begin to explain
 
02:38:15.110 --> 02:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
how to
 
02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:16.070 align:start position:0%
how to
i

02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:38:19.270 --> 02:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know update the uh the flash memory
 
02:38:21.910 --> 02:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
um or do device driver updates for my
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
friend who does nothing but repairing
 
02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
appliances my housemate who does nothing
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
but repairing appliances and and some of
 
02:38:28.950 --> 02:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
these shops in seabrook are really good
 
02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
but when they get into the really
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
complicated technical issues they're
 
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
smart enough to say
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're not going to get into
 
02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
this you need you'd need a a an
 
02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
electrical engineer with a four-year d
 
02:38:41.349 --> 02:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:38:43.030 --> 02:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
with tools that we don't have in order
 
02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
to to break down the electronics on this
 
02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
and try and reprogram or update it or
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
calibrate the the sensors for for these
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
these appliances they're the independent
 
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
shops are smart enough to know not to
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
even attempt to do that and
 
02:38:57.040 --> 02:38:57.910 align:start position:0%
even attempt to do that and
for

02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know for cars for the ecu units and
 
02:39:02.070 --> 02:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
whatnot we wouldn't we wouldn't think of
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
having the abs system for a car
 
02:39:08.550 --> 02:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
be reprogrammed by a regular local shop
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
they would send that to the dealership
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
the dealership has very very expensive
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
equipment that they use just for
 
02:39:17.670 --> 02:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
reprogramming ecu's well a gas stove
 
02:39:21.030 --> 02:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
has just as much uh potential for a
 
02:39:24.870 --> 02:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
hazard for fire explosion if if the uh
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
the ecu if the
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
the microcontroller if the if the
 
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
computer unit for that
 
02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh fails
 
02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:32.870 align:start position:0%
uh fails
um

02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
you know there are real safety issues
 
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
and if
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
for some of these engineers making these
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
specialized control units um
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
for their own sensors for their own
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
devices for their own uh control servos
 
02:39:49.750 --> 02:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
if you if you don't understand what
 
02:39:52.150 --> 02:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
you're doing it does all the bill does
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
is it tells the company that they now
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
have to rewrite all their tech manuals
 
02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
their videos and everything else for
 
02:39:59.670 --> 02:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
people whom they haven't trained
 
02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:00.630 align:start position:0%
people whom they haven't trained
um

02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
i i i just i just can't see mandating
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
this i just see too many problems
 
02:40:06.870 --> 02:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
legal problems and safety issues coming
 
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
up trying to mandate this a lot of
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
all right i i think we
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
beat this horse dead
 
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh is the
 
02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
question clear the motion is to in
 
02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
expanding the legislating house bill
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
449. the clerk will call the roll
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
and before i do uh one little tip for
 
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
zoom if you hold down the space bar
 
02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh while you're talking and let go it'll
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
it'll temporarily unmute you so
 
02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative patusik
 
02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:37.830 align:start position:0%

representative osborne
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes but your trick doesn't work on my
 
02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:43.349 align:start position:0%
yes but your trick doesn't work on my
device

02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
device
 
02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:45.840 align:start position:0%

02:41:43.990 --> 02:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'll do the minority report on that one
 
02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:47.990 align:start position:0%
i'll do the minority report on that one
okay

02:41:47.990 --> 02:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
all right mr chairman
 
02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:51.429 align:start position:0%
all right mr chairman
yes

02:41:51.429 --> 02:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:41:53.349 --> 02:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
i just want to let you know i have class
 
02:41:55.830 --> 02:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
at 12. um i'm just gonna pull it up on
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
zoom so i'll be in two things at once so
 
02:41:59.910 --> 02:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
if you see me talking to somebody it'll
 
02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
just be
 
02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
my other class so this won't be surgery
 
02:42:04.950 --> 02:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
where you're trying to have a i said
 
02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
that on tv
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
one on my phone and then just do one on
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
my computer so then i have both going
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh okay okay you're st you're at home
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
right you're you're not going to class
 
02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:27.190 align:start position:0%
right you're you're not going to class
okay

02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
um i i guess i guess we can we'll do
 
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
this i mean i um
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing pretty well here we got
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of it done you know so but i
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
guess if we'll keep going um
 
02:42:41.590 --> 02:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
until people are had enough
 
02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:42.790 align:start position:0%
until people are had enough
okay

02:42:42.790 --> 02:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh so next up is house bill 451
 
02:42:49.270 --> 02:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
auto insurance limits uh representative
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
terry seconded by representative patusek
 
02:42:51.359 --> 02:42:52.309 align:start position:0%
terry seconded by representative patusek
moves

02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
moves
 
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate and represent

terry is recognized to speak to his
 
02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.870 align:start position:0%
terry is recognized to speak to his
motion

02:42:58.870 --> 02:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman is this bill amended i
 
02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
see an amendment from
 
02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative infantine what do we do
 
02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
anything with that no because okay
 
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion is we're going to do
 
02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
amendments we're going to delve into all
 
02:43:13.349 --> 02:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't want to do that
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you then then i'm all set to go
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and honored colleagues
 
02:43:21.750 --> 02:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
at first blush this bill appears to be
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
seeking a reasonable increase in minimum
 
02:43:26.469 --> 02:43:26.479 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle insurance limits however
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
we heard compelling testimony that in
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
fact the likely effect of enacting this
 
02:43:31.830 --> 02:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill would discourage drivers from
 
02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
obtaining or keeping auto insurance
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
because the increased minimum coverages
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
would provoke higher premiums
 
02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
at a time when scores of our state's
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
residents are struggling to find or
 
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
retain gainful employment
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
and gasoline prices are rising
 
02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
dramatically this is not the time to
 
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
mandate an additional increase to the
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
cost of driving
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
and finally mr chairman i find it deeply
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
troubling that this bill's sole sponsor
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
is employed in the insurance industry
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
and potentially stands to gain
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
financially from the passage of this
 
02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
bill i move itl
 
02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
jesus okay
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson has his hand
 
02:44:09.359 --> 02:44:10.230 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson has his hand
up

02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:44:12.469 --> 02:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make the point that uh
 
02:44:15.030 --> 02:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
if if we wanted to inflation adjust it
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
um that
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
um while i agree with the itl motion uh
 
02:44:21.429 --> 02:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment would just change it from
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
25 50 25 to 30 60 30 so it would um i
 
02:44:27.429 --> 02:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
didn't have a problem with the amended
 
02:44:27.439 --> 02:44:28.550 align:start position:0%
didn't have a problem with the amended
version

02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
version
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
but i i do have a problem that we're
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
trying to get people into insurance get
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
people into auto insurance who currently
 
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't have it
 
02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i i've
 
02:44:39.670 --> 02:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
felt that maybe we should even lower the
 
02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:41.510 align:start position:0%
felt that maybe we should even lower the
minimums

02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
minimums
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
because we want uh auto insurance to be
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
as affordable as possible especially for
 
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
people who haven't had it in a while
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor wasn't real
 
02:44:52.469 --> 02:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
um i didn't i didn't
 
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh i didn't think that there was a
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh because uh they know that if they did
 
02:44:59.429 --> 02:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
double the
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
the minimums that they would sell fewer
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
new insurance policies so he might
 
02:45:03.439 --> 02:45:04.469 align:start position:0%
new insurance policies so he might
actually

02:45:04.469 --> 02:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
um he wasn't enthusiastic about the bill
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
because he might actually lose some
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative bartlett thank
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
you very much mr chair
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
this is one hit the wrong button it's
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:27.429 --> 02:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
this is one that
 
02:45:29.750 --> 02:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
with my background i have got to support
 
02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about at least 40 years
 
02:45:34.230 --> 02:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
according to the insurance department
 
02:45:35.510 --> 02:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
since these
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
minimums were raised now 40 years ago
 
02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
a 2550
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh 25 policy
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
would have paid for a lot of claims
 
02:45:48.309 --> 02:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
most claims are small
 
02:45:48.319 --> 02:45:49.190 align:start position:0%
most claims are small
but

02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
when these limits haven't gone up
 
02:45:54.230 --> 02:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
and the and claims that do come in are
 
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
much higher than they were you'll end up
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
paying a total much more often so the
 
02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
rates do go up that's the way rate
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
making works
 
02:46:05.349 --> 02:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
um the examples that uh representative
 
02:46:07.750 --> 02:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
infantine gave us who's the sponsor on
 
02:46:10.469 --> 02:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
this showed that maybe a 17 year old's
 
02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
paying four thousand dollars now he's
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
only gonna pay another three hundred
 
02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
dollars well by the time he's paid four
 
02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
thousand three hundred isn't a whole lot
 
02:46:21.750 --> 02:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
and for the other people that are
 
02:46:23.349 --> 02:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
wait i mean if you already got four
 
02:46:24.870 --> 02:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:46:27.429 --> 02:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
that you're paying 300 is not a huge
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
increase on that
 
02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:30.230 align:start position:0%
increase on that
however

02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:32.150 align:start position:0%
however
um

02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
or you know people that are more average
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
drivers to increase
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
to a um
 
02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit higher is is only about a
 
02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars more
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
um i'm i am also the one who spoke on
 
02:46:48.630 --> 02:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
the floor last year when well i guess it
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
was the year before now um
 
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about our new
 
02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire being the only
 
02:46:54.640 --> 02:46:55.510 align:start position:0%
hampshire being the only
state

02:46:55.510 --> 02:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:46:57.510 --> 02:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
that does not have mandatory auto
 
02:46:57.520 --> 02:46:58.630 align:start position:0%
that does not have mandatory auto
insurance

02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
auto insurance really has become social
 
02:47:03.670 --> 02:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
insurance much more like workers comp
 
02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:04.710 align:start position:0%
insurance much more like workers comp
um

02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
because everybody drives
 
02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
we have we've had in the past hours and
 
02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
hours of testimony about
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
um what it's like to be hit by an
 
02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
uninsured driver and our uninsured rates
 
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
have gone up dramatically over the last
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
decade because so many
 
02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
and are at fault in an accident your
 
02:47:31.349 --> 02:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
policy lands up paying and the way that
 
02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
you pay for that is all everybody that's
 
02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
got an insurance policy
 
02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
pays into that pool
 
02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
um i you know i have a pretty good idea
 
02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna lose on this one
 
02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
but this is one of my principled stands
 
02:47:47.110 --> 02:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:48.389 align:start position:0%
that's all
okay

02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:47:51.110 --> 02:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i want to say that our
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
illustrious my uh committee minority
 
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
leader uh ranking member excuse me
 
02:48:03.670 --> 02:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
ranking member uh
 
02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
said exactly what i was going to say um
 
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
and so i i certainly support her
 
02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:10.870 align:start position:0%
and so i i certainly support her
position

02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:12.630 align:start position:0%
position
that

02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
keeping these uh minimums as low as they
 
02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
are is just rate it's just keeping up
 
02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
our uninsured and underinsured motorist
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
part of our of
 
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
our policies
 
02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
higher than it ought to be so i i agree
 
02:48:36.870 --> 02:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay i kind of missed that one but
 
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
um i i would have to say i was surprised
 
02:48:43.750 --> 02:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
to see how many states that actually
 
02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:44.389 align:start position:0%
to see how many states that actually
were

02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
their minimums were even lower than ours
 
02:48:49.670 --> 02:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
i was uh kind of awestruck that kind of
 
02:48:51.510 --> 02:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
scary when you when you drive in those
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
other states and realize that oh great
 
02:48:55.429 --> 02:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
we got they have mandatory auto
 
02:48:57.670 --> 02:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
insurance but the limits were so low
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't seem like it really
 
02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
matters but at the end of the day i
 
02:49:03.590 --> 02:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
would hope that every
 
02:49:06.389 --> 02:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
auto insurance salesman knows you need
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
to sell it up you need to move the
 
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
customer up need to get higher rates um
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
and for those of us who want to have an
 
02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:16.469 align:start position:0%
and for those of us who want to have an
umbrella

02:49:16.469 --> 02:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
umbrella
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're we're at the top anyway so it
 
02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect us
 
02:49:21.910 --> 02:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
and um i think that the fact that we
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
have a very well insured market we have
 
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
people who can make choices and decide
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
what are the right limits for themselves
 
02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:29.190 align:start position:0%
what are the right limits for themselves
and

02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think that that
 
02:49:34.309 --> 02:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
our auto insurance market is does not
 
02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
need to be disrupted with changing this
 
02:49:38.230 --> 02:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
and and we've already had a bad
 
02:49:40.389 --> 02:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
experience once when many years ago when
 
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
we tried to change the
 
02:49:45.269 --> 02:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
the med pay and and uh and i could i
 
02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
can't tell you that that bill was
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
repealed faster than than campgrounds
 
02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:51.910 align:start position:0%
repealed faster than than campgrounds
so

02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:54.230 --> 02:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
when we tried the tax campaign so uh to
 
02:49:56.309 --> 02:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
me changing these rates would it would
 
02:49:59.349 --> 02:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
only be disruptive to the marketplace
 
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:01.840 align:start position:0%

02:59:47.349 --> 02:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
um so so joe what did you say your class
 
02:59:49.190 --> 02:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
schedule didn't drop my mind i know i
 
02:59:51.030 --> 02:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
must have it written down somewhere
 
02:59:53.030 --> 02:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
was your
 
02:59:54.710 --> 02:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what was that what was your
 
02:59:57.269 --> 02:59:57.279 align:start position:0%
class schedule again um for today so i
 
02:59:59.429 --> 02:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
have this class ends at 1 15 and then i
 
03:00:02.389 --> 03:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
have another class at 2 to 3 15.
 
03:00:02.399 --> 03:00:03.830 align:start position:0%
have another class at 2 to 3 15.
okay

03:00:03.830 --> 03:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:00:05.110 --> 03:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
sure if you're ready to go on this bill
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
right now i'm ready but if you want to
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
hold it over that's fine
 
03:00:10.309 --> 03:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
let's just do this one let's do this
 
03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
make this through
 
03:00:11.760 --> 03:00:13.429 align:start position:0%
make this through
okay

03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:00:13.439 --> 03:00:14.550 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:00:16.230 --> 03:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this bill should be
 
03:00:18.790 --> 03:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
itl for two reasons
 
03:00:20.550 --> 03:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh first it would address a problem
 
03:00:22.469 --> 03:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
whose magnitude and frequency have not
 
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
been established as well as to presume
 
03:00:26.950 --> 03:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
internet service providers egregious
 
03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
failures to address service outages
 
03:00:31.750 --> 03:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriately or not at all
 
03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
second the bill requires that internet
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
service providers be responsible for
 
03:00:37.349 --> 03:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
determining both who is responsible for
 
03:00:40.469 --> 03:00:40.479 align:start position:0%
customers out of service statuses
 
03:00:43.110 --> 03:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
and then precisely how long each
 
03:00:45.670 --> 03:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
of the service time lasted out of
 
03:00:47.510 --> 03:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
service time lasted
 
03:00:49.750 --> 03:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
that can be attributed with certainty to
 
03:00:51.830 --> 03:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
the service provider
 
03:00:53.670 --> 03:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
then third and with respect to the
 
03:00:56.230 --> 03:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
bill's provisions penalizing isps for
 
03:00:58.790 --> 03:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
not meeting advertised speeds
 
03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
it must be recognized that isps make
 
03:01:03.429 --> 03:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
clear that there are variable factors
 
03:01:05.750 --> 03:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
that affect each customer's upload and
 
03:01:07.349 --> 03:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
download speeds
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
not the least of which are factors that
 
03:01:11.830 --> 03:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
are not the responsibility of the of any
 
03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:13.429 align:start position:0%
are not the responsibility of the of any
isp

03:01:13.429 --> 03:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
isp
 
03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
such factors include the number and
 
03:01:17.349 --> 03:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
types of customer devices utilizing
 
03:01:19.670 --> 03:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
bandwidth at any given time
 
03:01:21.990 --> 03:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
and the fact that internal wiring is
 
03:01:24.389 --> 03:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
neither owned by nor the responsibility
 
03:01:26.070 --> 03:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
of the isp
 
03:01:27.910 --> 03:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
in summary this bill would introduce
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
onerous and unjustified government
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
regulation in a type of commerce
 
03:01:34.950 --> 03:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
that while not as yet widely available
 
03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
in modern high-speed modes as we would
 
03:01:39.670 --> 03:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
like is nevertheless not guilty
 
03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the offenses this bill wishes to
 
03:01:44.950 --> 03:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
remedy by its draconian unjustified and
 
03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
unworkable standards and requirements
 
03:01:50.309 --> 03:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:53.190 --> 03:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson
 
03:01:55.590 --> 03:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
um i agree with the itl motion
 
03:01:57.190 --> 03:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
um i
 
03:01:59.110 --> 03:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
so i disagree i certainly think that
 
03:02:00.870 --> 03:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
this is a serious problem and it
 
03:02:02.309 --> 03:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
certainly is in seabrook where i live
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
where we have uh internet outages um
 
03:02:06.950 --> 03:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
quite frequently um even though we're
 
03:02:09.030 --> 03:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
paying a top dollar for service but i
 
03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
believe that the solution is to open up
 
03:02:12.870 --> 03:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
internet service providers to
 
03:02:12.880 --> 03:02:14.230 align:start position:0%
internet service providers to
competition

03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
competition
 
03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:15.190 align:start position:0%
competition
um

03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
that that would benefit consumers more
 
03:02:19.110 --> 03:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
and it would benefit businesses more
 
03:02:20.790 --> 03:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
especially those in tech support and
 
03:02:22.230 --> 03:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
businesses that need
 
03:02:24.870 --> 03:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh teleconferencing and telepresence and
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
other things things that require 100
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
uptime um
 
03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:30.389 align:start position:0%
uptime um
so

03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:02:32.309 --> 03:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
but trying to change this this bill as
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
structural problems trying to change
 
03:02:35.429 --> 03:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
this bill into something completely
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
different um it might even end up going
 
03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
in front of a different committee would
 
03:02:40.950 --> 03:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
not something we can do internally we
 
03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
have to send the issue back to the
 
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors and stakeholders for for change
 
03:02:50.309 --> 03:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:52.230 --> 03:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on the motion
 
03:02:54.389 --> 03:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
of any speeding to legislate seeing none
 
03:02:58.790 --> 03:02:58.800 align:start position:0%

03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh make it effective upon passage but
 
03:05:10.389 --> 03:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
also to put a two-year sunset clause in
 
03:05:12.630 --> 03:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
so that um we'll see you know we it
 
03:05:14.070 --> 03:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
would hopefully help these small
 
03:05:15.750 --> 03:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants right away but then you can
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
see and take a look at it afterwards to
 
03:05:20.230 --> 03:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
see whether um it needs to continue
 
03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and i agree with this concept
 
03:05:24.150 --> 03:05:24.160 align:start position:0%

04:08:55.750 --> 04:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
but i really hope we can help these
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
small restaurants yeah
 
04:09:02.469 --> 04:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
like i said i talked to some of the
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
local folks in derry and they're having
 
04:09:07.990 --> 04:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
the same problem yeah
 
04:09:09.910 --> 04:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
and you know these are these are my
 
04:09:12.150 --> 04:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
neighbors these are my friends
 
04:09:13.269 --> 04:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
but you know i
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have had any idea we don't
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
use delivery from restaurants but um i
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any idea that they didn't
 
04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
have to have a contract
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they take the tips too
 
04:09:25.590 --> 04:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
bothered me
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
right there so the restaurant i work for
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
a couple nights a week we've had this
 
04:09:34.870 --> 04:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
happen to us so i talked to the owner
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
you know and her thoughts and and
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
because we've had people call up and say
 
04:09:40.870 --> 04:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know where's my order i'm like we we
 
04:09:42.870 --> 04:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
don't know what you're talking about
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so you know this amendment and and
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is something that's definitely
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
needed because i didn't realize either
 
04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
because you need and i didn't know
 
04:09:54.150 --> 04:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
anything about it until you know we got
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
here so this is one that is definitely
 
04:09:57.520 --> 04:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
here so this is one that is definitely
needed

04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
could you send me a copy of that
 
04:10:05.439 --> 04:10:06.950 align:start position:0%
could you send me a copy of that
amendment

04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
of course i'm sorry pam
 
04:10:11.990 --> 04:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's why we put a sunset date on it if
 
04:10:13.990 --> 04:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees that it's like a
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
terrible thing why why why are we
 
04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
putting a sunset on it
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
gives us another session
 
04:10:23.269 --> 04:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
um well because
 
04:10:24.870 --> 04:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't understand the full
 
04:10:27.429 --> 04:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
consequence of this and frankly i really
 
04:10:28.870 --> 04:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
do believe it's the response
 
04:10:30.870 --> 04:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility on their own web page to
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
let people know
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
whether they have a contract or not
 
04:10:35.040 --> 04:10:36.229 align:start position:0%
whether they have a contract or not
um

04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:36.239 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
that

04:10:37.080 --> 04:10:37.090 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:37.090 --> 04:10:43.110 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

04:10:43.110 --> 04:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:43.120 --> 04:10:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:10:44.070 --> 04:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:10:45.990 --> 04:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
agree with you on that but the problem
 
04:11:04.870 --> 04:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:14.469 --> 04:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:14.479 --> 04:11:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:11:15.510 --> 04:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:15.520 --> 04:11:17.269 align:start position:0%
um
representative

04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:11:33.110 --> 04:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:37.189 --> 04:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay are we still echoing um no no
 
04:11:37.199 --> 04:11:38.229 align:start position:0%
okay are we still echoing um no no
um

04:11:38.229 --> 04:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative abramson says that we
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
can't do a
 
04:11:41.520 --> 04:11:43.830 align:start position:0%
can't do a
um

04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we we talked about
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
about 60 days it has to it can't be upon
 
04:11:51.030 --> 04:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
passage it has to be a 60 day
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
because the new hampshire
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court and i
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
think it's state law it might even be
 
04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
house rules also that you can't have a
 
04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
new law take effect upon passage we have
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
an enrollment period for one and you
 
04:12:02.000 --> 04:12:02.790 align:start position:0%
an enrollment period for one and you
have

04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
where you have laws that might conflict
 
04:12:06.550 --> 04:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
with other laws
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
or bills that might conflict with other
 
04:12:07.920 --> 04:12:09.189 align:start position:0%
or bills that might conflict with other
bills

04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
going through the house and senate
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
but i just
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
emailed legislative services and saw if
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
i could get a 60-day
 
04:12:18.870 --> 04:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know delay for this takes effect
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of passage
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
so um i've covered this
 
04:12:26.469 --> 04:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
issue before and um there is a actual
 
04:12:28.950 --> 04:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
statute an rsa that says
 
04:12:30.389 --> 04:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
the type of legislation
 
04:12:32.150 --> 04:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
and what the effective dates are
 
04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's when bills come out of
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
legislative services they're going to
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
have all those numbers on it but we're
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature so we can do whatever we
 
04:12:41.760 --> 04:12:43.189 align:start position:0%
the legislature so we can do whatever we
want

04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
and we want to be effective upon passage
 
04:12:48.550 --> 04:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
04:12:48.560 --> 04:12:49.429 align:start position:0%
that's right
now

04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
if there is somebody who says there's a
 
04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
problem with it or something like that
 
04:12:55.510 --> 04:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
they can take it up in the senate but i
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
i've been down this path before max and
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that if we want to say
 
04:13:02.950 --> 04:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
upon passage we can say upon passage
 
04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's
 
04:13:06.550 --> 04:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
i think that that's bad practice on top
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
of that if it's a new penalty if it's a
 
04:13:10.229 --> 04:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
repeal it's different but the new
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court has said if you
 
04:13:13.750 --> 04:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
repeal something then the repeal takes
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
effect immediately or a reduction in
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
penalty takes effect immediately
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
but this is a new penalty this is a new
 
04:13:18.960 --> 04:13:21.990 align:start position:0%
but this is a new penalty this is a new
rule

04:13:21.990 --> 04:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
max i do have an amendment in for 60
 
04:13:25.670 --> 04:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
days by the way that was the original
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
amendment up to but i don't know um
 
04:13:34.469 --> 04:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
so pam i i hate to do this yesterday
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
research on did the supreme court really
 
04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
order that we can't do that
 
04:13:41.110 --> 04:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
well it's on criminal law so that was
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
the research i was doing
 
04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
so it might be different because the
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
judiciary has to update all their forms
 
04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
so they'd like to have things take
 
04:13:50.399 --> 04:13:51.510 align:start position:0%
so they'd like to have things take
effect

04:13:51.510 --> 04:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:13:53.110 --> 04:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
january first of the next year to give
 
04:13:54.309 --> 04:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
them enough time to change all their
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
forms but you're still going to have
 
04:14:00.309 --> 04:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
no i think this is private right of
 
04:14:02.239 --> 04:14:04.630 align:start position:0%
no i think this is private right of
action

04:14:04.630 --> 04:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
i need to pull the bill up but i don't
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
remember this being a criminal
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
but that would even if it's private
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
right of action it's still going through
 
04:14:14.469 --> 04:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
civil war private right to
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.110 --> 04:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
i will
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
see what i can find out so this was a
 
04:14:21.120 --> 04:14:22.389 align:start position:0%
see what i can find out so this was a
recent

04:14:22.389 --> 04:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
recent
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire supreme court decision
 
04:14:26.950 --> 04:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative abramson oh
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
that was uh before even the savings
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
clause this is um
 
04:14:33.429 --> 04:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
i want to say 2001 that that's a
 
04:14:35.670 --> 04:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
criminal case so they they may not it
 
04:14:38.309 --> 04:14:38.319 align:start position:0%
may not apply here
 
04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
tons it doesn't you're adding a new law
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
you're adding a new penalty
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
um we've usually allowed
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
just a certain amount of time to make
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
sure that you're i think i want to
 
04:14:49.269 --> 04:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
require someone to do something that
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
they can't do okay i would say in
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
defense of this statute and and i'm not
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
a lawyer nor do i pretend to be one the
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
defense of the statute is what um these
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
doordash what they're doing is already
 
04:15:05.110 --> 04:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
the court has already ruled in favor of
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
the restaurants
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
for just this issue
 
04:15:08.319 --> 04:15:09.110 align:start position:0%
for just this issue
so

04:15:09.110 --> 04:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is um this is president when i got
 
04:15:15.030 --> 04:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
used to you you know last year
 
04:15:16.469 --> 04:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh parliament williams would keep
 
04:15:19.030 --> 04:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
telling me this is this is uh belts and
 
04:15:19.040 --> 04:15:20.389 align:start position:0%
telling me this is this is uh belts and
suspenders

04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
suspenders
 
04:15:23.910 --> 04:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
because we're actually reinforcing a
 
04:15:27.750 --> 04:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
case law that's already occurred
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
because this was the one that um the
 
04:15:32.790 --> 04:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
owner of the t-bones um tom boucher
 
04:15:35.590 --> 04:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
he had the wherewithal to be able to sue
 
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
and he won
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
but this but it was only for
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
his case
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why this was brought
 
04:15:45.030 --> 04:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
04:15:47.110 --> 04:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
it'll you know the we have the testimony
 
04:15:48.550 --> 04:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
from the small restaurant owners that
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
are being affected too right
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
04:15:51.760 --> 04:15:54.229 align:start position:0%
and there's
then

04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.590 --> 04:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
at any rate that's the reason why we're
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
sun setting so we could revisit it again
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.229 --> 04:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
you know and to be fair i mean we we
 
04:16:05.750 --> 04:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
discuss this and
 
04:16:07.830 --> 04:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
we want to help the restaurants we want
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
this to go through
 
04:16:11.189 --> 04:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
we probably should be talking about this
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
when we're
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's true too part three of the bill
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
any food delivery platform that violates
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
this chapter shall be guilty of a
 
04:16:21.429 --> 04:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
violation and find one hundred dollars
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
for each delivery made without the
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
agreement required in paragraph two
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
okay you're right so i i i
 
04:16:30.309 --> 04:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure if 60 days
 
04:16:31.830 --> 04:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
somebody might uh
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
change it again in the senate they might
 
04:16:35.030 --> 04:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
say jen you go back to the original
 
04:16:36.710 --> 04:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
january 1st
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
if it makes you happy
 
04:16:41.110 --> 04:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
you can certainly then take up
 
04:16:43.269 --> 04:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
connie's amendment after we passed that
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
amendment which then would take it back
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
to 60 days
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
nothing makes me happy my m3 is not
 
04:16:49.359 --> 04:16:50.710 align:start position:0%
nothing makes me happy my m3 is not
running

04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
running
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
just saying
 
04:16:55.110 --> 04:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
i always thought the legislature can can
 
04:16:55.120 --> 04:16:56.070 align:start position:0%
i always thought the legislature can can
and

04:16:56.070 --> 04:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:58.229 --> 04:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
repeal its own law you know you know no
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
legislature can uh
 
04:17:00.239 --> 04:17:01.830 align:start position:0%
legislature can uh
uh

04:17:01.830 --> 04:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
supersede a future legislature so i
 
04:17:04.080 --> 04:17:05.189 align:start position:0%
supersede a future legislature so i
always

04:17:05.189 --> 04:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
always
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
change our
 
04:17:14.309 --> 04:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
let's get going
 
04:17:17.590 --> 04:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
04:17:21.750 --> 04:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
so where are we at we're at 48 48 488
 
04:17:21.760 --> 04:17:22.710 align:start position:0%
so where are we at we're at 48 48 488
okay

04:17:22.710 --> 04:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
representative greeson second by
 
04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative patouzik moves to retain
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 488
 
04:17:30.870 --> 04:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
and representative uh
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
griezmann is going to speak to his
 
04:17:32.399 --> 04:17:33.750 align:start position:0%
griezmann is going to speak to his
motion

04:17:33.750 --> 04:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
okay yeah sorry about that i i got uh
 
04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
booted out of the uh the session there
 
04:17:40.950 --> 04:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i was able to get back in
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
time here uh so uh house bill 488 the
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
original uh bill was to establish a
 
04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
committee to study the benefits of
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
allowing new hampshire citizens to
 
04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
purchase health insurance from
 
04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
out-of-state companies and in uh
 
04:17:56.710 --> 04:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
discussing the bill it was determined
 
04:17:57.670 --> 04:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh the direction that this committee
 
04:18:02.309 --> 04:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
would be going in may not be
 
04:18:02.319 --> 04:18:03.349 align:start position:0%
would be going in may not be
um

04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
may not be the right direction or or we
 
04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
need more guidance and so
 
04:18:10.149 --> 04:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh i'm moving to retain it so that we
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
can give it some more guidance we can
 
04:18:13.830 --> 04:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
make sure we have the proper membership
 
04:18:15.910 --> 04:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
on the committee give them a little bit
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
more specific uh for example it was
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
brought up making sure that they uh look
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
into single-payer uh the feasibility of
 
04:18:25.110 --> 04:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
implementing free market driven health
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
care plans etc like a la carte plans
 
04:18:29.670 --> 04:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
basically giving them more specific
 
04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
directions to be able to come back and
 
04:18:31.199 --> 04:18:32.469 align:start position:0%
directions to be able to come back and
give

04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
give
 
04:18:35.110 --> 04:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
better uh answers to uh to what we're
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
looking for because we're all we're all
 
04:18:38.149 --> 04:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
aiming for the same thing we want to
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
bring people's out of pocket uh
 
04:18:42.870 --> 04:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare expenses medical expenses
 
04:18:44.950 --> 04:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
down and so how do we best go about
 
04:18:47.110 --> 04:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
doing that and so if we retain it i
 
04:18:49.110 --> 04:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
think we can we can give this committee
 
04:18:49.120 --> 04:18:49.910 align:start position:0%
think we can we can give this committee
uh

04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:52.229 --> 04:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh a better direction
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
so by understanding the correct thing
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
you're it's not that you want to focus
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
on the outer buying health insurance
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
across state lines is that you would
 
04:19:01.510 --> 04:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
like to have
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
work do some work and figure out how we
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
can make health insurance premiums lower
 
04:19:08.149 --> 04:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
correct yes and if we give it more
 
04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
direction then
 
04:19:12.870 --> 04:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
specifying a little bit better a
 
04:19:15.110 --> 04:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
course of action as opposed to the broad
 
04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
statement uh that was initially
 
04:19:19.429 --> 04:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
introduced then then we can make better
 
04:19:20.790 --> 04:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
use of the committee
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay great representative bartlett
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
um i'll let somebody else on my side um
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
speak first i'll i'll um
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
speak afterwards
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative van houghton
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um this is a committee this
 
04:19:38.790 --> 04:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
is only to set up a committee i i agree
 
04:19:40.469 --> 04:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
with the scope of the committee that
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
that the charge of the committee would
 
04:19:44.229 --> 04:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
be very very broad but to set up a
 
04:19:46.229 --> 04:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
committee i think is is
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
just to go
 
04:19:50.149 --> 04:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
into the deep end without a paddle um i
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
do think this is probably worthy of an
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
ito it might have some validity but i
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be totally reworked
 
04:19:57.429 --> 04:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
and i think that's more than we can
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
handle we we as a legislature are taking
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
on many many bills valid bills that need
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
to be spruced up and spiffed up and put
 
04:20:08.550 --> 04:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
back out but if we keep taking on on
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
very difficult tasks tests that are
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
unlikely to be
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
met i think that we are going to be in
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty and again we're talking about
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
a committee here which deals with
 
04:20:20.149 --> 04:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
legislators rather than getting into the
 
04:20:22.469 --> 04:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
experts from the legislature who i think
 
04:20:24.550 --> 04:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
should probably be brought in
 
04:20:26.149 --> 04:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
i just think it's too much i think uh
 
04:20:28.389 --> 04:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
itl is the only the only direction that
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
i can see is as as workable despite the
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
intent of those people who brought it
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
forward thank you
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:42.960 --> 04:20:47.349 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
sorry i left it off but i i with the
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
echoing i turned a bit so
 
04:20:56.229 --> 04:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
jeff i absolutely commend where you're
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
going with this and i'm glad to hear
 
04:20:59.830 --> 04:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
that you're saying that you want to
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
expand it to look at more than out of
 
04:21:04.710 --> 04:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
state but we've had so many i don't know
 
04:21:06.389 --> 04:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
if you've looked into
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
um the committees and commissions that
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
have already been established that are
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
working on this now um i know jerry
 
04:21:15.750 --> 04:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
kanark and and a team of people that he
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
was working with last term um
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
was really involved in this already and
 
04:21:23.910 --> 04:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
i i'd wondered had you had an
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to anybody maybe
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
pam has information about this but i
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
think this is already being done um and
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i i think i would itl
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
this and i would
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
um maybe get involved or or look into
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
the commissions and committees that are
 
04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
already looking at this very subject
 
04:21:42.880 --> 04:21:44.870 align:start position:0%
already looking at this very subject
already

04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
i was not aware thank you for the for
 
04:21:48.950 --> 04:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
the question i i i was not aware of
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
anything that was presently underway uh
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
it would certainly be we don't want to
 
04:21:55.030 --> 04:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
duplicate efforts that just becomes a
 
04:21:56.309 --> 04:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
waste of time
 
04:21:58.630 --> 04:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
um but if we
 
04:21:58.640 --> 04:21:59.429 align:start position:0%
um but if we
uh

04:21:59.429 --> 04:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:22:01.510 --> 04:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:22:04.309 --> 04:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
i guess what it would come down to is
 
04:22:06.070 --> 04:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
who's doing what
 
04:22:08.309 --> 04:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
where are they in what they're doing and
 
04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
when are they going to have something
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
finished that we can talk about
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
and so um if we
 
04:22:17.189 --> 04:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
can come up with something that says
 
04:22:20.309 --> 04:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
here's a fixed amount of time
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
explore the this direction come back
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
with your findings by
 
04:22:25.199 --> 04:22:26.070 align:start position:0%
with your findings by
and

04:22:26.070 --> 04:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh and then maybe maybe something
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually gets done about it because we
 
04:22:31.750 --> 04:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
could send this thing off into the abyss
 
04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
and nothing ever gets done about it we
 
04:22:35.429 --> 04:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
sure felt good about looking into it and
 
04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
so uh i i i think that if we
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
point it in the right direction and give
 
04:22:41.750 --> 04:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
it a deadline maybe we'll come up with
 
04:22:41.760 --> 04:22:44.309 align:start position:0%
it a deadline maybe we'll come up with
something

04:22:44.309 --> 04:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:47.830 --> 04:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
um actually this is a question for the
 
04:22:51.990 --> 04:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
chair on a retain motion
 
04:22:55.110 --> 04:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
um if we do choose to to retain this can
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
the retainment itself be kind of done as
 
04:22:59.110 --> 04:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
as like an ad hoc
 
04:23:01.429 --> 04:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with the
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
not subcommittee but an ad hoc committee
 
04:23:04.870 --> 04:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
of just volunteers who get together
 
04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
discuss it maybe won't need a
 
04:23:08.630 --> 04:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee at all or a commission at
 
04:23:08.640 --> 04:23:09.349 align:start position:0%
subcommittee at all or a commission at
all

04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
um well again
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
by retaining it we will will be able to
 
04:23:15.750 --> 04:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
work on it in the in the fall
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
and in terms of anybody ad hoc wants to
 
04:23:20.630 --> 04:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
work on it they can certainly do that um
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the bill you know
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
either gets amended or gets killed or
 
04:23:27.750 --> 04:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
gets re-referred for interim study can
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
have three different motions come come
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.910 --> 04:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay and now you're ready representative
 
04:23:37.110 --> 04:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
yes i am
 
04:23:39.990 --> 04:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
thanks um i i appreciate everybody's
 
04:23:42.469 --> 04:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
input on this one there's a
 
04:23:44.870 --> 04:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
deadline on this committee that
 
04:23:44.880 --> 04:23:45.990 align:start position:0%
deadline on this committee that
commission

04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
of november 1st of this year
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
two and so if we don't even look at it
 
04:23:52.790 --> 04:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
until september or october
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
there's no time at all two
 
04:23:58.229 --> 04:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
um it's a committee not a commission so
 
04:24:01.269 --> 04:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's only members of the legislature who
 
04:24:03.269 --> 04:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
are already going to be out straight in
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
september and october
 
04:24:04.880 --> 04:24:05.990 align:start position:0%
september and october
three

04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's so broad
 
04:24:07.920 --> 04:24:10.950 align:start position:0%
it's so broad
that

04:24:10.950 --> 04:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:13.269 --> 04:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
three people four people can't do it
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative fargo's right we've we've
 
04:24:19.510 --> 04:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
already got a commission working on this
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
um tyler brennan also came to us and we
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
do pay attention to what tyler says um
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
he says there's many providers many of
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
them are not licensed
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
um we need a local president and the out
 
04:24:33.030 --> 04:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
of state carriers are going to have a
 
04:24:34.469 --> 04:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
really tough time
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
being able to negotiate insurance
 
04:24:36.239 --> 04:24:37.269 align:start position:0%
being able to negotiate insurance
benefits

04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
in state um so for all of those reasons
 
04:24:40.399 --> 04:24:41.910 align:start position:0%
in state um so for all of those reasons
i

04:24:41.910 --> 04:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:24:43.590 --> 04:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
really don't think this is something
 
04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
that a committee can look at by november
 
04:24:46.880 --> 04:24:47.750 align:start position:0%
that a committee can look at by november
1st

04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
1st
 
04:24:50.149 --> 04:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
um and i'm going to vote to itl i'm
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
sorry i
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
agree with the intent but
 
04:24:55.110 --> 04:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
04:24:55.120 --> 04:24:56.309 align:start position:0%
it it's
um

04:24:56.309 --> 04:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to do what
 
04:25:01.030 --> 04:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
the goal of the of the bill is
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay so the pending motion is to retain
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
so my question is if we retain it and we
 
04:25:12.309 --> 04:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
find out that there is
 
04:25:13.830 --> 04:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
other bills
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
out there that are similar
 
04:25:18.790 --> 04:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that then you know by at least
 
04:25:20.870 --> 04:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
us retaining making sure that the other
 
04:25:23.590 --> 04:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
bills are out
 
04:25:25.349 --> 04:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
there and then we don't have to worry
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
about it
 
04:25:28.950 --> 04:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
but at least it gives us the opportunity
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
if we have to fix it to fix it later
 
04:25:33.990 --> 04:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
we can certainly decide come this fall
 
04:25:38.469 --> 04:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:41.830 --> 04:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay is the motion clear to retain
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:48.319 --> 04:25:49.510 align:start position:0%

adding additional definition for
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
qualified charitable gift annuity issued
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
by a charitable organization
 
04:37:07.109 --> 04:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but there's so
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
many tlas in here i was confused
 
04:37:11.119 --> 04:37:11.990 align:start position:0%
many tlas in here i was confused
uh

04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:14.629 --> 04:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
there's got to be clarification i my
 
04:37:14.639 --> 04:37:15.670 align:start position:0%
there's got to be clarification i my
notes

04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
notes
 
04:37:15.680 --> 04:37:16.470 align:start position:0%
notes
i've

04:37:16.470 --> 04:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
i've
 
04:37:18.789 --> 04:37:18.799 align:start position:0%
looked at them and they still don't make
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense
 
04:37:20.480 --> 04:37:22.230 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense
um

04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
an annuity is an insurance product
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
and it just
 
04:37:30.869 --> 04:37:30.879 align:start position:0%
is confusing and i move
 
04:37:33.029 --> 04:37:33.039 align:start position:0%
to retain it so i can get some more
 
04:37:35.670 --> 04:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge and understanding of what this
 
04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
is about
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll tell you the reason why i want
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
to retain this bill
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
is as you might remember it had uh two
 
04:37:47.670 --> 04:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
limitations how long the charitable
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
entity existed the organization existed
 
04:37:52.150 --> 04:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
and what its
 
04:37:53.670 --> 04:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
net worth was
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:37:57.990 --> 04:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the uh the sponsor did send out an
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
amendment uh to try to just move those
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
numbers around
 
04:38:04.470 --> 04:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
but um i actually again here i guess is
 
04:38:08.470 --> 04:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
my old dog um we actually deal deal this
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
subject material gift annuities many
 
04:38:11.670 --> 04:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
many years ago
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
when it came to um
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:38:22.150 --> 04:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
and the issue was that people were
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
setting up terrible annuities and in
 
04:38:26.789 --> 04:38:26.799 align:start position:0%
that we made a requirement that the the
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
non-profit had to have a million dollar
 
04:38:29.039 --> 04:38:30.230 align:start position:0%
non-profit had to have a million dollar
asset

04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
asset
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
and because the assumption was that with
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
a million dollar asset that they would
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
have the
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who's working who works there
 
04:38:40.949 --> 04:38:40.959 align:start position:0%
who has the the horsepower to understand
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
what how this annuity works how to make
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
the investments and do the proper work
 
04:38:48.230 --> 04:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the immunity the you know
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
the investments
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
were preserved so in that sense i want
 
04:38:54.789 --> 04:38:54.799 align:start position:0%
to retain it and since it's really very
 
04:38:57.189 --> 04:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
similar to what we dealt with already
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
i think that we can fix this correctly
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
but we could not do it now
 
04:39:01.840 --> 04:39:02.869 align:start position:0%
but we could not do it now
so

04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:05.670 --> 04:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
first up is representative bartlett
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
i'm going to defer to representative
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
fargo or abolio and i will speak last
 
04:39:11.680 --> 04:39:12.709 align:start position:0%
fargo or abolio and i will speak last
okay

04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
i'll do that from now on
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
so next up is representative fargo
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chair i have a few
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
concerns about this that i would prefer
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
just to ideal this um tom donovan from
 
04:39:29.670 --> 04:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
the um trust department has concerns
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
these um charitable annuities are not
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
regulated i think from a consumer
 
04:39:36.629 --> 04:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
protection perspective
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
this could be dangerous again
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
similar to representative terry i think
 
04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
this is a person who may be using
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
legislation to further his business and
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
i just not comfortable with this so um
 
04:39:52.470 --> 04:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote against the retainer
 
04:39:56.230 --> 04:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
and i would prefer to itles
 
04:39:57.910 --> 04:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
right i understand that i did talk to
 
04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
tom donovan and he his issue the
 
04:40:03.510 --> 04:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that he that was sent out did
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
address his problem so in that sense he
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
was all set but i have to admit i was
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
not all set because i just don't think
 
04:40:10.798 --> 04:40:11.750 align:start position:0%
not all set because i just don't think
um

04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know the the the limits 25 or i
 
04:40:15.670 --> 04:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
think he raised it to 50 or something
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
the limit
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's just too small and you're
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
the net asset of the charitable trust
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
and and i think we want to make sure
 
04:40:26.310 --> 04:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
that when we pass this we um we are
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
doing proper consumer protection
 
04:40:30.628 --> 04:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
i hope to do that through by retaining
 
04:40:30.638 --> 04:40:32.708 align:start position:0%
i hope to do that through by retaining
it

04:40:32.708 --> 04:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:40:32.718 --> 04:40:33.750 align:start position:0%
it
representative

04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:40:35.430 --> 04:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
took her put her hand down so now you're
 
04:40:36.550 --> 04:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
up bartlett
 
04:40:36.560 --> 04:40:37.510 align:start position:0%
up bartlett
okay

04:40:37.510 --> 04:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:37.520 --> 04:40:41.270 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:43.110 --> 04:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
i have some
 
04:40:45.030 --> 04:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill
 
04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
um we've already identified what some of
 
04:40:49.750 --> 04:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
them are i am willing to look at the
 
04:40:49.760 --> 04:40:51.350 align:start position:0%
them are i am willing to look at the
amendments

04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
um and try to get a clearer picture of
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
i i think i understand what the goals
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
are but i don't understand the
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
mechanisms so i'm willing to go along
 
04:41:03.750 --> 04:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
with the retention though it's going to
 
04:41:06.070 --> 04:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
take an awful lot to persuade me
 
04:41:06.080 --> 04:41:06.948 align:start position:0%
take an awful lot to persuade me
that

04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:09.190 --> 04:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
04:41:12.070 --> 04:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on the motion to
 
04:41:12.080 --> 04:41:14.310 align:start position:0%

and representative would you like to
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
speak about it or i think we're all
 
04:42:54.310 --> 04:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
pretty much ready to vote yeah if you
 
04:42:56.788 --> 04:42:56.798 align:start position:0%

04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%

okay uh well representative abramson has
a

04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
something to say yes
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
actually this is another one of those
 
04:43:05.590 --> 04:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
bills where i agreed with what they were
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do but when we opened up the
 
04:43:08.708 --> 04:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
bill i saw
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
at least three different problems with a
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
in my case i would ask the sponsors to
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
come back next session with with
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
something else working with the
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders but uh
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
i didn't think that the committee could
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's only two sentence bill and three
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
problems and
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
two sentence bills probably one too many
 
04:43:27.840 --> 04:43:28.628 align:start position:0%
two sentence bills probably one too many
right

04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
and hopefully next time he'll show up to
 
04:43:31.510 --> 04:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
04:43:31.520 --> 04:43:33.430 align:start position:0%
the hearing
okay

04:43:33.430 --> 04:43:33.440 align:start position:0%

bill and i i don't see any reason to
 
04:43:55.030 --> 04:43:55.040 align:start position:0%

04:46:11.910 --> 04:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
and it also passes the motion
 
04:46:13.510 --> 04:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:15.280 --> 04:46:16.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

04:46:16.230 --> 04:46:16.240 align:start position:0%

uh house bill 592
 
04:46:18.638 --> 04:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 592
um

04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:23.590 --> 04:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine bond
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative greeson moves second by
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
representative patusek to retain
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
and representative greeson is recognized
 
04:46:32.230 --> 04:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
to speak to his motion
 
04:46:35.430 --> 04:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh so this uh
 
04:46:38.310 --> 04:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
this bill uh proposes to establish a
 
04:46:40.550 --> 04:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
means for those who've been injured by
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines to receive compensation and in
 
04:46:47.350 --> 04:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
the uh in the hearings the number one
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
concern was will we buck up against the
 
04:46:53.590 --> 04:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
federal program and otherwise there
 
04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to be any objections to
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
doing something just making sure that
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
this would not be subsequently uh found
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh if in a legal challenge to to be
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
overridden by any federal program so i
 
04:47:08.230 --> 04:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh i received uh and actually it was
 
04:47:10.708 --> 04:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
unsolicited as somebody who was watching
 
04:47:14.550 --> 04:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
the the hearings actually uh uh
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
it was an attorney and uh sent her
 
04:47:20.550 --> 04:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
opinion that there should be no problem
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
with with going forward with this
 
04:47:24.550 --> 04:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and so
 
04:47:27.910 --> 04:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
obviously one is is one opinion and so i
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
am now actively seeking additional legal
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
opinions just to make sure uh but if
 
04:47:34.230 --> 04:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
we're given a little bit more time i
 
04:47:35.910 --> 04:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
think we can make this we can address
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
that issue uh then of course the uh
 
04:47:41.110 --> 04:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
04:47:41.120 --> 04:47:42.470 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
services

04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're the the
 
04:47:43.440 --> 04:47:44.550 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're the the
appropriate

04:47:44.550 --> 04:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh agency to for controlling uh for
 
04:47:49.750 --> 04:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
handling this so it just there's uh it
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
seemed to me that there wasn't any
 
04:47:52.470 --> 04:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
opposition to doing something it was
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
just making sure that what we're trying
 
04:47:55.830 --> 04:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
to do can be done and so give it a
 
04:47:57.270 --> 04:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more time i'm actually able
 
04:48:00.230 --> 04:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
to uh i'm reworking already i've been in
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
the process of doing that and so uh the
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
biggest hurdle being the preemption of
 
04:48:07.190 --> 04:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
the federal program i think we've been
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
able to leap that so give it a little
 
04:48:10.868 --> 04:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
bit more time we can plug the holes and
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:14.400 --> 04:48:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:48:15.270 --> 04:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson had his hand
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
up first um i did receive a lot of
 
04:48:21.910 --> 04:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
emails in support of this bill and
 
04:48:23.670 --> 04:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
asking that something be done including
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
from constituents in my district so i'll
 
04:48:28.550 --> 04:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
be supporting the retain and uh but it
 
04:48:31.190 --> 04:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
does apparently require uh quite a bit
 
04:48:32.628 --> 04:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
of legal research to get something done
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett oh do you want
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
me to be last or you want to do that let
 
04:48:39.670 --> 04:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
me be asked
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abel
 
04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh i i see the problem
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh with this bill being
 
04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
that no
 
04:48:52.868 --> 04:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company will post a bond
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
and so the only thing that can possibly
 
04:48:56.550 --> 04:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
happen is
 
04:48:58.948 --> 04:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
vaccines won't be available in the state
 
04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so i'm opposed to this
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
and uh would have a different motion
 
04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i totally agree with
 
04:49:14.948 --> 04:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
what representative abel has said um it
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
just appears to be very quick a
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk reaction to a pandemic uh and
 
04:49:19.520 --> 04:49:20.310 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk reaction to a pandemic uh and
and

04:49:20.310 --> 04:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
therefore the holes that were mentioned
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
by the sponsor perhaps are much too
 
04:49:25.830 --> 04:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
large at this stage of the game to even
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
go to retention again i've said it
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
before and i'll say it again to retain
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
so many bills and to expect that in a
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
short time in september or october we
 
04:49:36.470 --> 04:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
can bring them all to to do justice
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
especially those with as many holes as i
 
04:49:41.110 --> 04:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
see in this one is is folly right now i
 
04:49:42.628 --> 04:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
think we need to attend to those that
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
are fixable that that can be um
 
04:49:47.110 --> 04:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh patched up and and brought to bear
 
04:49:49.830 --> 04:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
for for our constituents and leave those
 
04:49:51.510 --> 04:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
that are much larger to be repaired and
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
brought back in the next session thank
 
04:49:53.600 --> 04:49:55.030 align:start position:0%
brought back in the next session thank
you

04:49:55.030 --> 04:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:49:58.628 --> 04:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
04:50:01.510 --> 04:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i too i'm going to
 
04:50:01.520 --> 04:50:02.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i too i'm going to
uh

04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to itl this bill
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh there are way too many problems and
 
04:50:10.230 --> 04:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh i do believe that um if this bill
 
04:50:13.990 --> 04:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
passes there um will be some issues with
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
um vaccination um that definitely needs
 
04:50:19.670 --> 04:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
to happen thank you
 
04:50:22.628 --> 04:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
okay representative greeson
 
04:50:25.350 --> 04:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to address the uh
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
the idea that this is a knee-jerk
 
04:50:30.788 --> 04:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
reaction to a pandemic uh actually this
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
bill does not focus on anything
 
04:50:36.070 --> 04:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
covid related whatsoever this is all
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines uh regardless of the nature of
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
it uh so it is not a knee-jerk reaction
 
04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh people have been having
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh issues with with vaccine injuries for
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
for many many years uh long before the
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
04:50:54.788 --> 04:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
timing of it sure uh we could be able to
 
04:50:57.670 --> 04:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
take advantage of of anything i know of
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
nine deaths reported in the state of new
 
04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire due to the covid vaccine uh
 
04:51:05.590 --> 04:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
but uh as far as this the being the
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
impetus for this bill
 
04:51:10.470 --> 04:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.150 --> 04:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:51:15.670 --> 04:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
i assume the uh uh
 
04:51:17.510 --> 04:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
some of the hands are still up or just
 
04:51:19.750 --> 04:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure i get the right people who
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
want to speak
 
04:51:22.948 --> 04:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartlett
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:51:24.480 --> 04:51:25.350 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

04:51:25.350 --> 04:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:27.750 --> 04:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
i i really believe that this is a way of
 
04:51:27.760 --> 04:51:31.190 align:start position:0%
i i really believe that this is a way of
depressing

04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
taking vaccines
 
04:51:35.590 --> 04:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
by those that are opposed to vaccines in
 
04:51:35.600 --> 04:51:36.948 align:start position:0%
by those that are opposed to vaccines in
general

04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
general
 
04:51:36.958 --> 04:51:38.948 align:start position:0%
general
i

04:51:38.948 --> 04:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a
 
04:51:41.280 --> 04:51:42.390 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a
solution

04:51:42.390 --> 04:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
solution
 
04:51:44.550 --> 04:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
to the problem this person um or this
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
this group seems to have and i will be
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
voting to itl this
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh all right so
 
04:51:54.868 --> 04:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative fargo have did you
 
04:51:56.390 --> 04:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
um i think this is a wrong message for
 
04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
this time i think that people make a
 
04:52:02.230 --> 04:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
choice whether or not they're going to
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
have a vaccine and they assume the risk
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
when they choose to be vaccinated
 
04:52:08.070 --> 04:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:52:12.390 --> 04:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
i i agree with rich on this one i i
 
04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
i think that if we did something like
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
this the pharmacy
 
04:52:16.480 --> 04:52:17.270 align:start position:0%
this the pharmacy
may

04:52:17.270 --> 04:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
decide that they don't want to offer
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
certain vaccines in new hampshire i
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
think this is a dangerous bill right now
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:29.270 --> 04:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay so so rich and connie did you guys
 
04:52:31.350 --> 04:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
want to speak again or
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh okay representative van gaal
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
yes um i would just like to respond to
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
the idea that this is not a knee-jerk
 
04:52:39.830 --> 04:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
reaction to the covet pandemic and it
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
may not be and i do respect the sponsor
 
04:52:44.788 --> 04:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
and and his comments there um but i'm
 
04:52:46.550 --> 04:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
wondering now if the intent of this bill
 
04:52:49.270 --> 04:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
is to go back to all vaccine
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
providers for instance all those that
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
provide um
 
04:52:55.430 --> 04:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
infant vaccine vaccinations vaccinations
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
that are required for school
 
04:52:59.030 --> 04:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
administration i think we're opening up
 
04:53:00.470 --> 04:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
if that's the case we're opening up a
 
04:53:02.230 --> 04:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
very large ball of wax it'll be very
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
difficult to unravel and i'm even more
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
convinced than ever that itl is the only
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
direction to go here on that basis
 
04:53:10.320 --> 04:53:11.750 align:start position:0%
direction to go here on that basis
okay

04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
all right so uh
 
04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative burroughs have you
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
spoken yet
 
04:53:19.670 --> 04:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to say i did a
 
04:53:22.470 --> 04:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
quick fact check and there's been no
 
04:53:24.708 --> 04:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
um on from a number of sources not just
 
04:53:26.788 --> 04:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
one and there's been no proven links
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
between the vaccinations and deaths
 
04:53:31.030 --> 04:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
there i i think there was a reference to
 
04:53:33.510 --> 04:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
nine deaths um those were reported to
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
have been attributed to complications
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
from covet 19. cdc veers program
 
04:53:41.750 --> 04:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
the cdc veers
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what they report or the
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
deaths due to uh due to vaccines and
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
they're reporting nine um
 
04:53:51.030 --> 04:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
so what what
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's not just new hampshire you're
 
04:53:53.590 --> 04:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the entire country there's
 
04:53:55.030 --> 04:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
only been no that's the state state of
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay that's the federal the felony
 
04:54:02.080 --> 04:54:03.430 align:start position:0%
okay that's the federal the felony
program

04:54:03.430 --> 04:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:54:04.948 --> 04:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
from from where that's right that's
 
04:54:07.030 --> 04:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
where i got the data there was a website
 
04:54:10.150 --> 04:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'll have to take responsibility i i led
 
04:54:12.310 --> 04:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative greeson to the federal
 
04:54:14.070 --> 04:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
compensation which there is a federal
 
04:54:16.150 --> 04:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
compensation plan already and
 
04:54:18.230 --> 04:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
in fact and they're the ones who are
 
04:54:20.708 --> 04:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
tracking this and so
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
he is he has found that piece of
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
information so uh i have no reason it's
 
04:54:28.550 --> 04:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
not my numbers it's the cdc but give us
 
04:54:30.310 --> 04:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
a website that we could look at look it
 
04:54:30.320 --> 04:54:33.030 align:start position:0%
a website that we could look at look it
up

04:54:33.030 --> 04:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:35.510 --> 04:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
yeah no problem uh
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's through the cdc
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
and you just if you go to the cdc and
 
04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
look up vaccine um but he's talking
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
about something specific i would like
 
04:54:47.190 --> 04:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
him to give us the website
 
04:54:49.350 --> 04:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay well all right
 
04:54:50.628 --> 04:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
is that going to really change your mind
 
04:54:52.628 --> 04:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
that if you found out that it wasn't
 
04:54:54.628 --> 04:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
chairman do we have to do this
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do this right now
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay he will get that if if you're not
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you're not open to have your mind
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
changed i won't waste my time sending
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
you the link but it is the uh
 
04:55:04.948 --> 04:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
centers for disease control they have
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
they call the va ers
 
04:55:09.510 --> 04:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh and so you can look it up on your own
 
04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
you can do a search for based on
 
04:55:15.270 --> 04:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
symptoms and vaccine type and your state
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
you can do the search criteria and you
 
04:55:20.470 --> 04:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
will come up with the number nine
 
04:55:20.480 --> 04:55:22.310 align:start position:0%
will come up with the number nine
okay

04:55:22.310 --> 04:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:55:24.550 --> 04:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
so uh representative abramson you still
 
04:55:26.310 --> 04:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
have your hand up yeah it's a point of
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
order uh members we're not to uh cast
 
04:55:31.990 --> 04:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
aspersions or or challenge the motives
 
04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
of other members i heard that a couple
 
04:55:35.350 --> 04:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
of different comments um i did have one
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
comment um that there is a vaccine
 
04:55:40.708 --> 04:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
injury fund that's paid out i think it's
 
04:55:42.788 --> 04:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
something over 4 billion dollars
 
04:55:44.868 --> 04:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
but in the last 10 years very very few
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
people have even bothered
 
04:55:46.480 --> 04:55:47.190 align:start position:0%
people have even bothered
to

04:55:47.190 --> 04:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:55:48.628 --> 04:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
hire an attorney it's very difficult to
 
04:55:50.310 --> 04:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
hire an attorney
 
04:55:52.708 --> 04:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
and go after compensation which is
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
limited to two hundred fifty thousand
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
dollars and only six percent of people
 
04:55:57.190 --> 04:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
have prevailed
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh so there are many many many times
 
04:56:01.990 --> 04:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
more people who suffered injury death
 
04:56:04.550 --> 04:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
disability autism or other types of
 
04:56:06.830 --> 04:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury where
 
04:56:10.230 --> 04:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
um they have have not even pursued it as
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
a legal issue because they know that
 
04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
they have very little chance of
 
04:56:15.670 --> 04:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:15.680 --> 04:56:17.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:56:17.840 --> 04:56:18.990 align:start position:0%

04:58:17.110 --> 04:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:58:18.948 --> 04:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine
 
04:58:18.958 --> 04:58:19.990 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine
um

04:58:19.990 --> 04:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:22.150 --> 04:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to do it but
 
04:58:23.830 --> 04:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
with the computer being used for the
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting i didn't have access to
 
04:58:28.310 --> 04:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
that i'm just surprised that legislative
 
04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
services would send us an amendment if
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
they knew that
 
04:58:33.910 --> 04:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
that there was a problem with the
 
04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
amendment they would have told us about
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
it i would think
 
04:58:39.670 --> 04:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
i would have thought the same thing
 
04:58:39.680 --> 04:58:40.788 align:start position:0%
i would have thought the same thing
so

04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
so representative abramson are you is do
 
04:58:44.390 --> 04:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
you really want to fall on your sword on
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
this one or can can we go with uh
 
04:58:49.830 --> 04:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh upon passage because i i i feel like
 
04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
i passed upon passage all the time i
 
04:58:53.110 --> 04:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
feel like do it
 
04:58:54.868 --> 04:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
at least session i feel like i passed
 
04:58:57.430 --> 04:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
one or two bills that's upon passage
 
04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i i i'm willing to go with this uh
 
04:59:02.788 --> 04:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
representative abramson if you're
 
04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
i mean if you want to vote no that's
 
04:59:05.270 --> 04:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
fine but
 
04:59:05.280 --> 04:59:06.628 align:start position:0%
fine but

04:59:06.628 --> 04:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:09.030 --> 04:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
how do you feel
 
04:59:13.270 --> 04:59:13.280 align:start position:0%

uh you're still muted not on muting oh
 
04:59:17.910 --> 04:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
nope you unmuted and then you muted
 
04:59:17.920 --> 04:59:20.310 align:start position:0%
nope you unmuted and then you muted
yourself

04:59:20.310 --> 04:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
oh there's another button for unmuting
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did we move i'm sorry what was
 
04:59:27.190 --> 04:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
the vote on uh
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
retained ten to nine
 
04:59:31.830 --> 04:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
yeah oh
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we retained 592.
 
04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
and we're at 5.93
 
04:59:39.910 --> 04:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
now on 593. oh you're talking about the
 
04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
amendment um wasn't it uh
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
representative van houden didn't uh you
 
04:59:46.150 --> 04:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
have the one that takes effect in 60
 
04:59:46.160 --> 04:59:46.948 align:start position:0%
have the one that takes effect in 60
days

04:59:46.948 --> 04:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
days
 
04:59:46.958 --> 04:59:48.310 align:start position:0%
days
yes

04:59:48.310 --> 04:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:59:50.948 --> 04:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
so shouldn't we just move forward on uh
 
04:59:53.910 --> 04:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
her amendment well i like the sunset so
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
i would take the first amendment first
 
04:59:58.708 --> 04:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
and then we can take up the second
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
amendment second which would then
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
replace the first amendment with that
 
05:00:04.470 --> 05:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
length with the changing of the
 
05:00:04.480 --> 05:00:05.590 align:start position:0%
length with the changing of the
uh

05:00:05.590 --> 05:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
05:00:09.750 --> 05:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
so would we need to move the
 
05:00:12.310 --> 05:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
first we want to first move uh
 
05:00:14.230 --> 05:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett's amendment that
 
05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
was sent out
 
05:00:16.240 --> 05:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
was sent out
582

05:00:19.830 --> 05:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
is that the that's the uh amendment
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
number 582
 
05:00:23.040 --> 05:00:24.070 align:start position:0%
number 582
yeah

05:00:24.070 --> 05:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:00:26.230 --> 05:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
okay so representative uh bart second by
 
05:00:28.628 --> 05:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
representative hunt uh moves out to pass
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
on the amendment 582 and representative
 
05:00:31.750 --> 05:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
bartlett you're recognized to speak to
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
your motion thank you
 
05:00:35.200 --> 05:00:35.990 align:start position:0%
your motion thank you
i'm

05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:00:37.750 --> 05:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do this on the phone and on
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
here at the same time um
 
05:00:42.628 --> 05:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:44.948 --> 05:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
we all i think we all agree that um
 
05:00:46.948 --> 05:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
we've got a problem with the delivery
 
05:00:50.310 --> 05:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
services um and the small
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants are particularly being
 
05:00:54.070 --> 05:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
affected whether they have
 
05:00:57.190 --> 05:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
a website that can be updated regularly
 
05:00:59.910 --> 05:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
whether these delivery services are just
 
05:00:59.920 --> 05:01:01.670 align:start position:0%
whether these delivery services are just
automatically

05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
05:01:04.230 --> 05:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
putting it on their their website and
 
05:01:08.310 --> 05:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
offering these restaurants as a possible
 
05:01:08.320 --> 05:01:09.350 align:start position:0%
offering these restaurants as a possible
delivery

05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
05:01:11.430 --> 05:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
or whether they tell them or not
 
05:01:11.440 --> 05:01:12.470 align:start position:0%
or whether they tell them or not
um

05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:14.708 --> 05:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
it bothered me a lot that they collected
 
05:01:17.670 --> 05:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
the tips it bothered me a lot that if
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
there's a refund to be made by the
 
05:01:19.200 --> 05:01:20.390 align:start position:0%
there's a refund to be made by the
restaurant

05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
05:01:22.868 --> 05:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
the delivery service does not
 
05:01:24.390 --> 05:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
do the refund it would have to come from
 
05:01:25.350 --> 05:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
the restaurant and there's no
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from the delivery service
 
05:01:29.030 --> 05:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
to the restaurant
 
05:01:31.030 --> 05:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
um it bothered me that there was no
 
05:01:32.550 --> 05:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
contract involved
 
05:01:35.190 --> 05:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
in in these delivery services doing this
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
automatically for a hefty surcharge um
 
05:01:42.470 --> 05:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
the example we had from mr boucher
 
05:01:45.190 --> 05:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
the owner of t-bones in um copper door
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
and um cactus jacks
 
05:01:49.510 --> 05:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
was that a 14 burger would end up
 
05:01:52.628 --> 05:01:52.638 align:start position:0%
costing 29 when it was delivered
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:01:56.470 --> 05:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
and and quality couldn't be
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
guaranteed either because you know how
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
long it'll take for these delivery
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
services to actually deliver the meals
 
05:02:03.120 --> 05:02:04.390 align:start position:0%
services to actually deliver the meals
so

05:02:04.390 --> 05:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:04.400 --> 05:02:05.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:02:05.510 --> 05:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:08.230 --> 05:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
and that they have not that that unless
 
05:02:10.550 --> 05:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
a small business is willing to
 
05:02:12.788 --> 05:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
sue the delivery service they really
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
don't have much of a recourse
 
05:02:19.670 --> 05:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
so my feeling is that this amendment um
 
05:02:21.350 --> 05:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
changes the original bill from being
 
05:02:24.550 --> 05:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
affected january 1st of 2022 which is
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
really too long to wait these these
 
05:02:29.590 --> 05:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
restaurants need relief now
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
and during the pandemic there are people
 
05:02:32.470 --> 05:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
that are
 
05:02:33.910 --> 05:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
willing to pay
 
05:02:37.030 --> 05:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
um the delivery service services um now
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to have a
 
05:02:40.628 --> 05:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
a take-out meal
 
05:02:43.750 --> 05:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
so one part of it was that when i spoke
 
05:02:43.760 --> 05:02:44.550 align:start position:0%
so one part of it was that when i spoke
with

05:02:44.550 --> 05:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
we did discuss the bill um we did feel
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
that there was um need for relief right
 
05:02:53.510 --> 05:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
now and in the spirit of negotiating an
 
05:02:53.520 --> 05:02:55.190 align:start position:0%
now and in the spirit of negotiating an
acceptable

05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
05:02:57.030 --> 05:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that both sides could live
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
with i am willing to go along with a
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
two-year sunset clause
 
05:03:04.390 --> 05:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
now that's my my personal feeling that
 
05:03:07.270 --> 05:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh commit
 
05:03:11.670 --> 05:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else from from um
 
05:03:13.830 --> 05:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
that discussion i just thought it was so
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
important that we get
 
05:03:18.070 --> 05:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
this bill passed and over to the senate
 
05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible
 
05:03:21.910 --> 05:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
if the bill if the law needs to be
 
05:03:23.910 --> 05:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
changed and um
 
05:03:26.788 --> 05:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
delivery services go away or they change
 
05:03:28.948 --> 05:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
their practices that would give two
 
05:03:31.590 --> 05:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
years to be able to change it
 
05:03:33.430 --> 05:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
and um i think that all of us are
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
motivated to
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
look into the situation and to come back
 
05:03:40.150 --> 05:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
with changes if necessary before
 
05:03:40.160 --> 05:03:41.350 align:start position:0%
with changes if necessary before
december

05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
december
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
of 2023
 
05:03:45.990 --> 05:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason i um
 
05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
was willing to bring the amendment forth
 
05:03:51.510 --> 05:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
and um i hope that you can support it
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh representing van halen
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm in total
 
05:03:57.990 --> 05:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
agreement that the relief needs to be as
 
05:03:59.830 --> 05:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
soon as possible for these restaurants
 
05:04:02.550 --> 05:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
and and uh small cafes and other food
 
05:04:04.868 --> 05:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
purveyors i absolutely agree with that
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
and actually when i put the 60-day
 
05:04:08.070 --> 05:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
amendment in i kind of thought it had to
 
05:04:09.670 --> 05:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
be 60 days
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
i had that in the back of my mind and i
 
05:04:13.030 --> 05:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if that relates to what
 
05:04:14.948 --> 05:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
representative abramson has been saying
 
05:04:16.230 --> 05:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:04:17.750 --> 05:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
however i do have a problem with the
 
05:04:19.990 --> 05:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
sunset clause i don't think these issues
 
05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
are going to go away just because the
 
05:04:24.150 --> 05:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic may or may not go away in two
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
years we don't know what the
 
05:04:27.510 --> 05:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances will be in a few years
 
05:04:29.590 --> 05:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
future legislative legislations can make
 
05:04:30.830 --> 05:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:04:33.590 --> 05:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
determination uh we also know that and i
 
05:04:35.590 --> 05:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
i get the sense and i could be wrong
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
that most of us agree with the spirit of
 
05:04:38.948 --> 05:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
this that we want to give some relief
 
05:04:40.628 --> 05:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
and some support to these small
 
05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
restrooms and businesses that are being
 
05:04:45.030 --> 05:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of uh and so with that
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
in mind um
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
if we pass the 60 days and it's not just
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
because it's my my idea i'm very willing
 
05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
to to go with a better idea at any time
 
05:04:55.750 --> 05:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
if we pass the 60 days
 
05:04:57.910 --> 05:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
and find that we can make it better in
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
the senate we can go there and lobby and
 
05:05:01.750 --> 05:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
talk to our senators and get them to to
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
adjust things but at least we won't be
 
05:05:06.310 --> 05:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
endorsing the sunset by by voting for
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
the the amendment with the sunset clause
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
in it we are endorsing the sunset
 
05:05:11.670 --> 05:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
whereas i don't believe we should i
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
think we should leave it open-ended so
 
05:05:15.030 --> 05:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
that we can support our restrooms into
 
05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
the future if we find that it's wrong
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
future legislations can legislators can
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.788 --> 05:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that we do not have a
 
05:05:28.390 --> 05:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
sunset clause on this
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:05:31.110 --> 05:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
the people that i've spoken to the
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
constituents that are down here on our
 
05:05:35.590 --> 05:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
main street which we call elm street are
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
hurting because of this their
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
reputations are hurting i simply don't
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
want that to continue i want that to
 
05:05:43.110 --> 05:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
happen as in as timely a fashion as i
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
can but not in a way that will stop them
 
05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
from having better business in the
 
05:05:48.868 --> 05:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
future thank you
 
05:05:52.150 --> 05:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abramson
 
05:05:54.390 --> 05:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
this was just a question of uh
 
05:05:56.708 --> 05:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett um was it your
 
05:05:59.350 --> 05:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
tent with this sunset that we come back
 
05:06:01.030 --> 05:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
and revisit it or that you just wanted
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
it to be in effect for two years or you
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to see
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
what effect this has maybe in the courts
 
05:06:07.270 --> 05:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
or in the marketplace before we come
 
05:06:08.550 --> 05:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
back and and
 
05:06:08.560 --> 05:06:09.350 align:start position:0%
back and and
and

05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
reintroduce this as maybe a permanent
 
05:06:11.520 --> 05:06:15.990 align:start position:0%
reintroduce this as maybe a permanent
law

05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you that
 
05:06:20.310 --> 05:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
i was excited about putting it in but in
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
the spirit of
 
05:06:24.230 --> 05:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
compromise and being able to move this
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
forward quickly i'm willing to go along
 
05:06:29.910 --> 05:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:35.910 --> 05:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
it took me a moment and i should have
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
done the space bar
 
05:06:45.750 --> 05:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
or the reason that
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
i think it will make this bill uh more
 
05:06:52.470 --> 05:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
likely to pass
 
05:06:54.070 --> 05:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:06:56.708 --> 05:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
and so therefore i'm gonna vote for this
 
05:06:59.430 --> 05:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
amendment but i'm not gonna vote for the
 
05:07:02.070 --> 05:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
second amendment which would take take
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
this out i think this is an important
 
05:07:06.868 --> 05:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
thing uh to have a two-year look back so
 
05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:11.830 --> 05:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh next up is
 
05:07:11.840 --> 05:07:13.270 align:start position:0%
okay uh next up is
representative

05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:07:13.280 --> 05:07:14.868 align:start position:0%
representative
suzek

05:07:14.868 --> 05:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
suzek
 
05:07:16.868 --> 05:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman
 
05:07:18.070 --> 05:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
05:07:21.190 --> 05:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
as i stated before i physically went out
 
05:07:23.110 --> 05:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
and talked to about a half a dozen of
 
05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
our local small
 
05:07:25.040 --> 05:07:26.470 align:start position:0%
our local small
restaurants

05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
05:07:28.390 --> 05:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i and they told me for a fact that
 
05:07:30.230 --> 05:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
four of them have been
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
victims of the doordash
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
and i agree with representative bartlett
 
05:07:40.230 --> 05:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
that it's it's a needed to be done now
 
05:07:40.240 --> 05:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
that it's it's a needed to be done now
asap

05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
asap
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the two-year look back i agree with
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
05:07:47.830 --> 05:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
that this basically mandates us in two
 
05:07:50.230 --> 05:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
years to go back and look at it and
 
05:07:50.240 --> 05:07:51.510 align:start position:0%
years to go back and look at it and
maybe

05:07:51.510 --> 05:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
05:07:53.670 --> 05:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
just reauthorize it or
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
make it even better
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr chair
 
05:08:01.990 --> 05:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay pam now has something for us
 
05:08:06.788 --> 05:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
i i just was looking at the rsa 14
 
05:08:08.708 --> 05:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
colon 9a which is the law about
 
05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
effective dates and it outlines
 
05:08:14.230 --> 05:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
what effective dates the
 
05:08:16.390 --> 05:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services must
 
05:08:19.430 --> 05:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
include in the first draft of a bill and
 
05:08:21.910 --> 05:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced and it does say
 
05:08:23.830 --> 05:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
that each law affecting judicial
 
05:08:26.550 --> 05:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
practice and procedure or establishing
 
05:08:29.350 --> 05:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
or eliminating criminal prohibitions
 
05:08:31.750 --> 05:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
civil causes of action or remedies or
 
05:08:34.708 --> 05:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
limitations of actions shall take effect
 
05:08:37.750 --> 05:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
on january 1st following passage
 
05:08:40.628 --> 05:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
however later in the same
 
05:08:40.638 --> 05:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
however later in the same
law

05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:08:43.190 --> 05:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
when it talks about
 
05:08:45.190 --> 05:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
amendments and it says the office of
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
legislative services shall at the
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
request of the sponsor of an amendment
 
05:08:50.550 --> 05:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
include in the amendment the effective
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
date requested by the sponsor so
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's the list of effective dates that
 
05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
are required to be in that
 
05:09:02.550 --> 05:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know introduced bill and then
 
05:09:04.708 --> 05:09:04.718 align:start position:0%
this does not answer the supreme court
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
decision that representative abramson is
 
05:09:09.510 --> 05:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
is referring to it merely is what the
 
05:09:12.628 --> 05:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
state law on effective dates is right so
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
that that's what the way i remembered it
 
05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
which was the statute exists that was a
 
05:09:19.350 --> 05:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
requirement on legislative services but
 
05:09:20.628 --> 05:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
there's nothing encumbering the
 
05:09:22.708 --> 05:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
legislature to put in whatever
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
effectiveness wants for instance i
 
05:09:27.990 --> 05:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
remember when we did the
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
same day registration and we actually
 
05:09:32.070 --> 05:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
made it effective uh three months before
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
we actually voted on it
 
05:09:37.030 --> 05:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
so that can the legislature can decide
 
05:09:39.750 --> 05:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
whatever effective data it wants
 
05:09:42.230 --> 05:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative fargo's next
 
05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know i think this problem existed
 
05:09:47.670 --> 05:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic i think it's been
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
exacerbated because we do so much
 
05:09:52.390 --> 05:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
takeout now i don't think it's going
 
05:09:53.990 --> 05:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
away i think it should be passed
 
05:09:56.628 --> 05:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
immediately but i i don't see having a
 
05:09:58.868 --> 05:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
sunset clause because we don't even know
 
05:10:00.310 --> 05:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
if we're all going to be here in two
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
years to go back and look at this and i
 
05:10:02.878 --> 05:10:03.990 align:start position:0%
years to go back and look at this and i
would

05:10:03.990 --> 05:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
i would think it would be a disservice
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
to all the small restaurants who are
 
05:10:10.470 --> 05:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
suffering under this to have two years
 
05:10:13.270 --> 05:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
pass and nobody reopen this and look at
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
it i just i'm i'm totally i'm bored with
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
passing it immediately but i can't
 
05:10:21.910 --> 05:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
support the sunset claws yeah the the
 
05:10:23.750 --> 05:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the sunset class is believe
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
you me if they want it in other words if
 
05:10:27.590 --> 05:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
they get you know go through two years
 
05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they're saying is this really did
 
05:10:31.350 --> 05:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
turn out to be very important you know
 
05:10:32.948 --> 05:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
legislation and we really do need it to
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
continue believe you me the restaurant
 
05:10:37.110 --> 05:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
hospitality says you will not have
 
05:10:39.030 --> 05:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
trouble finding a representative to put
 
05:10:40.470 --> 05:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
in the bill to
 
05:10:42.550 --> 05:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
to repeal sunset
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
the reason i think it's a good idea is
 
05:10:44.638 --> 05:10:45.990 align:start position:0%
the reason i think it's a good idea is
that

05:10:45.990 --> 05:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:48.550 --> 05:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty dramatic policy and i
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
think that we really want to make sure
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
we think about it normally this would
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
have been a bill i would have retained
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
or you know in an interim study to work
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
on it done done it right through
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but we didn't have time and
 
05:11:01.350 --> 05:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
this is a where we all feel that this is
 
05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
something we want to do now to help this
 
05:11:05.990 --> 05:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
industry out right now and that's why i
 
05:11:07.270 --> 05:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
think this is this
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:22.628 --> 05:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
05:11:24.628 --> 05:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
the the underlying bill
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
i know we're talking about the amendment
 
05:11:26.400 --> 05:11:27.430 align:start position:0%
i know we're talking about the amendment
uh

05:11:27.430 --> 05:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just not gonna
 
05:11:30.868 --> 05:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:11:31.830 --> 05:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
right now we're supposed to be talking
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
about the amendment right okay so i
 
05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
think the two-year
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
sunset clause makes a bad bill slightly
 
05:11:38.878 --> 05:11:40.310 align:start position:0%
sunset clause makes a bad bill slightly
better

05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:11:40.320 --> 05:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
better
um

05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:43.990 --> 05:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
and had i had i not thought we were
 
05:11:44.000 --> 05:11:45.190 align:start position:0%
and had i had i not thought we were
gonna

05:11:45.190 --> 05:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
not retain this bill i might have put my
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
own amendment in
 
05:11:48.240 --> 05:11:50.310 align:start position:0%
own amendment in
um

05:11:50.310 --> 05:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:51.990 --> 05:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting for the amendment but
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
against the underlying bill that's my
 
05:11:54.400 --> 05:11:55.430 align:start position:0%
against the underlying bill that's my
position

05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:11:55.440 --> 05:11:56.628 align:start position:0%
position
okay

05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:11:58.070 --> 05:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i'll speak to that when the bill
 
05:11:59.590 --> 05:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the bill fair
 
05:11:59.600 --> 05:12:00.390 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the bill fair
enough

05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
enough
 
05:12:02.310 --> 05:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh so representative abel did you want
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
to speak again
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
nope okay and representative van
 
05:12:06.718 --> 05:12:08.390 align:start position:0%
nope okay and representative van
houghton

05:12:08.390 --> 05:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
houghton
 
05:12:09.430 --> 05:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:09.440 --> 05:12:10.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:12.550 --> 05:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
first of all just a quick point of order
 
05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'm always confused as to how things go
 
05:12:16.628 --> 05:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
when we have two or more amendments
 
05:12:18.708 --> 05:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
um could you re repeat that process for
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
me please okay so we have this first
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that we we're going to take up
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
um if it were to pass
 
05:12:28.390 --> 05:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
we still can take up you know we still
 
05:12:30.470 --> 05:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
can have someone then bring in the
 
05:12:31.990 --> 05:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
second amendment
 
05:12:35.190 --> 05:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
and at that point time it would replace
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
that portion of the first amendment
 
05:12:38.628 --> 05:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
which was the
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:57.030 --> 05:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
normal conditions we would have a third
 
05:12:57.040 --> 05:12:58.470 align:start position:0%
normal conditions we would have a third
amendment

05:12:58.470 --> 05:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:13:01.110 --> 05:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know drawn up to reflect exactly
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
what you
 
05:13:04.390 --> 05:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
want you know there would it's always
 
05:13:07.110 --> 05:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
best to adopt one amendment but in this
 
05:13:10.230 --> 05:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
case i think if everybody is is really
 
05:13:12.470 --> 05:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
clear on what you're doing
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
um with the
 
05:13:15.430 --> 05:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:13:17.510 --> 05:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
sunset clause and the amendment and
 
05:13:19.590 --> 05:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
since it's a nice simple amendment with
 
05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
with one or two pieces
 
05:13:23.430 --> 05:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
i think we can make it clear and then
 
05:13:26.550 --> 05:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
what will happen is a single amendment
 
05:13:28.390 --> 05:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
that you don't have before you will be
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
created and there will be in the house
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
calendar you know sort of this go
 
05:13:32.320 --> 05:13:33.270 align:start position:0%
calendar you know sort of this go
forward

05:13:33.270 --> 05:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
one amendment that that has
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
whatever you
 
05:13:38.788 --> 05:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
all vote on
 
05:13:40.948 --> 05:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
it contained in it so in the end there
 
05:13:43.030 --> 05:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
will be one amendment
 
05:13:44.470 --> 05:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
that is correct doesn't have to be
 
05:13:46.868 --> 05:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
either of these it could be in a
 
05:13:46.878 --> 05:13:48.470 align:start position:0%
either of these it could be in a
uh

05:13:48.470 --> 05:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think the concept is you would but you
 
05:13:50.160 --> 05:13:50.948 align:start position:0%
i think the concept is you would but you
would

05:13:50.948 --> 05:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:13:52.628 --> 05:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
potentially adopt both of these
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendments and therefore you would need
 
05:13:56.948 --> 05:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
a third amendment that combines the two
 
05:13:56.958 --> 05:13:58.150 align:start position:0%
a third amendment that combines the two
ideas

05:13:58.150 --> 05:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
05:13:59.830 --> 05:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
and who decides what that third
 
05:14:02.708 --> 05:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
amendment will contain you have to pass
 
05:14:05.110 --> 05:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
both of them to make that happen
 
05:14:06.628 --> 05:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
but we would want to be
 
05:14:09.430 --> 05:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
extremely clear that everybody agreed on
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
what that
 
05:14:13.110 --> 05:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
what you were doing so and i think it
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
the prospective repeal plus it sounds
 
05:14:20.470 --> 05:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
like 60 days
 
05:14:24.550 --> 05:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:27.110 --> 05:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay may i just
 
05:14:27.120 --> 05:14:28.390 align:start position:0%
okay may i just
clarify

05:14:28.390 --> 05:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
05:14:31.110 --> 05:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
my mind which is not at all clear
 
05:14:31.120 --> 05:14:32.550 align:start position:0%
my mind which is not at all clear
um

05:14:32.550 --> 05:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:35.110 --> 05:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think that i really do believe that
 
05:14:36.788 --> 05:14:36.798 align:start position:0%
the relief needs to be soon i don't like
 
05:14:39.510 --> 05:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
the sunset clause but i do believe that
 
05:14:39.520 --> 05:14:40.788 align:start position:0%
the sunset clause but i do believe that
um

05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:43.350 --> 05:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
i will vote against my own amendment
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
in order to provide immediate relief
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
for those people who need that relief um
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know how else to do it because i
 
05:14:52.868 --> 05:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
like one piece and i don't like the
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
other piece but i don't want people to
 
05:14:56.310 --> 05:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
suffer because i'm falling on my
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
philosophical sword you know you can
 
05:14:59.910 --> 05:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
withdraw it
 
05:15:01.990 --> 05:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
i hear but now right now we're talking
 
05:15:03.270 --> 05:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
the first amendment right now we haven't
 
05:15:05.830 --> 05:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
taken her amendment up yet okay but i
 
05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
just i if nothing else i want to show
 
05:15:09.350 --> 05:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
everybody this is exactly the reason why
 
05:15:11.910 --> 05:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
i like things being done in subcommittee
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
so that these issues are sorted out long
 
05:15:15.510 --> 05:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
before we get to the full committee and
 
05:15:17.190 --> 05:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
take these things up
 
05:15:19.190 --> 05:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
and so normally my normal nature would
 
05:15:21.110 --> 05:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
have been to retain this bill but
 
05:15:23.750 --> 05:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
because we all have a sense of urgency
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
05:15:27.270 --> 05:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
passing upon
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
upon passage and having us a chance to
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
have a revisit i think is is a win-win
 
05:15:34.638 --> 05:15:35.510 align:start position:0%
have a revisit i think is is a win-win
okay

05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:15:40.628 --> 05:15:40.638 align:start position:0%

the first amendment is the sunset or the
 
05:15:48.160 --> 05:15:49.030 align:start position:0%
the first amendment is the sunset or the
uh

05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
the initial date the first amendment has
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
two things in it it has
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
upon passage
 
05:15:59.990 --> 05:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
yep and the sunset
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment that's justin
 
05:16:03.030 --> 05:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's in the first amendment that's the
 
05:16:05.110 --> 05:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
amount we're discussing
 
05:16:05.120 --> 05:16:06.550 align:start position:0%
amount we're discussing
yes

05:16:06.550 --> 05:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's the bartlett amendment that you
 
05:16:10.830 --> 05:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry call coming in at the
 
05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
same time hey um so i'm probably in the
 
05:16:25.750 --> 05:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
same boat as my twin representative
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
ammon over there
 
05:16:30.390 --> 05:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
but i do think this sunset is a smart
 
05:16:30.400 --> 05:16:31.590 align:start position:0%
but i do think this sunset is a smart
idea

05:16:31.590 --> 05:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know the problems that we are seeing
 
05:16:37.590 --> 05:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
in this particular industry are are
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
the result of or if not greatly
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by the pandemic
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
anytime you have a
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
exogenous shock to a system like this
 
05:16:49.110 --> 05:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
people are going to be scrambling to try
 
05:16:51.990 --> 05:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
to to fill to fill the holes and fulfill
 
05:16:55.110 --> 05:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
those customers needs um
 
05:16:56.708 --> 05:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:16:59.350 --> 05:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
i i think we'll find that um you know as
 
05:17:01.750 --> 05:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
things smooth out as uh
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
experienced as these delivery companies
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
become more experienced and
 
05:17:12.628 --> 05:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
providing these services
 
05:17:14.230 --> 05:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
these kinds of issues are going to
 
05:17:16.390 --> 05:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
smooth themselves out over time
 
05:17:18.868 --> 05:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
and this temporary fix that we're
 
05:17:20.628 --> 05:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
putting in there should
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
should really only need to be temporary
 
05:17:22.798 --> 05:17:23.830 align:start position:0%
should really only need to be temporary
um

05:17:23.830 --> 05:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
and i think we'll find as time goes on
 
05:17:28.390 --> 05:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
that having contracts between
 
05:17:29.590 --> 05:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:17:31.430 --> 05:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
delivery companies and the restaurants
 
05:17:33.270 --> 05:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
is not
 
05:17:34.470 --> 05:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
really going to be
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
the solution that everyone thinks is
 
05:17:37.110 --> 05:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
as an example i i do all the customer
 
05:17:41.190 --> 05:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
service for a
 
05:17:44.708 --> 05:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
a very large national restaurant chain
 
05:17:47.750 --> 05:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
we process uh over 10 000 customer
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
interactions a day
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
and every single negative interaction we
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
have is because of the delivery service
 
05:17:56.868 --> 05:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
that they use
 
05:17:59.110 --> 05:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
and they do have a contract with them
 
05:18:00.628 --> 05:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
and it's it's one you have heard of
 
05:18:00.638 --> 05:18:02.310 align:start position:0%
and it's it's one you have heard of
before

05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:18:02.320 --> 05:18:03.350 align:start position:0%
before
so

05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:18:03.360 --> 05:18:04.948 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:18:04.948 --> 05:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:06.868 --> 05:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
just again so look look for that in the
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
future for this problem to be continued
 
05:18:12.708 --> 05:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
even when contracts are in place
 
05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's really you know it gets to but to
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
my initial response is that we to force
 
05:18:21.110 --> 05:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
people to be in a contract a contract to
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
force businesses to do a contract is is
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
an anathema to my nature um so
 
05:18:28.868 --> 05:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
and anyway
 
05:18:31.590 --> 05:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh any more discussion on the motion
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
to ought to pass on the bartlett
 
05:18:33.680 --> 05:18:36.230 align:start position:0%

motion

05:20:54.230 --> 05:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:20:55.830 --> 05:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:20:57.270 --> 05:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative hunt second by
 
05:21:00.230 --> 05:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative patousek um ought to pass
 
05:21:04.150 --> 05:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:07.110 --> 05:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on the motion
 
05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
is your hand up represent ammon to this
 
05:21:09.120 --> 05:21:09.910 align:start position:0%
is your hand up represent ammon to this
guy

05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
guy
 
05:21:13.030 --> 05:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i just like to say uh get on my
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
soapbox a little bit here
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
when we see a
 
05:21:21.830 --> 05:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
problem in society our first reaction
 
05:21:23.830 --> 05:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
should not be to create a violation and
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
a fine for that problem
 
05:21:29.350 --> 05:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
um i think an intermediary step would be
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
to allow for more information to flow
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
into the marketplace so that people can
 
05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
make better decisions so for instance
 
05:21:40.390 --> 05:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
if you're a restaurant serving take out
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
you can't tell who comes in
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
as a customer or who comes in as a door
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
dash driver so
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
one idea would be to make them wear some
 
05:21:51.670 --> 05:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
kind of identifying mark
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
so the costs of the restaurant would be
 
05:21:55.670 --> 05:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
able to decide whether or not to serve
 
05:21:58.550 --> 05:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
that person or serve that company
 
05:22:00.230 --> 05:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
and then require
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
notification on websites right
 
05:22:03.120 --> 05:22:04.310 align:start position:0%
notification on websites right
um

05:22:04.310 --> 05:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:07.190 --> 05:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
this bill creates a violation
 
05:22:10.708 --> 05:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollar fine for each violation
 
05:22:12.150 --> 05:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
without an agreement
 
05:22:15.670 --> 05:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
and there's no discussion of enforcement
 
05:22:17.590 --> 05:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
very little i i don't remember
 
05:22:19.510 --> 05:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
much discussion about enforcement what
 
05:22:21.590 --> 05:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
happened how do you prove
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh that the client
 
05:22:26.070 --> 05:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
or you know the customer received the
 
05:22:27.830 --> 05:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
the end customer receiving the sandwich
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
or the burrito or whatever it is
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
how do they
 
05:22:34.628 --> 05:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
report a violation or even know there is
 
05:22:37.350 --> 05:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
a violation to report so i think this is
 
05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
a knee-jerk reaction to a real problem
 
05:22:40.798 --> 05:22:41.670 align:start position:0%
a knee-jerk reaction to a real problem
um

05:22:41.670 --> 05:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:44.708 --> 05:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
and this type of reaction happens way
 
05:22:47.190 --> 05:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
too often in the legislature so i'm
 
05:22:49.110 --> 05:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
going to be voting against all to pass
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
with the amendment and
 
05:22:54.470 --> 05:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
those are my reasons so thank you
 
05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
fair enough um
 
05:22:58.550 --> 05:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
obviously that's
 
05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
why i was urging for the sunset is so we
 
05:23:03.430 --> 05:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
can revisit all these pieces
 
05:23:08.150 --> 05:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i just want to
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
remind people that um one of the
 
05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
individuals that testified
 
05:23:16.550 --> 05:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
was tom boucher
 
05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
who owned several restaurants the
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
t-bones and cactus cactus jacks and he
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
was in support of this bill he has over
 
05:23:25.750 --> 05:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
a thousand employees so there definitely
 
05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
is an issue he did take enforcement
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
because he's he did hire an attorney
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
because this was happening uh to him and
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
he won because he was able to afford an
 
05:23:36.788 --> 05:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
attorney so um you know i'm going to go
 
05:23:38.788 --> 05:23:38.798 align:start position:0%
with this bill i'm going to vote to look
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
odd to pass because it's much needed
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
05:23:44.708 --> 05:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
is any more discussion on the motion
 
05:23:46.868 --> 05:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
about to pass as amended
 
05:23:55.590 --> 05:23:55.600 align:start position:0%

18 to you
 
05:25:42.628 --> 05:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
would it be a minority report
 
05:25:42.638 --> 05:25:43.990 align:start position:0%
would it be a minority report
representative

05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:25:46.628 --> 05:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh if i had more time i would but i'm
 
05:25:49.030 --> 05:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
going to let this one slide okay
 
05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh do you want to leave it on the
 
05:25:51.990 --> 05:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
regular calendar rather than
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:56.240 --> 05:25:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:25:59.190 --> 05:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i think let's do that that'll be a
 
05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
good compromise okay
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we got one bill left and
 
05:26:09.510 --> 05:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
a half hour hour
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
neato's rig how long does it take you to
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
get to get your vaccine
 
05:26:17.670 --> 05:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
um i've already figured that in
 
05:26:18.868 --> 05:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
i don't have to be there all three
 
05:26:20.390 --> 05:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
fifteen so if i
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
sign up for three get in my car i'm good
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
all right i was sure sorry forgot it was
 
05:26:27.510 --> 05:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
your team right okay
 
05:26:30.628 --> 05:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh so the last bill house bill 618 poly
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
stream packaging
 
05:26:33.830 --> 05:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative abramson seconded by
 
05:26:35.350 --> 05:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative patusek moves in
 
05:26:37.590 --> 05:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative abramson is recognized to
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
speak to his motion
 
05:26:43.110 --> 05:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh so here's
 
05:26:45.430 --> 05:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
the reason that i um
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
decided to move and expedient to
 
05:26:49.430 --> 05:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
legislate um the bill on the surface
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
says it would ban polystyrene but it
 
05:26:54.150 --> 05:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't ban the replacement when you
 
05:26:56.230 --> 05:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
have a container of eggs if they can't
 
05:26:58.470 --> 05:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
use polystyrene they use plastic or
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
paper or cardboard
 
05:27:02.230 --> 05:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
when you're
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
serving food or have seconds or get
 
05:27:06.948 --> 05:27:06.958 align:start position:0%
something at the deli or the the soup
 
05:27:06.958 --> 05:27:08.070 align:start position:0%
something at the deli or the the soup
kitchen

05:27:08.070 --> 05:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
instead of using if you're not using
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
polystyrene you're using thick
 
05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh plastic which may not even be
 
05:27:13.680 --> 05:27:14.948 align:start position:0%
uh plastic which may not even be
recyclable

05:27:14.948 --> 05:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
recyclable
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh when you have a to-go box from the
 
05:27:19.990 --> 05:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant um to get the same insulating
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
effect you need a lot of cardboard and
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
it costs it doesn't just cost a lot more
 
05:27:26.548 --> 05:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
it's a lot more material or for for a
 
05:27:28.548 --> 05:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
cup at the coffee shop it's not just the
 
05:27:31.750 --> 05:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
plastic lid and the thick paper cup the
 
05:27:33.430 --> 05:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
cardboard sleeve
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
the black and green ink that they
 
05:27:38.868 --> 05:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
you invariably use with paper and
 
05:27:41.670 --> 05:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
cardboard uh which is is toxic when it
 
05:27:43.350 --> 05:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
ends up in landfills and then leeches
 
05:27:43.360 --> 05:27:44.150 align:start position:0%
ends up in landfills and then leeches
out

05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:27:44.160 --> 05:27:45.350 align:start position:0%
out
um

05:27:45.350 --> 05:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:45.360 --> 05:27:46.150 align:start position:0%
um
i

05:27:46.150 --> 05:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
i i viewed this as an either ore and
 
05:27:50.948 --> 05:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
although i'm not a i'm not a big fan of
 
05:27:53.910 --> 05:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
polystyrene in general it's
 
05:27:57.030 --> 05:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's either this or every other
 
05:27:59.270 --> 05:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
type of material that gets used and
 
05:28:00.708 --> 05:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of there's obviously a lot
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
of polystyrene that's that's in
 
05:28:02.558 --> 05:28:03.830 align:start position:0%
of polystyrene that's that's in
inventory

05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
that instead of uh you know sitting
 
05:28:09.030 --> 05:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
around in uh closets and cupboards and
 
05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
just disappearing or evaporating it
 
05:28:14.070 --> 05:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
would have to go out to other states
 
05:28:16.230 --> 05:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
um because you couldn't use it anymore
 
05:28:17.990 --> 05:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh so i
 
05:28:20.548 --> 05:28:20.558 align:start position:0%
i understand what the with the uh bill
 
05:28:22.470 --> 05:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor is trying to get to she's
 
05:28:25.510 --> 05:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh uh the landfills
 
05:28:28.548 --> 05:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
filling up but if you replace these very
 
05:28:30.470 --> 05:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
useful polystyrene containers with
 
05:28:32.708 --> 05:28:32.718 align:start position:0%
something else usually end up requiring
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
heavier or additional material with
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
something else it doesn't just cost more
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
to use these alternatives
 
05:28:41.030 --> 05:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's more material and most of the
 
05:28:43.510 --> 05:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
alternative materials uh using
 
05:28:45.510 --> 05:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
polystyrene containers almost never have
 
05:28:48.150 --> 05:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
inks or dyes it and it's those types of
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
toxic toxic green ink that i was most
 
05:28:52.788 --> 05:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
concerned about that's why i decided uh
 
05:28:54.948 --> 05:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
to itl for not just cost but
 
05:28:57.270 --> 05:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
environmental reasons
 
05:28:59.510 --> 05:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh first up is representative
 
05:28:59.520 --> 05:29:03.430 align:start position:0%
okay uh first up is representative
herbert

05:29:03.430 --> 05:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman hunt i am
 
05:29:09.830 --> 05:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:12.868 --> 05:29:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:16.628 --> 05:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
because we're drowning in this crap and
 
05:29:18.548 --> 05:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
we have to get rid of it we're going to
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
have to stop using a lot of things
 
05:29:23.590 --> 05:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
this being just one
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
so i mean we don't have a choice in the
 
05:29:28.628 --> 05:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
matter we're going to have to do it so i
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a time to long past time to
 
05:29:31.920 --> 05:29:32.708 align:start position:0%
think it's a time to long past time to
uh

05:29:32.708 --> 05:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:29:35.590 --> 05:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
we passed the threshold a long time ago
 
05:29:38.390 --> 05:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
we've got some deep digging to do
 
05:29:40.070 --> 05:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
and i want to start it as soon as
 
05:29:40.080 --> 05:29:42.230 align:start position:0%
and i want to start it as soon as
possible

05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:29:47.590 --> 05:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
sorry i was expecting to be called a
 
05:29:51.110 --> 05:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
little bit later down the line there
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh i i'm i'm
 
05:29:57.590 --> 05:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually in in uh in favor of uh of
 
05:29:59.590 --> 05:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
itling this spill i don't think we need
 
05:30:01.350 --> 05:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
to actually ban
 
05:30:04.150 --> 05:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh polystyrene containers it's not just
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
the to go containers polystyrene is used
 
05:30:08.788 --> 05:30:08.798 align:start position:0%
in all kinds of of applications go to
 
05:30:10.708 --> 05:30:10.718 align:start position:0%
your meat market or your grocery store
 
05:30:12.788 --> 05:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
and buy meat and you'll find a a little
 
05:30:15.910 --> 05:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
plastic a styrofoam tray
 
05:30:17.350 --> 05:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
and that is proven to be a very
 
05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
effective means you'd be getting rid of
 
05:30:19.910 --> 05:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
that what are you going to put the food
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
on now but even more importantly than
 
05:30:22.240 --> 05:30:23.430 align:start position:0%
on now but even more importantly than
that

05:30:23.430 --> 05:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:30:26.230 --> 05:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
i think science is actually presenting a
 
05:30:29.190 --> 05:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
solution to all the landfill and all the
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
all the issues for uh
 
05:30:33.990 --> 05:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
for polystyrene and plastics and stuff
 
05:30:34.948 --> 05:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
in what mit
 
05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
is uh has been studying in the effect of
 
05:30:44.788 --> 05:30:44.798 align:start position:0%
light uh on on polystyrene and plastics
 
05:30:46.390 --> 05:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
i think there is a machine that somebody
 
05:30:48.788 --> 05:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
a brilliant mind at mit is is is
 
05:30:50.788 --> 05:30:50.798 align:start position:0%
prepared to invent that will just
 
05:30:53.830 --> 05:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
bombard plastic since polystyrene uh
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
with with the uv and the and the visible
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
light and break it down right now the
 
05:31:00.390 --> 05:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
science is saying if you just leave it
 
05:31:02.070 --> 05:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
out in nature it might take a hundred
 
05:31:04.788 --> 05:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
years as opposed to a thousand years
 
05:31:06.628 --> 05:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
great that's great put it in a machine
 
05:31:08.310 --> 05:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
and bombard it it might only take a day
 
05:31:10.150 --> 05:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
and a half i don't know what what it is
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
but certainly there is a a brilliant
 
05:31:14.310 --> 05:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
mind who's ready to use
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
and develop a machine that will take
 
05:31:17.670 --> 05:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
care of that i think science gave us the
 
05:31:19.350 --> 05:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
polystyrene container and science will
 
05:31:22.470 --> 05:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
solve the problem
 
05:31:27.110 --> 05:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
05:31:32.070 --> 05:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative greeson just
 
05:31:32.080 --> 05:31:33.270 align:start position:0%
representative greeson just
mentioned

05:31:33.270 --> 05:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
05:31:37.430 --> 05:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
meat counters and how the meat is um
 
05:31:39.190 --> 05:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
sold um
 
05:31:42.548 --> 05:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
on this phone and in europe they have
 
05:31:45.270 --> 05:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
adopted alternative um
 
05:31:48.070 --> 05:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
ways of doing business regarding uh
 
05:31:50.628 --> 05:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
these styrofoam products
 
05:31:52.868 --> 05:31:52.878 align:start position:0%
is they bring their own recycled
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
containers to the meat counters
 
05:31:58.708 --> 05:31:58.718 align:start position:0%
and to the restaurants so that they can
 
05:31:59.990 --> 05:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
take home
 
05:32:02.948 --> 05:32:02.958 align:start position:0%
um their meat or their chico's in their
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
own recycled containers
 
05:32:07.750 --> 05:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:32:10.868 --> 05:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
reusable containers
 
05:32:10.878 --> 05:32:11.830 align:start position:0%
reusable containers
perfect

05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
05:32:14.788 --> 05:32:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh okay representative bartlett
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:32:17.750 --> 05:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
well i'd like to address a couple of
 
05:32:17.760 --> 05:32:18.390 align:start position:0%
well i'd like to address a couple of
things

05:32:18.390 --> 05:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:32:21.430 --> 05:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
one is uh regarding inventory this pilot
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
siren containers take up a lot of room
 
05:32:26.788 --> 05:32:26.798 align:start position:0%
and this bill would not even be
 
05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
effective until january the first
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
so there's plenty of time to get rid of
 
05:32:34.150 --> 05:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
any inventory that might be there
 
05:32:37.590 --> 05:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
another issue was that um
 
05:32:39.270 --> 05:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
there was concern about
 
05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
these trays being used for meats and
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
fish and things those are exempted in
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
the bill there's a number of exemptions
 
05:32:48.070 --> 05:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
on page
 
05:32:48.080 --> 05:32:49.030 align:start position:0%
on page
two

05:32:49.030 --> 05:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:32:50.708 --> 05:32:50.718 align:start position:0%
that talks about things that would
 
05:32:53.190 --> 05:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
continue to be used for the time being
 
05:32:53.200 --> 05:32:55.030 align:start position:0%
continue to be used for the time being
um

05:32:55.030 --> 05:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:55.040 --> 05:32:56.948 align:start position:0%
um
three

05:32:56.948 --> 05:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
i think that we really have got to
 
05:33:01.270 --> 05:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
address plastics there are a lot of
 
05:33:03.350 --> 05:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
different kinds of plastics
 
05:33:03.360 --> 05:33:04.150 align:start position:0%
different kinds of plastics
um

05:33:04.150 --> 05:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:06.150 --> 05:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
these polystyrene
 
05:33:08.470 --> 05:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
um containers i'm i'm certainly hoping
 
05:33:10.390 --> 05:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
that they will be broken down at some
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
point but right now the half light on
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
them half-life on them is very long
 
05:33:15.840 --> 05:33:16.708 align:start position:0%
them half-life on them is very long
and

05:33:16.708 --> 05:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:18.868 --> 05:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
they're getting involved they they break
 
05:33:21.030 --> 05:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
down when they break down they the
 
05:33:21.040 --> 05:33:22.548 align:start position:0%
down when they break down they the
wildlife

05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
ingest it we
 
05:33:27.510 --> 05:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
can also ingest it these plastics are
 
05:33:28.548 --> 05:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
not good
 
05:33:28.558 --> 05:33:29.430 align:start position:0%
not good
and

05:33:29.430 --> 05:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:31.830 --> 05:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
for many many years we did not have to
 
05:33:34.708 --> 05:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
use polystyrene
 
05:33:38.788 --> 05:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
it's full of fossil based fuels and we
 
05:33:41.750 --> 05:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that we have got to start
 
05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
moving away from them and this bill
 
05:33:46.708 --> 05:33:46.718 align:start position:0%
is a start it's only a start there's
 
05:33:48.150 --> 05:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
plenty of polystyrene that would
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
continue to be used
 
05:33:49.920 --> 05:33:50.948 align:start position:0%
continue to be used
but

05:33:50.948 --> 05:33:50.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:33:52.868 --> 05:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
alternatives would would start to be
 
05:33:52.878 --> 05:33:53.910 align:start position:0%
alternatives would would start to be
offered

05:33:53.910 --> 05:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
offered
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
so i cannot um i certainly would
 
05:34:00.548 --> 05:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
be looking for the motion of otp
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'd just like to
 
05:34:08.310 --> 05:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
point out um
 
05:34:10.310 --> 05:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
a major reason why i would be interested
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
in an otp motion should one come uh to
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
the table
 
05:34:16.150 --> 05:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
is uh is in the bill itself this is
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
simply enabling legislation the bill
 
05:34:20.070 --> 05:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
itself and i'm reading from the bill
 
05:34:22.150 --> 05:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities shall have the sole
 
05:34:24.628 --> 05:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
authority under this subdivision to
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
regulate implement and enforce the
 
05:34:29.910 --> 05:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
prohibition on polystyrene foam food
 
05:34:32.070 --> 05:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
service products we are allowing the
 
05:34:34.150 --> 05:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities the ability to govern
 
05:34:36.390 --> 05:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
themselves to decide what works best for
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
them in terms of this issue perhaps a
 
05:34:40.470 --> 05:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
very small town
 
05:34:41.830 --> 05:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
we'll look at this very differently
 
05:34:43.430 --> 05:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps their use is very minimal
 
05:34:45.910 --> 05:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
compared to say a manchester which is
 
05:34:47.910 --> 05:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
where i reside so i think it's important
 
05:34:49.430 --> 05:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
to realize that we are not actually
 
05:34:51.910 --> 05:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
doing anything for polystyrene per se we
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
are allowing localities to make their
 
05:34:56.948 --> 05:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:00.070 --> 05:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent patusik
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair
 
05:35:05.030 --> 05:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh if memory serves
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of sessions ago there was a law
 
05:35:12.070 --> 05:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
something like this against plastic bags
 
05:35:14.868 --> 05:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
and we know what happens to plastic bags
 
05:35:17.830 --> 05:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
when covered 19 hit you could not use
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
any recyclable bags so
 
05:35:22.868 --> 05:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
i would say in this case be careful of
 
05:35:24.548 --> 05:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
what you asked for
 
05:35:27.270 --> 05:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
also a second thing i heard that they
 
05:35:29.430 --> 05:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
are allowing
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
people to bring in
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
their own styrofoam recyclable
 
05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
things in europe to be reused that has
 
05:35:42.708 --> 05:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
the same sanitary problems as recyclable
 
05:35:42.718 --> 05:35:44.070 align:start position:0%
the same sanitary problems as recyclable
growlers

05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
growlers
 
05:35:46.310 --> 05:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
in the united states as the bill that we
 
05:35:47.670 --> 05:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
didn't pass
 
05:35:49.190 --> 05:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
and lastly
 
05:35:51.910 --> 05:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about our small businesses
 
05:35:53.750 --> 05:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
having to pay
 
05:35:56.390 --> 05:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
twice or three times the amount of what
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
they're paying now
 
05:36:01.030 --> 05:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
and still being in the hole
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get out of the hole through
 
05:36:05.510 --> 05:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
05:36:07.670 --> 05:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
thing that we're in until the end of the
 
05:36:07.680 --> 05:36:09.510 align:start position:0%
thing that we're in until the end of the
year

05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:36:12.070 --> 05:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to be buying
 
05:36:12.080 --> 05:36:13.030 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to be buying
new

05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
new
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
items to replace polystyrene which is
 
05:36:19.030 --> 05:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
dirt cheap right now and still try to
 
05:36:20.708 --> 05:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
make a profit
 
05:36:23.110 --> 05:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
okay so i wouldn't remind everybody this
 
05:36:27.190 --> 05:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
not to confuse the two words recyclable
 
05:36:28.788 --> 05:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
and reusable
 
05:36:31.830 --> 05:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
there are two different concepts
 
05:36:34.070 --> 05:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay so i see himself but i i think
 
05:36:36.070 --> 05:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
you've all spoken already to do people
 
05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
want to speak again as representative
 
05:36:40.150 --> 05:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
bartlett would like to speak thank you
 
05:36:42.948 --> 05:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
mr chair um yes i just wanted to um
 
05:36:45.990 --> 05:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
point out that during the pandemic
 
05:36:47.910 --> 05:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire grocers association
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
was very
 
05:36:52.788 --> 05:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:52.798 --> 05:36:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
forceful

05:36:53.910 --> 05:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
forceful
 
05:36:56.310 --> 05:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
in their
 
05:36:59.030 --> 05:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
promotion that only new plastic bags
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
could be used and people couldn't use
 
05:37:02.708 --> 05:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
bags there had no there was no
 
05:37:02.718 --> 05:37:03.910 align:start position:0%
bags there had no there was no
scientific

05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
basis from which they were doing that
 
05:37:07.670 --> 05:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
they were serving their own ends on that
 
05:37:09.590 --> 05:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
um obviously the
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
there there's very little scientific
 
05:37:13.510 --> 05:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
basis for any
 
05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
contact spread of this virus and we've
 
05:37:18.070 --> 05:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
those of us that
 
05:37:18.080 --> 05:37:19.110 align:start position:0%
those of us that
do

05:37:19.110 --> 05:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:37:21.510 --> 05:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
reuse have gone back to our own cloth
 
05:37:21.520 --> 05:37:22.948 align:start position:0%
reuse have gone back to our own cloth
bags

05:37:22.948 --> 05:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
bags
 
05:37:24.830 --> 05:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
05:37:27.910 --> 05:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative herbert did you
 
05:37:31.350 --> 05:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:34.230 --> 05:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
no okay uh representative abramson you
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
have the last word
 
05:37:35.760 --> 05:37:36.708 align:start position:0%
have the last word
um

05:37:36.708 --> 05:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if this committee last
 
05:37:42.150 --> 05:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
session got any of the plastic bag bands
 
05:37:44.310 --> 05:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
plastic straw bands and so forth but my
 
05:37:46.628 --> 05:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
committee certainly got
 
05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:53.910 --> 05:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
as i think it was in february right
 
05:37:55.590 --> 05:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
before the coronavirus
 
05:37:57.510 --> 05:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
was making its way we received a number
 
05:37:59.350 --> 05:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
of warnings not just from
 
05:38:01.670 --> 05:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh business groups but also from
 
05:38:04.230 --> 05:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
um uh private citizens and policy
 
05:38:08.070 --> 05:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
experts that diseases could spread very
 
05:38:09.590 --> 05:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
easily through
 
05:38:12.230 --> 05:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
recycling and if
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
if recycled bags are made mandatory and
 
05:38:18.868 --> 05:38:18.878 align:start position:0%
disposable single-use bags were banned
 
05:38:21.110 --> 05:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
that there would be no flexibility
 
05:38:23.270 --> 05:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
available and so it ended up being lucky
 
05:38:25.030 --> 05:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
that the governor vetoed a number of
 
05:38:27.030 --> 05:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
just in just the nick of time in some
 
05:38:28.798 --> 05:38:30.070 align:start position:0%
just in just the nick of time in some
cases

05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:38:31.350 --> 05:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
so my
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
my preference is let the marketplace
 
05:38:35.350 --> 05:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
work let individual consumers decide for
 
05:38:35.360 --> 05:38:36.390 align:start position:0%
work let individual consumers decide for
themselves

05:38:36.390 --> 05:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:38:38.470 --> 05:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
if they're if somebody is morally
 
05:38:40.150 --> 05:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
05:38:42.070 --> 05:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
polystyrene and they just insist on
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
using cardboard let you know let them go
 
05:38:46.868 --> 05:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
to a place with recycled cardboard or or
 
05:38:49.110 --> 05:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
recycled plastic or
 
05:38:50.948 --> 05:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
some other material
 
05:38:52.708 --> 05:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
it's much more effective in in my
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
experience like consumers
 
05:38:57.350 --> 05:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh bring about the change
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
and um i certainly mcdonald's got the
 
05:39:02.708 --> 05:39:02.718 align:start position:0%
message and i don't get big macs in
 
05:39:06.390 --> 05:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
styrofoam anymore i get it in cardboard
 
05:39:09.510 --> 05:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh is the question is inexpedient
 
05:39:12.310 --> 05:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
to legislate question clear
 
05:39:19.910 --> 05:39:19.920 align:start position:0%

okay yes and not to pass okay so then um
uh

05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:42:11.750 --> 05:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
just in terms of the floor session
 
05:42:14.470 --> 05:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
obviously um you know if people want to
 
05:42:15.990 --> 05:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
speak and i'll be working with you
 
05:42:17.990 --> 05:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
chrissy but obviously we want to um we
 
05:42:19.590 --> 05:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
want to kind of keep the speakers list
 
05:42:21.510 --> 05:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
down uh we want to be have the
 
05:42:23.510 --> 05:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
reputation as a committee that that
 
05:42:27.350 --> 05:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
short brief and to point and uh without
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
belaboring and putting everybody to
 
05:42:31.750 --> 05:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
sleep um and and just dragging this
 
05:42:33.430 --> 05:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
painful sessions
 
05:42:35.270 --> 05:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody's sleeping during
 
05:42:37.830 --> 05:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
this session
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
so uh that's probably true but um i
 
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't know it just feels like a nice
 
05:42:43.750 --> 05:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
carpet there you know i feel very good
 
05:42:45.670 --> 05:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
just rolling soccer
 
05:42:49.030 --> 05:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
lie down and go to sleep um so otherwise
 
05:42:50.868 --> 05:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
this is i'm pleased that we were able to
 
05:42:53.430 --> 05:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
get a comp get this done uh uh as
 
05:42:55.510 --> 05:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
quickly as we have and accomplish it i
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
realized that it it looks uh very
 
05:42:59.750 --> 05:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
foreboding when we get to september and
 
05:43:02.788 --> 05:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
october um so i would warn everybody
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
that normally we only did one day a week
 
05:43:08.788 --> 05:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
and we would have um you know uh
 
05:43:10.548 --> 05:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
subcommittees working
 
05:43:10.558 --> 05:43:11.230 align:start position:0%
subcommittees working
uh

05:43:11.230 --> 05:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and i would still be
 
05:43:16.230 --> 05:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
doing that anyway simultaneously
 
05:43:19.350 --> 05:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
but i think that we can still uh work uh
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
very efficiently and try to and get
 
05:43:23.270 --> 05:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
through all these um a lot of them will
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
be depend upon what happens with the
 
05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
senate and so this is this is just
 
05:43:29.190 --> 05:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
we're only in we're only at intermission
 
05:43:30.470 --> 05:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
for committee work
 
05:43:33.190 --> 05:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
um and we will take this up again uh in
 
05:43:35.430 --> 05:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
in april i want to remind everybody
 
05:43:37.750 --> 05:43:37.760 align:start position:0%

05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
