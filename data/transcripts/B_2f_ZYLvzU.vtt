be dealing with 10 hearings we have 10
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
hearings left we've done all 107
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
hearings and these are the last 10 of
 
00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:52.350 align:start position:0%
hearings and these are the last 10 of
that

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
107 going on to the next day which is
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
Wednesday March 6th we're going to start
 
00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
executing and of the bills of the 107
 
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
bills there are a total of 35 bills we
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
left but we're not going to hit all
 
00:14:22.509 --> 00:14:22.519 align:start position:0%

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
Friday seeing the following week as the
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
week bills have to be out of here and
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
the following week we only have two and
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
a half days and then everything has to
 
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.230 align:start position:0%
a half days and then everything has to
be

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
done we're doing pardon
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
me done with all 107 bills so basically
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be doing then on
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%

11th we're going to be carrying forward
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
executive sessions which we may have but
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
I also have set up at the beginning
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
there will be I understand a non-gain
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment for
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
10:15 so we'll have a hearing on that
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
then we're going to go into a work
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
session for the rest of that morning
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
that's on Monday we're going to be
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with because there's a number of
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
people here that have not had the
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful experience of talking about
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
merging Cooperative school
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
districts uh how to uh um apportionment
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
methods for these um how you seat
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
vacancies all that we have bills Rel to
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
all this but we're going to have to
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to have um a meeting that a
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
lot of these agreements for co-ops were
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
written back in 16 16 19 might just well
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
be 19 1959
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
1960s yeah and there's several co-ops
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
that don't even have agreements and so
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
all this comes into play and and I think
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
everybody should have that background
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
information following that we will go
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
into executive sessions in the afternoon
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
on the 11th and we will be dealing with
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps some of those Coop bills um and
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
other bills which might be hanging loose
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
that we haven't gotten to and then on
 
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
the Tuesday following on 3:12 we'll
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
clean up any remaining uh uh bills
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
there's going to be one bill which we're
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
going to probably have on that
 
00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:38.919 align:start position:0%
particular day and that's the one
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with the consolidation of higher
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
education we're waiting for a task force
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's meeting on the Fridays we meet
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
this Friday next Friday um and then that
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
other Friday uh in the afternoon and
 
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get some kind of
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
understanding do they need some help
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
from the legislature in any areas of
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
statute that may be needed and I don't
 
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
have a hot clue on that right now but
 
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
we're holding that bill right to the end
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
so that it'll be available for that
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
particular task force so that's where
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
we're going um we're coming down to the
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
end here as you can see we have when we
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
come back the Monday Tuesday Wednesday
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
and Friday and then we have the Monday
 
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
Tuesday basically to get things done on
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
that Wednesday all reports have to be in
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
by noon so that means there's going to
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
be a lot of writing of committee reports
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
and getting that done and we leave the
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
morning of that Wednesday open in case
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
there is something that comes up we have
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
to attend to it's going to be busy but
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
if we want that break at the end of the
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
month here we're going to have to really
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
address these things as I mentioned here
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
that fun and games that means we'll be
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%

the
 
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.390 align:start position:0%
the
situation

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%

00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
Personnel keeping SE keeping secrets um
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
from parents we want uh School Personnel
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%

parents follow up please yes thank you
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I'm looking particularly at
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
the part that you
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
didn't uh say in lines n and 10 and your
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh qu ell um and it concerns
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
me about the fact that you're also added
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
in there you forgot to talk about the
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
sexuality of chance services will have
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
the eff of you didn't mention that but
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's okay it's here if they encourage
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
a student to withhold from parents such
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
information so basically you're you're
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
um if a youngster is
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
questioning their mental health or
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
questioning their uh gender identity or
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
question their feelings you're saying
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
that they probably shouldn't encourage a
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
student to go to counseling or talk to
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
someone else because they have the
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
effect of encouraging student withold
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
information go see a professional
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
because that's does that that am I
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
reading that
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
right um it's just indicating that if a
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
parent contacts the school personnel and
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
asks about um the students um health or
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
sexuality or changes in related
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
Services um then the uh School personnel
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
has to tell uh the parent what's going
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
on follow Mr Cher final question yes
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
thank you well I don't read it that way
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you why because when you
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
look at in n 10 it says or encourage you
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
have the effect of encouraging a student
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
to withhold from a parent such
 
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
information that's not the school
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
teacher that's at telling the youngster
 
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
so once again if the school professional
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
is saying you know what you may want to
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
go talk to a guidance cons or mental
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
health counselor or a crisis counselor
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
um before see that's what that says you
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
can't you shouldn't do you can't
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
encourage that right right School
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
Personnel should not be encouraging uh
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
students to withhold information from
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
parents this is but that's the impact is
 
00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:47.799 align:start position:0%
you if I may Mr
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you the impact of that is
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
you're not allowing School
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
professionally trained Personnel to tell
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
a student you know what you may want to
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
go see a counseling you may want do this
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
maybe this is your first
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
step I I disagree with that
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation I I think it's uh just
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
saying um School Personnel should not be
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
telling uh student don't tell your
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
parent about this it doesn't say that so
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
not encourage to go see that says no
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
counseling not encourag wait represent
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
leus thank you Mr chair I'm done thank
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
you uh on lines on lines 12 through 15
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
is that the exception clause for uh a
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
teacher that's contacted Health and
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
Human Services or DCF regarding a
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
youngster right um they do not have to
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh discuss that with the parent if there
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
is uh the belief as is stated in here
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
reasonably prudent person would feel
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
that there was the possibility of uh
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
leus not seeing anything
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
about not being able to tell a kid they
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
can't go to counseling it says they
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
can't discourage or prohibit parent
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
notification of oh no wait it's the one
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
before that or that encourage or have
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
the effect of encouraging a student to
 
00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
withhold from a parent such information
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
I don't see where it
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
says that they can't tell them they
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
pardon me she asking me a question go
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
for the chair who who is the question to
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
the committee no uh rep Woodcock because
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
he had made a statement that I'm not
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
finding do you want to respond to that
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
you don't have to yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh my point is representative Le is that
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
that point about having the effect of
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
ENC caring the student withhold from a
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
parent such information that would say
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
to me if I say to uh my student here
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
miss miss Heath you know what maybe you
 
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
want to see the guidance before you talk
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
to your parents or maybe you want to do
 
00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
this maybe want to get some more
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
information before that would be the
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
exact same thing encouraging unless tell
 
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519 align:start position:0%
with hold I'm just saying that say you
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
can't do that so I'd be I'm very L about
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
that we have professionally trained
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
staff in the schools for that exact
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
purpose thank you Mr chair represent
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to state that I
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
understand and please correct me if I'm
 
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.430 align:start position:0%
understand and please correct me if I'm
wrong

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
the premise of this bill to suggest that
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
currently School staff are trying to
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
withhold information from parents and I
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
vigorously protest that lack of trust in
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
our trained Educators who have the
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
well-being of students first and
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
foremost represent
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm not quite sure on the specific
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation but I would like to just
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
note generally that it is entirely
 
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for school Personnel to be
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
directing students to health care
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
services including mental health
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
services without roping the parents into
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
that conversation thank
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
social work workers a therapist and the
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
health organizations are in regards to
 
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
forward are you addressing I'm asking
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
that question to
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
whoever's presented this
 
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
bill I I'm just putting in an amendment
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
to the original
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
Bill second question yes can you give us
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
an example of a direct violation that
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh I I'm not one of the sponsors I
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
point did you have another question
 
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.710 align:start position:0%
point did you have another question
represent

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
cascad well we have two members on the
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
committee that are co-sponsored so I
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
didn't know if they had the answers
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
that's all thank thank you Mr chair I
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
just wanted to do the best I can to to
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
answer that particular question because
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
my district in my town Wakefield we have
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
a Schoolboard policy that
 
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.750 align:start position:0%
a Schoolboard policy that
explicitly

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
instructs uh professionals and Educators
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
to not be honest with parents about
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
these kinds of
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
criteria Mr chair could I just have the
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
reference to that please yes just what
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
policy that policy from that District
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
what is it I'll up thank
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
you represent Tanner thank you I
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
actually have two questions one is um
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
what's a student support
 
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
form and also um how would this be
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
enforced what how can you what would you
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
see this as being How
 
00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
would how would this actually work out I
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
guess it just seems so cumbersome if if
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
I'm coaching somebody sprains their
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
ankle uh and I say to the kid uh you
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
know that's that that's looks like a
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
pretty bad sprain you might go want to
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
go see the athletic director or the a um
 
00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:26.919 align:start position:0%
athletic trainer uh before you go home
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh rather than immediately going and
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
calling the parent and saying you know
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh they sprained their ankle uh you know
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
Rush here usually it's a minor sprain um
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
would it violate this and and how would
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
you as a teacher know whether you're
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
violating this or not or how would the
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
supervisor or
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
whatever student support for First
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
Student support for representa
 
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:54.519 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you I I think if you're
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
um dealing with an injury to a student
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
um I think a parent would expect that uh
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
the school is going to act to have that
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh injury taken care of um but I I think
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
at the same point um if there is an
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
injury to a student that the school
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
should be contacting the parent about
 
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.149 align:start position:0%
should be contacting the parent about
that

00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
situation what about a student support
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
form do you know what that is it's in
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
line seven yeah that's the question is
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh on line seven there's reference to a
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
support forms
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
uh while student support forms um trying
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
to get a definition what's meant by that
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that that is in the original
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
bill yeah yeah I mean that's in the
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
original Law because the original bill
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
is changing what's involed and that's
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
no it's it's a new paragraph it's all
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
new it's all
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
new yeah further questions on the
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
amendment we're looking
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
at section two
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
here 9e yes representative Cornell so I
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
I don't understand Lance I guess I do
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
understand Lance 12 through 15 would
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
that mean that Isa Guan counselor who
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with the student and
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
have known the family for the past 15
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
years if I know that telling the parents
 
00:34:33.629 --> 00:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
is going to result in something
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
happening to that child I have to tell
 
00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:37.230 align:start position:0%
happening to that child I have to tell
them

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
anyway is that is that what that says I
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.589 --> 00:34:46.599 align:start position:0%
says so I would not have to tell
 
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
them right a reasonably prudent person
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
who believes that it would uh disclosure
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
would result in abandonment neglect or
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
abuse yeah what's the definition of a
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
person uh I think that there are many um
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
legal terms that um we have in statute
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
uh uh Beyond A Reasonable Doubt Etc um
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
that uh have
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
um a common understanding I I I don't
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
think that um a definition is um
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
required here
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
um if if there is any action um uh I I
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
think that uh um it could be determined
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
later if the person was acting prudently
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
actions further discussion represent
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
Damon thank
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
you so representative corellia if you
 
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
could please expand on what you just
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
said I'm not clear how
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
a guidance counselor or other school
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
staff would
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
clear what reasonably prudent is because
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
as I heard what you just said it would
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
be determined after the fact I mean how
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
is that staff person supposed to proceed
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
know I'll leave it the fact that um a
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
reasonbly pren parent I think if they
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
think that there is going to be abuse or
 
00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
neglect because of disclosure of
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
information um they would not have to do
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
it uh or make that
 
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.390 align:start position:0%
it uh or make that
disclosure

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
um uh you know I I think U you know what
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
is do we need a definition of uh Beyond
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
A Reasonable Doubt um anything like that
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
um you I I don't
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:08.430 align:start position:0%
um you I I don't
see

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
this I'm just trying myself to look up
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
if there's in the annotated versions
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
here under 169 C3 whether there's any
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
reference to this language
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:38:16.829 align:start position:0%
 
f

00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr chair
 
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
just a simple question of of um
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
anticipated that this information this
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
bill would apply to children attending
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
um private or sectarian schools uh for
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
which they receive an EFA would this
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
um I have to go back and look at the uh
 
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.309 align:start position:0%
um I have to go back and look at the uh
original

00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
statutes um related to uh school
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
districts um but this specifically says
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
district yes represent Miler thank you
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think one of the concerns I
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
have about this this would fall under
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
the category of it's in the eye of the
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
beholder and the vagueness of it
 
00:39:26.309 --> 00:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
because uh even if you look at the issue
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
of the prudent person
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
standard the prudent person standard is
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
also subject to
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation and what I might think
 
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.950 align:start position:0%
interpretation and what I might think
was

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
prudent another might not perceive as
 
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:39.950 align:start position:0%
prudent another might not perceive as
being

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
prudent and so this is I think this
 
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.069 align:start position:0%
prudent and so this is I think this
whole

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
section uh is is uh you know
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
subjective and what one person might
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
think is okay another person may not
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
think is okay and that's that's the
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
problem I'm having with this right here
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
here because I I do think that uh that
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
school Personnel uh I think they do try
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
to be prudent I think they do try to be
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh direct uh in protecting the privacy
 
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
of students Etc as well as dealing with
 
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
parents and this language I think just
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
kind of muddies that water of
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation of U what would be the
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
standard that would cause a School
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
employee uh to come under suspect based
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
upon a decision that they might make at
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
that particular time that they're
 
00:40:31.319 --> 00:40:33.190 align:start position:0%
that particular time that they're
involved

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
in yes represent cordelli thank you I I
 
00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
think that the term reasonable is used
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
throughout our statutes um in relation
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
to child custody um Etc um and even in
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
169 C3 um under Guardian it talks about
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
um reasonable visitation rights so you
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
know do we want to go back and uh put in
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
a definition of what visible uh excuse
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
me reasonable visitation rights are so
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable is used throughout our
 
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
statutes perent Cornell yeah I
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
reasonably prudent person is in both the
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
amendment and the original bill but in
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
this paragraph the only change in this
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is on line seven and 8 it says
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
answering questions from a parent and on
 
00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
line 22 and 2 three in the original bill
 
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
it says notifying a parent so the only
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
difference in the entire amendment is
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
those two words correct uh pretty
 
00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
much further discussion represent
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
cordello thank you Mr chair so I was
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
just looking up prudent because you know
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
the word I know what it means sort of
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
you know I'm looking up cautious
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
sensible I would hope that anyone who
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
works in a school who is supposed to
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
have the best interest of the children
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh in mind would fit be hired to fit
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
that criteria of being a reasonably
 
00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.630 align:start position:0%
that criteria of being a reasonably
prudent

00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
prudent
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
person represent leus then represent
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
Woodcock all throughout
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
law we write General law we don't write
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
specific law because we can't think of
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
every specific and if we write very
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
specific law then they tends to be
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
interpreted as if we didn't include it
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
in the list it's not
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
included and if you look at most of the
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
laws on the book they are General and
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
there are General understandings of what
 
00:42:29.559 --> 00:42:30.349 align:start position:0%
there are General understandings of what
things

00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
like I just lost the word again um re
 
00:42:42.549 --> 00:42:42.559 align:start position:0%
without a you know Reasonable Doubt
 
00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
various things like that we go through
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
all the time it's it we are told we are
 
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
to write laws
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
generally because we can't think of
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
every single specific and so we not we
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
can't say well what exactly so we have a
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
list of what does reasonably prudent
 
00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:02.839 align:start position:0%
mean what is reasonably prudent what is
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
not reasonably prudent I mean we don't
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
write law that way we write law that's
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
General that gets interpreted and that's
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we do throughout law so I
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
don't know why
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
suddenly reasonably prudent is well too
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
vague when it's as specific as any of
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
the rest of the
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
things per woodcock thank you chairman
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
but um I'd like to go back to
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell's statement uh uh
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
as a counselor and going back to uh line
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
14 and the determination that
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli made about the
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
disclosure uh where it says uh would
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
result in abuse uh if Miss Heath if she
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mind me using her again comes up
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
to me and says Mr Woodcock you know what
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
um this is happening to me or I may be
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
pregnant or I think I may be gay or
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
whatever it happens to be but please you
 
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
can't tell my parents yet CU they'll
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
kill me they're going to beat me up my
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
father beat me they not going to allow
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
that in the house I'm a good whatever I
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
happen to be so I would say based on
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
this then you know what your have best
 
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
health mental health and lack opport
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
lack of abuse to me to keep my mouth
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
shut and it seem like that sort of uh
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
the opposite of what this is saying um
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
So based on that with with that def that
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
situation be correct representative
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli they would not have to tell the
 
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
parent then or inform the parent because
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
the youngster young young my young
 
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
12-year-old friend here miss Heath would
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
be petrified of being beaten when they
 
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.870 align:start position:0%
be petrified of being beaten when they
went

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
went
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
home uh I think that that would waren
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
additional discussion with the student
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
um I think uh it would uh involve
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
knowing uh the student and uh to some
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
extent uh their history um if this
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
student has been in in the school or in
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
the class before there might be some
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
indications of uh some prior family
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
problems so I think that you know the
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
question you ask um is a requires
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
broader um information um in making that
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
determination and I think that schools
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
should probably have
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
it seemed pretty simple to me if I may
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
it seemed pretty simple I thought my
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
answer was pretty simple okay well it
 
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
sort of beat around the bush didn't
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
answer it okay let's go through
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
rep and
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'm in the child protection
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
act section 169 C3 with all the
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
definitions and throughout these
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
definitions there four pages of
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
definitions are things like compelling
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
reason uh founded report versus
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
unfounded report versus unfounded but
 
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
with reasonable concern so there's there
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
are things that are not defined
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
specifically uh but have that kind of
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
there is a A Reasonable Doubt I think
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
that they they this is the permeates
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
this that you're looking at your good
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
judgment and acting in good faith and I
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
think that that's pretty reasonable
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
interpretation of what's looking for in
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
the child abuse and child protection act
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to note that in the child
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
protection act the word suspected is
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
used you're required you're mandated to
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
report if you
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
suspect abuse neglect
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
so uh in from that line could read from
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
apparent if it is suspected that
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
disclosure would result in abuse abandon
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
or neglect um there there there's number
 
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
of ways I think what what representative
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
Cordell is saying is absolutely so that
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know if you believe if a reasonable
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
person believes that this could result
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
from communicating with that parent that
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
there will be further abuse and neglect
 
00:47:06.549 --> 00:47:06.559 align:start position:0%
and of the child obviously you don't
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
want to communicate with the parent on
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
that but on most situations the parent
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
should be informed I don't think most
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
parents would do that but there are some
 
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.510 align:start position:0%
parents would do that but there are some
that

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
do so suspected is is is a word that's
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
used right on page 166 of your books is
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose of this chapter
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
through mandatory reporting of suspected
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
instances of child abuse or
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
neglect and that's where you report to
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
proper agency represent
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
Woodcock but 51a that's a mandated
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
report which we all are in schools that
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
is after the fact that's after the fact
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
when we suspect that the a youngster has
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
been abused or neglect whatever happens
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
to be it's after the fact is not prior
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
to the fact this talks about prior to
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent Hanner
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
or or or discussion yes um so I I think
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh this this amendment and and this
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
second paragraph of the bill um is
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
that should reside in local control it
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
should be a local Schoolboard policy um
 
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
and handled at a at a local level uh
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
parent complaint should be handled first
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
at the school level or with the teacher
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
and then at the school level and then at
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
the school board and so on and when
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
there is um something like this which is
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
which is vague it's very hard as uh
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
representative Miler said it's in the
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
eye of the beholder uh you know one
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
person the parent might feel one way the
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
school might feel the other way um I
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
think that uh resolving that or or just
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
even even having this on on the books is
 
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.750 align:start position:0%
even even having this on on the books is
is

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
like not necessary number one because it
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
because schools deal with with um this
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
issue all the time and number two I
 
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:11.799 align:start position:0%
think that um there's no no way
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
to I mean I can I can see this part
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
being abused or or being so vague that
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
it could it could pop up at any time and
 
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
and when representative leus said that
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
we want vague law so that we cover
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
everything we also want laws that are
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
able to be enforced that have a
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh process to it um and and
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
this doesn't have it it it it usurps at
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
the at the state level something that
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
that happens at the local level and
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
should be taken care of at the local
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
level um and there are processes that if
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
if a person is unsatisfied with how it's
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
done at the local they can they can go
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
about that perap cordellia do you have
 
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:00.799 align:start position:0%
um further information just in terms of
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
this whole reasonably thing um you know
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
we we've had um representative dry read
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
from uh current statute um you just
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
referred representative tner to a re
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable process I I don't know about
 
00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:16.839 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not sure what a reasonable
 
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
process is what might be a reasonable
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
process to me might be different than a
 
00:50:23.789 --> 00:50:23.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable process to representative
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
drive so um you know reasonable is a
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
term that is used throughout our
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
statutes and I think to try and nitpick
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
it on uh line
 
00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
14 um is um really not uh addressing
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to accomplish with
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
this which is simply um putting in place
 
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
statute that um
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
requires uh schools to be honest with
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
parents um we've heard about that in
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
Prior legislation in the past couple of
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
terms um uh representative Bel just
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned about a policy um that has
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
been common in many school
 
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
districts um that's still evidently in
 
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
district any further discussion on the
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on the am represent Tanner
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
Tanny Terry Terry excuse me thanks Paul
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I uh as a new member of
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
the committee I I appreciate the wide
 
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
ranging uh discussion here with respect
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
to the entire language contained within
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
this uh Amendment but I but I I I
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
believe that I'm understanding that the
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
the language uh is uh essentially
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
duplicative of the language that's in
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill except because no
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
one appeared to correct representative
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
Cornell that the substantive change here
 
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
is with respect to notification or of
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
parents or asking or or responding to uh
 
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
a question that is that is posed by a
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
parent and that's the real Focus here of
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment um the burden therefore
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
being upon the parent to ask the
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
question and then the responsibility of
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
the school Personnel to respond openly
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
and honestly to that question um but
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
with the exceptions that are noted uh
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
that we've discussed uh that um that
 
00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
we've discussed um so there the change
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
here is from placing the burden upon
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
School Personnel to take the
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
initiative to notify parents of any of
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
these concerns that are uh specified in
 
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
the in the paragraph and in the bill to
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh answering honestly and forthrightly a
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
question that's posed by a parent and
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
and believing that the primary
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
relationship is between the parent and
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
the child and
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
not the school and the child and because
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
the school effectively is acting in
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
local parentice and is in an effective
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
trust relationship with the parents it
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this is an eminently
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
good sense and appropriate change to
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
make because of that relationship thank
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you further further discussion
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
are we getting there represent dry thank
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
you I'm just I'm going to go back to the
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
child protective act again and just say
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
that the primary purpose in the first
 
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph is to protect the safety of
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
the child take such action as may be
 
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
necessary to prevent the abuse or
 
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
neglect of children but I want to take
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
this back to the end here and say that
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
we're not asking a reasonably prudent
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
person to disclose or not we're asking
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
the school district to adopt or or
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
permitting the school district to about
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
policies that would permit a school
 
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
Personnel to withhold such information
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
so it would be incumbent on the school
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
district to make the policy that defined
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
what reasonably prudent means okay I
 
00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
think we've had enough discussion on
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
this right now we're going to move ahead
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%

okay uh we've had discussion on this
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill prior to this uh so I'm not going
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
to take any recommendations for motion
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
right now I'd like to have repres Tanner
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
if you would please you have two
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
amendments that you brought forward on
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
this bill one is 0499 H and this one
 
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
right just recently passed out 080 1 H
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
could you please explain uh the
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
differences and what they're they're
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
about so
 
01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:33.829 align:start position:0%
about so
04

01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
04
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
99 um
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
was determined to be non-
 
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
gerain and um it
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
was a bill that was that referenced um a
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
totally new section of of law than the
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
original Bill and that's why I believe
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
it was ruled J non Germain this this one
 
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
um references the exact section that
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
16 uh 71 originally was set to um go to
 
01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh which is 193 colon 40 uh section 4
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
and it's and it starts out the same as
 
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
as section 4 in the book violations of
 
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
this section by any educator shall and
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
not is placed in there be considered a
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
violation of the educator code of
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
conduct and uh then it has the remaining
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
language okay so it's replacing the
 
01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.230 align:start position:0%
language okay so it's replacing the
whole

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
bill so this is the bill right and it
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
just speaks to section four of 193 colon
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
40 um which was where the original Bill
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh spoke to
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:02.990 align:start position:0%
uh spoke to
that

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
so just in response you're no longer
 
01:02:11.789 --> 01:02:11.799 align:start position:0%
referencing the code ethics you're
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
referencing the code of conduct which is
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
a separate section within the
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
professional codes which was which was
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
193

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:32.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
19340 is there any other discussion
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
before I take any action here yes
 
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.710 align:start position:0%
before I take any action here yes
represent

01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
belard yes I I just wanted to I I guess
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
help clarify something because I'm not
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how this works reading it
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
there seems to be an issue here to me
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
that this seems to be saying that if the
 
01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:56.119 align:start position:0%
if an educator violates the code of
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
conduct potentially even in an egregious
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
way that would generally justify
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
employment action or a lawsuit based on
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
any number of factors that this would
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
essentially provide them with immunity
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
for that by saying that because it's in
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct it cannot be used
 
01:03:13.319 --> 01:03:15.430 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct it cannot be used
against

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
them well the confusion I have just
 
01:03:22.109 --> 01:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
so the reference to a basis for civil
 
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
liability is mentioned under the code of
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
ethics not under the code of conduct but
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
now we're seeing that
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
switch and now being under the code of
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
conduct and this code was developed with
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of hard work as a result of a task
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
force of Educators that came together
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
and worked with the Department of
 
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
Education to come up with this that came
 
01:03:48.029 --> 01:03:48.039 align:start position:0%
back for approval from jelar and it was
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
initiated initially by legislation so I
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
I see this as a significant change from
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
what we have in place represent beler
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I may respond just to
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
add on to what you were just saying um
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
there there would be a major difference
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
between something existing within a code
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
of conduct that suggests this should not
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
be used for employment action or or
 
01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
civil liability which is a suggestion
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
within the code of conduct but it would
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
be an entirely different thing to
 
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
enshrine that in law where it may in
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
fact provide a total immunity for
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
that yes yeah I think it's it's
 
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
important to note that uh to embellish a
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
bit what chairman lad
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
said that when this when the code of
 
01:04:32.589 --> 01:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
conduct was was
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
created it was created not to be a an
 
01:04:36.599 --> 01:04:37.950 align:start position:0%
created it was created not to be a an
abusive

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
abusive
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
system uh that there are other there are
 
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
other channels to challenge employee
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
Behavior Etc but that the code was
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
basically to provide a
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
guideline for how a professional
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
employee professional Educators conduct
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
themselves but it was never meant to be
 
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
a an abusive system or a liability
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
system uh and I think what uh
 
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative Court Tanner is trying to
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
do here is to basically cify the
 
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
original intent of that code which was
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
not to be an abusive kind of a system
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
like am I correct Mr chair as you as you
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
I would kindly disagree with you that um
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct is totally separate
 
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
apart from the code of
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
ethics and there's a Code of Conduct
 
01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:33.430 align:start position:0%
ethics and there's a Code of Conduct
that

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
references how it's to be used and a
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
process for where you have either a
 
01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
reprimand a suspension or the loss of
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
your teaching credential so it's to
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
address those issues which are basically
 
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
uh where they're diverging from uh
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
everything that a teacher's credential
 
01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.950 align:start position:0%
everything that a teacher's credential
speaks

01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
speaks
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
to so I I I I'm I'm a little confused
 
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
here as to why we're now bringing over
 
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
this basis for civil liability and all
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
that when it doesn't speak to in the Cod
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
of conduct to that at all it's speaking
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
to that under the code of
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
ethics and the code of ethics is not
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
what we use to administer the results
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
which can occur from the code of conduct
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
the we've been told over and over by the
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
ass professional Teachers Association
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
separate now we're trying
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
to bring it together and I I think
 
01:06:37.079 --> 01:06:38.309 align:start position:0%
to bring it together and I I think
that's

01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
um uh to me that's not acceptable yes so
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
so uh when we look at that section four
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
um on page 540 in our blue books it's
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
the the original statement was violation
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
of this section by an educator shall be
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
considered a violation of the educator
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
code of conduct that justifies
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
disciplinary sanction by the State Board
 
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.190 align:start position:0%
disciplinary sanction by the State Board
of

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
Education my amendment is addressing the
 
01:07:10.599 --> 01:07:12.190 align:start position:0%
Education my amendment is addressing the
fact

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
that the the original intent of the code
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
of conduct was never to be
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
used for disciplinary sanction for
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
things like
 
01:07:25.079 --> 01:07:26.589 align:start position:0%
things like
curriculum

01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
pedagogy it was for
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
um if you want High crimes and
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors it was for uh the the types
 
01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
of uh violations that were considered
 
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
extreme and that therefore that's why it
 
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
speaks to the code of conduct in this
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment because it's a
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
reference to this particular law and
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
it's a reference to
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
um or my attempt that this code was made
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
under good faith and it's being used now
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
as quote unquote
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
punishment a punishment factor and I
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
don't think that was the original intent
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the code and I don't think it's
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have it in this
 
01:08:15.119 --> 01:08:17.430 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have it in this
particular

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
section further discussion represent
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
leus I don't have my code book with
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
me and so I have a question as
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
to the section that talks
 
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.150 align:start position:0%
to the section that talks
about

01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.870 align:start position:0%
about
[Music]

01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
um suspension Etc is that under conduct
 
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.269 align:start position:0%
um suspension Etc is that under conduct
or

01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
ethics conduct conduct so then if we've
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
said it should not be the basis for
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
employment action but that is employment
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
action that's under the code of conduct
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
so we are by if we adopt this
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
negating the code of conduct as far as
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
what's in
 
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
correct are you asking me or I think I
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
was asking you because you had the
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
because you had the book in front of
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
you but somebody else anybody else who
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
the Cod of conduct is
 
01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:36.759 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct right by the
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
educator in terms of use of Technology
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
of use with students these categorical
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
areas are responsibility to students
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility to school and Community
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility in use of
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
technology um these are all within
 
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
ed510 so uh it's all identified there uh
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
whereas the code of ethics is is not
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with that unprofessional conduct
 
01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
it's dealing with what is
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
professional it's the opposite and so I
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
I think that you know and when we say in
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics the code of ethics
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
establishes a guidance for all School
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
personnel and is not intended to be a
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
basis for civil liability nor is it
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
designed to be a basis for employment
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
action but that's the it's guidance for
 
01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
educators what you expect with that then
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
on the other side we spell out what is
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct where then there
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
is ramification which occurs either you
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
you're you're reprimanded you're
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
suspended or you lose your teaching
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.189 align:start position:0%
suspended or you lose your teaching
credential

01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
credential
 
01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think you can mix and match
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
those things that's without you know
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
this was put together back I I remember
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
the year we put the legislation forward
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
but this was put together and it there's
 
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
a a prefixing letter here January
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
2019 which was completed and sent and
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
part of this right by Christine Brennan
 
01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
and uh commissioner edbl and it was a
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
result of teachers working many many
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
many months on on putting this all
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
together I don't think that it's wise to
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
as a result of an amendment here to all
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
of a sudden do a
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
switch Yeah that's so so ethics says
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
should not be the basis but conduct is
 
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
the basis and so if we pass this we're
 
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
saying conduct sh shall not be the basis
 
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
for that either and so we're negating
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
any um action I
 
01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.070 align:start position:0%
any um action I
represent

01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you Mr uh chairman um
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
under the code of conduct Ed
 
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.590 align:start position:0%
under the code of conduct Ed
501

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
501
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
.01 uh d uh specify unprofessional
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
conduct which justifies disciplinary
 
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
sanctions against credential
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
holders um reading further into
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
5102 um unprofessional conduct shall
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
include clude but be not limited to
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination against the student as is
 
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
specified in 354 a A1 um it goes on then
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh the same for um community members who
 
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
might be U on school property
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination against them so I think
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
that um this amendment would negate all
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
that um and be contrary to uh what is
 
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
conduct repr
 
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
belshire thank you Mr chair I I just
 
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify further and I I
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
certainly take the uh take the
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative at a word as to what the
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
intent of this is but my view is that in
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
order to accomplish what the stated
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
intent of this is line 12 would need to
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
read School personnel and shall not be
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
the sole basis for civil liability nor
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
the sole basis for employment action but
 
01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.270 align:start position:0%
the sole basis for employment action but
as

01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
written I I would assume somewhere in
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct there's a
 
01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on you know for instance
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
assaulting students and as written if a
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
teacher assaulted a student because it's
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
a violation of the code of conduct it
 
01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
would appear that this would provide
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
them total civil liabil uh immunity in
 
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
such a
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
case so represent
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I was going to
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
make this remark anyway and I think it's
 
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
particularly relevant following what
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bel just said
 
01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
this bill this amendment is specific
 
01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.510 align:start position:0%
this bill this amendment is specific
to

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
19340 and if you read carefully 19340
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 4 it says violation of
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
this section it is only talking about
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct relative to this
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
section it is not the code of conduct in
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
its entirety for everything that it
 
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.750 align:start position:0%
its entirety for everything that it
covers

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
covers
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
this okay I'm going to take a motion
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
right now I'm going to take a motion
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
from representative
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
belard thank you Mr chair I I would move
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
to um to itl on this amendment well we
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
don't have a we need a motion on the
 
01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
bill apologies I would move to I on the
 
01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
bill is there a second second we have a
 
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor to itl 1671 made by
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative beler and SE by
 
01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
per Bel would you like to speak to your
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you Mr chair and and
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
moving to the bill rather than the
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that we were just discussing
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the biggest problems I
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
see with this bill is that currently we
 
01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
already in New Hampshire law both in
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
both civil and criminal statute have law
 
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
for defamation if somebody has their
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
character defamed if they're accused of
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
something they didn't do you can you can
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
go to court they can even be criminally
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
charged under the law but what it that
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
this bill would do is it would totally
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
create a different mechanism for
 
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
somebody to Sue and receive damage is
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
based on something that does not rise to
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the level of proof
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
necessary for defamation based solely on
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
the findings of a Schoolboard hearing it
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
would totally turn our system of justice
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
regarding defamation upside down and
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
create a culture of uh fear to report
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
any possible wrongdoing by you you know
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
coming from the public and I I think
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
wrong Is there further discussion on on
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
the motion the motion is to itl further
 
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
discussion repres
 
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you I I agree with the U
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh the maker of the motion on the itl
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
motion uh but I'd also like to point out
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
that we've had discussion about this
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
with the previous Bill last week uh and
 
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.830 align:start position:0%
with the previous Bill last week uh and
this

01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
um uh bill in lines 8 88 and N in the
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
original bill um puts reflects current
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
Statute in that a school board decision
 
01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
may be appealed to the State Board of
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
Education whereas in other legislation
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
we prohibit appeal excuse me um that we
 
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
can't um uh appeal to the state board so
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
I I just find um contradictions very
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
interesting further
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Miler yeah I think
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
it's important here um to note the
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
intent of the original
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
teachers are
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
subject uh to frivolous claims by
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
parents at times and I think the intent
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill was to provide some kind of
 
01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:17.950 align:start position:0%
of this bill was to provide some kind of
a

01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
balance between being
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
subject um to public accusal by a parent
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
Visa some sense of balance that a
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
teacher has some right to also provide
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
some cross claim here I think that was
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
the original intent of the bill here now
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
not withstanding the discussion that
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
we've had on here and some issues around
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics and the code of
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
conduct but I think it's important to
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
note that that original intent was made
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
to provide some protection for the
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
instructor in the classroom to make sure
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
sure that there is no frivolous kind or
 
01:17:58.110 --> 01:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
there is an there is an option to
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
respond uh to a frivolous uh attempt on
 
01:18:06.510 --> 01:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
person and I'd like to just read one
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
point regarding the conduct uh code of
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
conduct it's Ed
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
50101 it's the purpose the purpose of a
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
code of conduct item D specify
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct which justifies
 
01:18:28.510 --> 01:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
discipl disciplinary sanctions against
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
credential holders that's what this
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
section of law is all about or of the
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
code and I I think it's important to
 
01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
keep it as it is written and with the
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
liability and all that left on the other
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
side with the code of ethics uh we're
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
mixing apples and oranges here and it
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
was when it was put together by
 
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
Educators they said the code of ethics
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
and code of conduct both separate thank

01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
1382 was yes that when we had discussed
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's the special education support for
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
military compact students 13
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
information yes there was an email that
 
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
computer oh we um they were working on
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh language from other states I don't
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
think we've gotten all of it yeah I I
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
did see that language it came in by way
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
of uh email to us
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
and I I do have some concerns about how
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
they're wording their email they're
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
saying there has to be an
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
IEP evaluation within 30 days of the
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
student arriving that's not going to be
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
so if the school receiving School
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
accepts that IEP and the IEP is
 
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
current you wouldn't have to have an
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
evaluation you could have an an
 
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
intervention meeting to move forward
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
with the current IEP you don't have to
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
go through all the testing testing
 
01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.590 align:start position:0%
go through all the testing testing
measurements

01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
measurements
 
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
again so I I do have a concern about the
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
way that's been worded in other states I
 
01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
can remember when we put the compact
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
together there were a number areas
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
within which we did not agree with
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
everything that was in the compact we
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
definitely agreed with the whole
 
01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%
intent and and where it was going but it
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
didn't measure to the way we did things
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in terms of special
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
education services you got to remember
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire we have special
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
education law that supports idea but we
 
01:23:37.229 --> 01:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
go further than it in in some
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
cases and so we reflected that time what
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
we are doing here as as our best
 
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
practice represent
 
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
leus a suggestion was made to use review
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
rather than evaluation because with a
 
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
review you don't have to do all of the
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
testing and all of that you just have to
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
look at it and say yes this still I I
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
would suggest that we get that email
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
disseminate it and hold this we don't
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
have to take action today on but there
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
is some some concern there there's part
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
of it which is fine the latter part of
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
that bill where there's responsibility
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
for if a parent wins a suit or whatever
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
the the fees are paid by Doe I have no
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
objections with that but I do have some
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
concerns about how we do it with how we
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh function in accordance with idea and
 
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
our state rule regul rules uh in law so
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure we're conforming to
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire does not necessarily
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
what New York state does Mr chair yes Mr
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
chair is it possible is it possible to
 
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
get somebody from the Department here
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
that might be able to work with us and
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
answer this question yes I I mean there
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
there's a potential I'm surprised
 
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
nobody's here because there's a
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
potential liability here on the part of
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
the department for witness uh you know
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
for cost here and would seem to me that
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
it'd be good to have somebody here that
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
can answer the content of this as well
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
as the potential liability
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
here I think that's appropriate and I
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
think what we'll also do is we'll put
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
this off when we're doing some of the
 
01:25:19.229 --> 01:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
exec of the other bills in
 
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
March and I will when I'm over there I
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
will talk to director fet on Friday when
 
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
I'm over there and I'll explain what's
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
going on and I will also take the email
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
that we got from I'll make sure that's
 
01:25:33.149 --> 01:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
forwarded everybody on the committee
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
here thank
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
you so I I my suggestion is that we we
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
not take any action on that today is
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
there concurrence from the committee on
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
you we have any other bills no we going
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.709 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
14 what was it you said
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
1014 yeah okay we also want to discuss
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
1014 this is the voter
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
registration um in high school for the
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
high school
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
1014 I I I believe that I had the letter
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
which was from d scandin and
 
01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
oh that let's get that out to everybody
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
so they can all read and what what uh is
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
bud

01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
bud
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
the other one the first shorter letter
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
comes from uh Secretary of State scandin
 
01:26:59.790 --> 01:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
and the longer one comes from the
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:21.109 align:start position:0%
 
pitch

01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:51.109 align:start position:0%
 
and4

01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:28:12.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
Mr um yeah I got my original copy I did
 
01:28:19.149 --> 01:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
not take one oh there there may be some
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
on the other side
 
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.750 align:start position:0%
on the other side
okay

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
you have to go
 
01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
now okay right right now we're just
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
doing a discussion so this is discussion
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
now okay just uh look at the first uh uh
 
01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
long letter the one that was written by
 
01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
um I got two Yeah by Mr pitch um he's
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
the general counsel assist assistant
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State um in that first
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh on the second line it say
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
everything that you're going to do in
 
01:29:01.109 --> 01:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
terms of registration must conduct it in
 
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
accordance with New Hampshire law
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
obviously that's so in the second
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph down
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
there it it says about oh Midway through
 
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side in
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
addition to the Constitutional
 
01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide equal treatment to
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
similarly situated in individuals it is
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
present a reality that political
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
officials need to consider whether
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
serving one group of Voters or
 
01:29:30.109 --> 01:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
applicants different from another will
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
be perceived as having a
 
01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.189 align:start position:0%
be perceived as having a
partisan

01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
bias and the concern there is if you're
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
in a receiving high school and you have
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
kids coming from different school
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
districts at that high school and you
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
provideed for one group with the
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
supervisor checklist coming in that
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
represents the town from which they're
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
from or the clerk comes in and but you
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
don't do it for the other towns that is
 
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
um discrimination basically where you're
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're discriminating and you're
 
01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
offering this service to
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
one but not to the
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
whole that's how I read that particular
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
you may read it
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
differently um Mr chair yes Mr chair
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
which letter were were you just
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
referring to the long one the one
 
01:30:20.189 --> 01:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
requested by Mr
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
Bourne yeah
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
back in March of2 that was uh written by
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
Bud Fitch yes so so just a just a
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
question um was the response from from
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
um from Council Fitch
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
of of
 
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
1014 is that what we're talking about
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
yeah 1014 or was it directed to another
 
01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
yeah 1014 or was it directed to another
question

01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
I would have to a ask him that I think
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
he's dealing with the issue the issue of
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
registering students at the school right
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
but 1014 doesn't doesn't address that
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
issue I mean I'm just trying to try to
 
01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
understand if now there there's other
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
ways of getting around what we're
 
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
talking about and you know as being a
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
member of the task force which is
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with Civics education would oven
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
L montain sharing that they're very
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
interested in C education and and we
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
last year as you recall we passed a bill
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
in the house senate and signed in the
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
law that there's acquired course a half
 
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
your course in Civics at the middle
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
school level and then again at the high
 
01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:37.350 align:start position:0%
school level and then again at the high
school

01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
level they see this as something that
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
can be very much integrated into that
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
instruction as far as you you as a a a
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
Civics teacher I would certainly want to
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
invite somebody from the local community
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
to come in be it the a person from the
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
supervisor checklist or the clerk or
 
01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
somebody else from the town to come in
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
and explain the process that we have in
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
place here in the state for register how
 
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
to register to to vote and that it's the
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility of everybody to to vote
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
um that's important and that could be
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
done quite easily you could have folks
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
come in just as you have many other
 
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
people invited to come into the into the
 
01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.910 align:start position:0%
people invited to come into the into the
classroom

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
um there there's some cautions here um
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
though that that I I think that need to
 
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
be addressed even though it may not be
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
written specifically to this bill I
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
think it also says that you know we're
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
going to treat all the students with
 
01:32:34.159 --> 01:32:37.229 align:start position:0%
going to treat all the students with
equal

01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity then the other one from M uh
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh Mr
 
01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:45.830 align:start position:0%
uh Mr
scanland

01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
scanland
 
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
um and it just addressed the issue that
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
you cannot you cannot take form formal
 
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
action to accept that any kind of a
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
application for registration at the
 
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
school it has to be done by the voter
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
that by committee back at the municipal
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
building and that it says a single
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
supervisor attending an event to receive
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
applications that will not be acted on
 
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
till a subsequent supervisor sessions is
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
not a public meeting of the board
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
therefore public notice and act access
 
01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
to the event are not required so if one
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
person's going to a school you don't
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
have to have public notice because it's
 
01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
not the meeting where they approve these
 
01:33:32.109 --> 01:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
applications for voting that's done back
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
at the town office I think that's what
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
they're trying to clarify in Mr scandin
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
letter represent whitcock thank you
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
chair I would agree with you
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
particularly in the last paragraph
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
because under the board director of the
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
board of supervisor so if you put from
 
01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh secretary scallan's letter on three
 
01:33:51.629 --> 01:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
and four those two paragraphs it was see
 
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
to me that that is applicable and
 
01:33:57.109 --> 01:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
allowable for a high school to hold the
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
event for example if Miss hether
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
supervisor at the author of event she
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
would take the applications back to the
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
regular board for final uh blessing if I
 
01:34:07.239 --> 01:34:08.790 align:start position:0%
regular board for final uh blessing if I
read

01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
read
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
that right but the other one I'm saying
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
if if there are other students at a
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
school that don't come underneath this
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
that that particular Town yeah but we're
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
not sure that this repres L's point was
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
valid we're not sure that this
 
01:34:25.229 --> 01:34:25.239 align:start position:0%
March 2223 letter is addressing
 
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
1617 at4 but we do know the the
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of sc's letter is addressing
 
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
1014 and it says it's okay long as the
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
board of the board of regist supervis
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
depend which title they use does it
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's how I read that well read the
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
last sentence there in paragraph three
 
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
that's addressed to Mr
 
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
Bourne it says if it is the case that a
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
high school age student students from
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
any of the involved towns go to
 
01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
different high schools and the in-person
 
01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:01.159 align:start position:0%
voter registration is offered at only
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
one the supervisors need to consider
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
this issue there are some issues that
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
need to be looked at in terms fairness
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
that's the supervisor that's not that's
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
not the you would think the school would
 
01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.679 align:start position:0%
look at it too though they may but it's
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
clear that the supervisor is going to be
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
there that's the whole point of the
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
letter of of 2020 April
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
18th Mr Sheriff yes represent Amon
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment upstairs that would
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
potentially address some of these
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
concerns I thought another person was
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
bringing the copies forward may I go get
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
yes m m Mr chair
 
01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
okay and the motion is Mr Corell I think
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's important that we know what the
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
letter that Mr Bourne wrote to the
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
attorney J it says for those reasons it
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
appears unlikely that we can provide a
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
letter with the terms you seek we don't
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
know what Mr waren was asking right of
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
the of the Secretary of State's office
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
it just we don't know what he's
 
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
answering well if you look in the last
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph from uh B Fitch you can see
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
he's really clarifying information as
 
01:36:14.719 --> 01:36:15.629 align:start position:0%
he's really clarifying information as
far

01:36:15.629 --> 01:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
as Firearms po policy if you're going to
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
do this some schools may not even allow
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
that to occur
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
but we don't know what terms he's asking
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
about I mean this goes from supervisors
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
for a different students from different
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
towns that attend to school to Firearms
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
to I I don't know what Mr borne was
 
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
asking the answer CH well the first
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
sentence absolutely says it thank you uh
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
for your efforts encouraging voter
 
01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
registration okay so this letter is
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
addressing issues associated with voter
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
registration at
 
01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
schools secondary schools yes
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
schoolid the Town eligible register to
 
01:37:16.109 --> 01:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
attend that school obligate provide to
 
01:37:19.149 --> 01:37:19.159 align:start position:0%
other out of school yeah that's what
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about represent culture
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I just had a procedural
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
question I wanted to clarify have we
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
taking up a bill yet or are we just
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
discussing we're discussing we're
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
discussing yeah M
 
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead it's if it's all right I
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
mean this may this may be a larger
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
Pandora's Box and we would think that
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
this simple bill would deal with because
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
I've been informed that we already have
 
01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
schools that are uh registering students
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
so uh in schools and so if some schools
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
you talk about discrimination if some
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
schools are in fact already doing that
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
and others don't have an opportunity to
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
do that uh you know then that could be a
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
problem and I and I think representative
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
Lane also is is on the uh election law
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh committee and I'm assuming that this
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
would also fall in the purview of that
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
particular committee um yes we were
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
surprised that we didn't get it but um I
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
can tell you that and to confirm that
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
some some schools I mean some towns and
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
cities or municipalities have go in and
 
01:38:31.149 --> 01:38:31.159 align:start position:0%
register students already they do yeah
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
we we do know that's occurring and
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's a local decision that can be done
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with your Civics
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum it can be done in conjunction
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
of a Cooperative agreement with the
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
municipality and the schools um the the
 
01:38:46.030 --> 01:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions that the question I'm raising
 
01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
is that we have a number of high schools
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
that receive students from different
 
01:38:50.159 --> 01:38:53.070 align:start position:0%
that receive students from different
municipalities

01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
and where one municipality may be doing
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
this and another may not then you get in
 
01:39:02.189 --> 01:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
in your registering at that High
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
School we're not open this is uh a
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
service that's being provided for some
 
01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
students but not all the students within
 
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
that school it's different than if
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to a district which is in
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
the same municipality like like a
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester well Manchester may even have
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
some kids coming in
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
tuition Mr Mr chair yes yeah so so thank
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
you the the um you know it's obviously
 
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's clear from the date on
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
the two letters that that the letters
 
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
were um preceded the introduction of uh
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
the bill we're talking about right now
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
so neither of these letters could have
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
contemplated um House Bill 1014 but
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1014 basically basically
 
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
directs school districts and private
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
high and private high schools to adopt
 
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
policies that um that contain two things
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
one informing students U of state
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
requirements for voter registration and
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
B providing access to and assistance
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
with um filing registration applications
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
I don't mean but I have a point of order
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
on this um I I don't believe we there
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
was any advertisement for any sort of a
 
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill I think
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
technically to be in compliance we have
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
to take a motion on this before we can
 
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
do all of this I often times have had
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
discussion and we use it also as a
 
01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
discussion opportunity for us when we
 
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
are executing bills to to have a sense
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
of where we're going sometimes it's come
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
out that we can come out with a simple
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
tweak and then come back with an
 
01:40:41.709 --> 01:40:41.719 align:start position:0%
amendment that's proper and would the
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
number of bills this is different than
 
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
many of the Committees in this house we
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
have 107 bills we've had some work
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
sessions on for other bills we're going
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
to have some training on the Cooperative
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
School District stuff but that's about
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
all the time we've had so this is why I
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
make this exception where we can have
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
discussion that's been a common
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
denominator here for years even when I
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't sharing this this particular
 
01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
group so Mr chair if I could if I could
 
01:41:18.589 --> 01:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
finish my my my remarks mhm um so so NE
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
neither letter appears to be because of
 
01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
the their dates appear to be directed at
 
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
the bill where at 10:14 that we're
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
talking about um uh right now and uh and
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
all the Bill calls for is for schools um
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh school districts and private high
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
schools to adopt policies with respect
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
to um to informing students uh of
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for voter registration and
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
providing access policies for providing
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
access to and assistance with filing uh
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
registration applications and and and
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
clearly the secretary clearly the
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
legislature has has already established
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
standards for um you know through I'm
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sure through its election law
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
committee committees that um uh that
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
apply to uh to voter registration
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
non-coercion stuff like that and uh and
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
we also have the the guidance from the
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office with respect
 
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
to how these policies might um uh might
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
impact multi- municipality school
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
districts and and private schools you
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
know we also have the School Board
 
01:42:33.629 --> 01:42:33.639 align:start position:0%
Association that uh that creates um Mo
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
draft policies that school districts
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
could adopt and this I would imagine
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
would would become uh one of those and
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh and would be informed not just by by
 
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1014 not just by the Four
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
Corners of House Bill 1014 but by other
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
laws that are in force right now with
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
respect to uh to voter registration so
 
01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719 align:start position:0%
so I I I think I guess what I'm saying
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
is is I think the two the two letters
 
01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
are good background information um
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
there's probably other state laws that
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
are also good good information to inform
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
what those policies are going to be but
 
01:43:16.109 --> 01:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
it's but uh but 1014 is really um is
 
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
really a fairness uh uh type of Bill I
 
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
think representative Myer hit it that uh
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
that some schools were already doing
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
this but not all schools and uh and to
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
be fair for all
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
165,000 um uh students that are in
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
public school districts plus another
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
15,000 students that attend private
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire that uh that
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
they that they each you know receive
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
some um um some instruction in uh in
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
this area and I I agree that I think
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
that could be done as the chair was
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
suggesting POS possibly through Civics
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum too and there's nothing in in
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
1014 that that directs it to be done one
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
way or the other way or inside or
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
outside Civics curriculum but but uh but
 
01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
that would make a lot sense I I I get
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
what you're saying but my concern is I
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
guess on the first line of all the
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
Amendments including the
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
bill each School District
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
shall that's not the way it's working in
 
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
our state right now we've heard people
 
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
discuss earlier here that local
 
01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
districts might be doing this some are
 
01:44:24.589 --> 01:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
doing some are not doing it why do we
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
have to mandate this
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
Sher in each district and private high
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
school it says they shall have policies
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
yeah shall have
 
01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.750 align:start position:0%
yeah shall have
policies

01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:44:43.149 --> 01:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
why uh wait a minute wait a minute we're
 
01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
going to tell a private school that
 
01:44:46.589 --> 01:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to have a policy
 
01:44:49.629 --> 01:44:49.639 align:start position:0%
on this when in the private school
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
holderness school they're coming from
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
place can we have representative Pell
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I two points
 
01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:06.920 align:start position:0%

one under RSA 18922 and R 18923 this is
 
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
already required um 8922 says the

01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
sections because I've been looking for
 
01:46:02.109 --> 01:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
them and I haven't been able to find
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
them but um that came up in a prior
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on a prior bill and I checked
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
with the uh chair of the State Board of
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%

1930s we don't think this is being done
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
but we will start do it uh to make that
 
01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.589 align:start position:0%
but we will start do it uh to make that
information

01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
available yes representative Pam I would
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
add that representative dry myself and
