00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
let's see two
 
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
number six
 
00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
what is it one
 
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
good question
 
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 align:start position:0%
all right six eight
 
00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
nine ten all right it looks like we're
 
00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.030 align:start position:0%
nine ten all right it looks like we're
good

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
all right task for next week is to find
 
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
out what a Purim is
 
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon
 
00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 align:start position:0%
or sit wherever you like your name tags
 
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
hey

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
all right sorry about the uh
 
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
cancellation last week
 
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
I heard the temperature in the this room
 
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 align:start position:0%
was over 90 and that would have uh
 
00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
not have been Pleasant for anybody
 
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
so uh has everyone had an opportunity to
 
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
motor proof
 
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
second second okay move by uh senator
 
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
seconded by by Senator Bradley any
 
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 align:start position:0%

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.030 align:start position:0%
comments Corrections or additions to the
minutes

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
all right seeing Nando's in favor
 
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.809 align:start position:0%
all right seeing Nando's in favor
aye

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
aye
 
00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.250 align:start position:0%
aye
opposed

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
all right we have minutes
 
00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.030 align:start position:0%
all right we have minutes
um

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin you have the reports from the
 
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
actuaries on the Amendments we sent out
 
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
a while back
 
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
if you could
 
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
present them to us we'd like to see what
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
the effects are of those
 
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Marty Carlin
 
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
um you should have all received a
 
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
document uh from Bradley
 
00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
um Greenland with uh a couple of pieces
 
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
attached in one document one the first
 
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
cover sheet is sort of a summary of the
 
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
numbers in the GRS Actuarial valuation
 
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
of the amendment than the text of the
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
actual amendment is uh brought to the
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
committee last month and then finally
 
00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
the full GRS report we thought it would
 
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 align:start position:0%
be uh more effective to organize it in
 
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
one document because if you didn't know
 
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
how to read the GRS report you wouldn't
 
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
notice skip the first seven pages and
 
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
start concentrating on it when you start
 
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
seeing the numbers and then you can kind
 
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
of read backwards from there
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
um so starting with uh 2258
 
00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:01.670 align:start position:0%
um so starting with uh 2258
um

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 align:start position:0%
used to go in numerical order uh this
 
00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
amendment changed the multiplier for all
 
00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 align:start position:0%
of the group two trb members uh to two
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
and a half percent
 
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
um so the the scale of the 2.4 2.3 2.2
 
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
2.1 went away
 
00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 align:start position:0%
um and um also had a parallel language
 
00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 align:start position:0%
so that those multipliers apply to the
 
00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 align:start position:0%
disability calculations as well
 
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
um so what what GRS you know they they
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
run these scenarios you know through
 
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
their model and apply the assumptions
 
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
for you know the demographics of the
 
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
group and and things like that and that
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
they generate their report so the class
 
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
pieces I
 
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.850 align:start position:0%
pieces I
um

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 align:start position:0%
pdf'd onto the first page here just just
 
00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 align:start position:0%
for the raw numbers but essentially if
 
00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
2258 was introduced and adopted and
 
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
signed into law with no funding at all
 
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
the employer contribution rates as a
 
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
percentage of payroll would go up that's
 
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
the first line on the top page of the
 
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
Plus 1.67 or Plus 1.57 for fire and the
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
next line there represents based on the
 
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
covered payroll
 
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.710 align:start position:0%
covered payroll
um

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
of those of that of the of group two
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
that's how much more employers would be
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
contributing and again that's that's
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
spread across all employers
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
um based on the size of their payroll
 
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
for these respective groups so it's it's
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
a proportional cost the total 8.9
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
million obviously we knew from committee
 
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
deliberations it wasn't a desire to pass
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
the full cost on to employers through
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
the rates so uh the next line three uaal
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
that's the unfunded portion of the of
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
restoring this benefit multiplier
 
00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
um you know uh to to the to the group
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
um that's typically where during the
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislative session most of the analyzes
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
ends how much is the ual piece because
 
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
there is a future normal cost for
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
benefit accruals
 
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and that's what the the next line is
 
00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
employer normal class with ual
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
pre-funded so what that means is if the
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
state were if this bill was to pass and
 
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
the state provided
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
um you know 62.6 million there still
 
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
would be an impact on employer rates but
 
00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 align:start position:0%
it would be significantly lower be about
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
a third of what it was with no
 
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.909 align:start position:0%
a third of what it was with no
pre-funding

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
pre-funding
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
and that um
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
amounts shown right below in actual
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
dollars projected for FY 26.
 
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
um and then finally and this came up at
 
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
the committee's last meeting with the
 
00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
discussion of terminal funding and what
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
that actually means so so terminal
 
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
funding is basically the actuary is
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
projecting all of the past the unfunded
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
costs plus what the future normal costs
 
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
um you know uh calculated back into
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
today's dollars so that's that's the
 
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
largest number there and that's the
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
bottom line and normally if you're
 
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
changing benefits
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
um for any of the groups in the
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
retirement system you it's uh it would
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
be practically impossible to terminal
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
fund because as new hire is entering and
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
accruing these benefits and things like
 
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
that but but since this is essentially a
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
closed group of you know 1800 give or
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
take people you know the actuary was
 
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
able to calculate a terminal funding
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
cost so that bottom line uh terminal
 
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
funding costs no rate impact is the
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
equivalent of saying if
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
there's a consensus to do this and
 
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
there's a consensus for the employers to
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
pay nothing extra you know the state
 
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
would write us a check for that amount
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
and you know we'd all leave and we'd be
 
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
and you know we'd all leave and we'd be
done

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
um so that that's sort of the the
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
shorthand version of that and and the
 
00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:59.089 align:start position:0%
shorthand version of that and and the
same

00:07:59.089 --> 00:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
um pieces apply for 22.59 in terms of
 
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
concept the numbers
 
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
for 22.59 are
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
um less uh partially because the
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
multiplier is is a change in a graduated
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
way so it only reverts to 2.25 for those
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
with less than five years
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
at the time of the change
 
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.189 align:start position:0%
at the time of the change
um

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the difference between
 
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
the two and that that's what the numbers
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
mean I hope I
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
didn't go too fast so please anybody
 
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.610 align:start position:0%
didn't go too fast so please anybody
um

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
roll it back if needed
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.589 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
wow

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
wow
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley uh thank you very much
 
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.829 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley uh thank you very much
so

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:53.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:57.260 align:start position:0%
so this bottom line number on 2259 and
 
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
2258 of 92.6 and 59.1
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is similar to how the benefit was
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
funded in House Bill 1587 terminally
 
00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:13.339 align:start position:0%
funding no great impact is that correct
 
00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459 align:start position:0%
actually 1587 the 43 million last year
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
for that bill approximately 43 million
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
that was just the unfunded piece so
 
00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
there was a slight increase in the
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
normal cost for that one this this one
 
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019 align:start position:0%
is funding at an even higher level okay
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
than that but it's analogous yes okay
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
excellent job Mr Carlin I don't see any
 
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
so given that we have these two
 
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
amendments with their costs
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
which if any do we wish to recommend to
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
A legislature to bring forward this
 
00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:10.509 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
certainly I don't recommend either one
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
of these because of the cost
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to what I had presented
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
before is that if we are trying to
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
retain officers
 
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.949 align:start position:0%
retain officers
um

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339 align:start position:0%
you know at 20 years and at 30 years we
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
can certainly raise the contributions by
 
00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:34.459 align:start position:0%
a quarter of a percent each one of those
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
we've had the figures for that which are
 
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
greatly reduced from this
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
um and augment that with a uh the
 
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
ability for the the unions to negotiate
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
a match for voluntary contributions
 
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
which could be used by them for any
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
purpose they choose they could buy an
 
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
annuity with a cola in it they could you
 
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
know take the lump sum they could
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
whatever you can do with all that money
 
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:09.740 align:start position:0%
and they could do that and
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
certainly a much more fiscally
 
00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:14.350 align:start position:0%
certainly a much more fiscally
responsible

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
solution to this than either of the
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Campo well I would recommend that we
 
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.650 align:start position:0%
Mr Campo well I would recommend that we
um

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
support 2258 because that's exactly what
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do we're trying to
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
retain our most experienced First
 
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.750 align:start position:0%
retain our most experienced First
Responders

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
I think one of the issues that concerns
 
00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339 align:start position:0%
me with 2259 when a lot of these
 
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.019 align:start position:0%
significant changes were made we ended
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
up creating groups within the system so
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
you have people working side by side who
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
have different benefits yet who
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
experience the same risk and harm in
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
their job my concern with 2259 is you'd
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh actually it'd be three
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
because you would because you're
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
eliminated again you're eliminating
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
three groups no you're right the the uh
 
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
because you're the agency or don't
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
change all right so that is so that is a
 
00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
concern that I have well that's fine but
 
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
I think 22.58 Mr Campo has cleanup that
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
we recommend 2258 which is
 
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
does not have that problem
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
are you looking for a second are we
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
under that would be a good idea I would
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
all right so that there's a
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we endorse Amendment
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
22 fight
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
2258 and recommend it to the legislature
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
and so it's open for discussion comments
 
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley uh thank you very much I
 
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.750 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley uh thank you very much I
appreciate

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
um the concern expressed by Senator
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
Susie the
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
um reason that I
 
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:20.660 align:start position:0%
ask for a multiplier that was
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
2.25 and 2.5 was because I thought that
 
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
we could have something that was more
 
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.030 align:start position:0%
we could have something that was more
affordable

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
um I can just
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself and I think
 
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:38.420 align:start position:0%
Senator gray already has echoed that the
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
92.6 million dollars I I just do not
 
00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:42.470 align:start position:0%
92.6 million dollars I I just do not
know

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:44.420 align:start position:0%
how we
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
squeeze that into
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
a budget and an off year
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
um I I just don't know how we do it with
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
some of the requests that are already
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
being made you know sitting on fiscal
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
um I know that we're going to get a big
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
request from
 
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and administrator
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
Broderick or the YDC
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
um that's not all of one's funding but
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
it's certainly something that we have to
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
think about so I
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
cannot support
 
00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:22.389 align:start position:0%
cannot support
um

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
2259 uh 2258 because of the
 
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
huge impact
 
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.069 align:start position:0%
huge impact
um

00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
I do I continue to believe if we're
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
going to do something and you know 2258
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
I think is a better
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
um or 2259 is A Better Way Forward
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
it is more affordable but still it's 60
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
um that is also a huge amount of money
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have to come up with
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
I think there are ways of dealing with
 
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.069 align:start position:0%
I think there are ways of dealing with
it

00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:14:58.079 --> 00:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.350 align:start position:0%
um
potentially

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not ready to recommend it at this
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
point in time I mean I just you know we
 
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
we talked about this before and I think
 
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
I presented these two amendments I we
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
had July revenues that were off by
 
00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:17.339 align:start position:0%
um several million dollars we made up
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
most of that in August so the first two
 
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
months of this fiscal year we are barely
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
at even we're not running the kind of
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
surpluses that would allow us
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh to pay for a 59 or
 
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
a 92 million dollar appropriation I I
 
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.310 align:start position:0%
a 92 million dollar appropriation I I
just

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
don't think we can do it I would hope
 
00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:42.350 align:start position:0%
don't think we can do it I would hope
that

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
um all of us
 
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.410 align:start position:0%
um all of us
would

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
that it's terminally funded
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
with the normalized cost being as Marty
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
talked about reflected in the
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
final numbers on both of the summary
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
sheets so that there's not a property
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
tax impact
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
um I think that would be very
 
00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:08.810 align:start position:0%
um I think that would be very
problematic

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.410 align:start position:0%
problematic
um

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
so I can't support
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
it's a 92 million and I think it's
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
premature until we see September and
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
October revenues to make a
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
recommendation on the 59 and I think
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
that we also have to be willing and
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
maybe some of that is offline
 
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:30.230 align:start position:0%
maybe some of that is offline
discussions

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
um try to figure out how we might be
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
able to pay for that 59 million dollars
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
if we choose to go forward with that
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and um
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
I will say I'm I'm a little anxious
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
about our moving towards the
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
recommendation or taking a vote I didn't
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
think actually that we were in the in
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
the moment of making motions and
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
seconding on on these at this point
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
because I share my colleague's concern
 
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.689 align:start position:0%
because I share my colleague's concern
that

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
we need to have a bill that can be a
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
clean bill that potentially can go
 
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:12.380 align:start position:0%
um to the legislature on the veto day
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll deal with the most immediate
 
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
problem that we face which is doing
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
something about
 
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:20.579 align:start position:0%
about this and um
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
so I I I hear what is being said about
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
since we do have time through the fall
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
to have more Revenue numbers
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we are a commission we're
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to do what we're going to do but
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
legislature there are 424 people waiting
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
for us potentially on January 3rd and
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I think it really is our our duty as
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
a commission to come forward with a plan
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
which is going to have very substantial
 
00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:49.610 align:start position:0%
which is going to have very substantial
support

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
um and bipartisan support so I I don't
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
know if there's a way for us to kind of
 
00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:57.110 align:start position:0%
know if there's a way for us to kind of
pause

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
pause
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
um on on voting today because I don't
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
think I don't think we're quite ready to
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
make a vote uh
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
we could certainly pause or stop
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
anything we're doing
 
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
you know it's within our control
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
by what mechanism Senator were you
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
planning to have a bill for a vote on
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
I think if there is Broad support for
 
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.350 align:start position:0%
I think if there is Broad support for
something

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
that's bipartisan
 
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
that the affected individuals
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
may not be everything they want but it's
 
00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:39.380 align:start position:0%
a reasonable compromise
 
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.029 align:start position:0%
a reasonable compromise
that

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
puts this issue to bed and we're not
 
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
debating it for the next
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
several sessions
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
and if there's that kind of broad
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
support from
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
um you know those of us who have to vote
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
on it those of us who would not us but
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
those who would benefit
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
from it
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
um and you know the support of
 
00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:06.710 align:start position:0%
um and you know the support of
organizations

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
the association of counties the
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
municipal Association School boards
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
Association that you know that it's not
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
going to impact their budgets and and
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers that they represent I I do
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
think that there would be the
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
possibility of being able to move on
 
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
something whether it's on veto day or
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
um very quickly in January with a you
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
know normal procedure bill that went
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
through hearings I I think that's I
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
think that's very possible
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
um but again it I think it's going to
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
take consensus and it's going to take
 
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
a willingness
 
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:47.630 align:start position:0%
a willingness
um

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
you know for people to be willing to
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
compromise and and you know to get that
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
number down
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
to a point that it's affordable as we
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
are you know going into the
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
next budget with you know the likelihood
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
of more expenses for the YDC issue
 
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
um and probably other things too but uh
 
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.310 align:start position:0%
um and probably other things too but uh
I

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
you know I'm an eternal officer you
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
certainly are Senator I'd like to
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
mention that I've noticed at least two
 
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
different bills on the topic and that's
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
only on the first day or so of of House
 
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
Bill submission so I do not believe that
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's any chance that we will
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
have a complete conclusion on all
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
pension issues I hate to disappoint you
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
but we're not that's not going to happen
 
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.650 align:start position:0%
but we're not that's not going to happen
Maybe

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:47.660 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
we'll see all right Mr rill
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
um you know just kind of listen to some
 
00:20:59.690 --> 00:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
of the remarks about uh what we
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
anticipated the cost might be versus
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
what the cost actual actually is
 
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.529 align:start position:0%
what the cost actual actually is
um

00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:08.289 --> 00:21:08.299 align:start position:0%
you know I I
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
forgive me for feeling as though this
 
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:13.580 align:start position:0%
seems like somewhat of a moving Target
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh as far as what is going to be
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
affordable and what is not going to be
 
00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
affordable and what is not going to be
affordable

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:24.380 align:start position:0%
um you know we've talked about uh
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
bills that
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know House Bill 436 was I believe uh
 
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
and Mr Carlin correct me if I'm wrong uh
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the neighborhood of 134
 
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
million to get that fully funded
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
um while I'm surprised by the number uh
 
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:43.700 align:start position:0%
to amendment
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
2258. I do think it's worth talking
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
about where we think that Benchmark is
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
where we think that goal is
 
00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
um for what is Affordable and what is
 
00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:55.669 align:start position:0%
um for what is Affordable and what is
not

00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to focus on what
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
brought us here in the first place and
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
that's that we have uh Public Safety
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
officers in every discipline are leaving
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
the job and what struck me uh is a bit
 
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
of a shock when we started this
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
discussion uh a few weeks back
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
we were talking about uh a finite number
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
of individuals and that number
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
happened to be incorrect because we had
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
a significant number of individuals who
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
have left the job since uh House Bill
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
4436 was unsuccessful and that trend has
 
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
been a trend that has been going on for
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
quite some time and what I'm worried
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
about here is that we're going to
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
continue to kick this can down the road
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
to a point that this number of of Public
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
Safety officers affected by uh
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
you know this bill or this group that
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
we're talking about specifically
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
um I'd hate to see that number dwindle
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
to a place where it then becomes
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
affordable because then we're dealing
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
with another problem and that's the lack
 
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
of firefighters police officers and
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
Correctional Personnel I think we really
 
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
need to take a good look at this
 
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.210 align:start position:0%
need to take a good look at this
amendment

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley I appreciate you
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
bringing it Forward
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
um to get the numbers on this I think if
 
00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:16.250 align:start position:0%
um to get the numbers on this I think if
we

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
could potentially talk about the
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fund it the same way that
 
00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
we did House Bill 1587 last year I think
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
that there's some value to that and I
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
and I recognize
 
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
um wanting to have the luxury of
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
terminally funding
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
um but I I know that the costs uh the
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
downshift if if any was minimal on 1587
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
to the point that none of us uh actually
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
thought there was any
 
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
today when we when we talked to Mr
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
Carlin so I think it would be worth
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
um potentially funding the unfunded
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
piece uh to this this amendment and
 
00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
continuing to move it forward to get it
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
done on veto day
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
anyone else have something to say Dad
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
Senator gray
 
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.450 align:start position:0%
Senator gray
um

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that I find very
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
interesting is you know we're trying to
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
set this thing up so that we save our
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
most experienced officers
 
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.409 align:start position:0%
most experienced officers
fine

00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:24.419 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:25.390 align:start position:0%
fine
okay

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
proposal that I put in to raise the
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
multiplier at year 20 and year 30.
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
would affect all of the people in group
 
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.010 align:start position:0%
would affect all of the people in group
two

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
not the ones that are in this bracket
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
but all of the people who are in group
 
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.370 align:start position:0%
but all of the people who are in group
two

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
if we talk only about those people in
 
00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:48.059 align:start position:0%
that bracket
 
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
and we're having this massive
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
retirement because of the retirement
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
system not being and I don't believe
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
that that's the real cause
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
then we're just pushing the can down the
 
00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:03.110 align:start position:0%
then we're just pushing the can down the
road

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
and the money that we're talking about
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
because the difference between
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
a thousand eight hundred just to make a
 
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
median number
 
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
and the three or four thousand people
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
that are going either in that group that
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
aren't part of that
 
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
then what we're saying is they're going
 
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
to leave they're going to be gone
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
they're going to not be around
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
so if you if you fix for one group
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
and think that's going to solve this
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
thing forever
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
I think you should wake up I think you
 
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
should start drinking some coffee
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay because
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know negotiating wages
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
if I go back to on you know imagine a
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
lot of you have had Maslow's theories
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
okay is that I in Rochester what did I
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
do when I had a problem you know as a
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
member of the city council I raised the
 
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
wages I got more people to apply because
 
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
I raised wages I stopped the people from
 
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
going from Rochester down to Portsmouth
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
down to the state police down to other
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
things because I raised the wages okay
 
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's what I did
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
I didn't mess with the retirement system
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
because that wasn't what they were
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
asking for and which would be borne out
 
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
by Maslow's series I got to take care of
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
the wages first because I don't worry
 
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
about retirement until I get there
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
so saying well you know the problem's
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to go away no the problem isn't
 
00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
going to go away and the funding is
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
going to increase and not decrease
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be those people
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
that are at the 10 11 12 year mark right
 
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.450 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
to cover the people you know that are in
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
that bracket
 
00:27:00.779 --> 00:27:02.149 align:start position:0%
that bracket
hey

00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
divide the number that you're coming up
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
with by that total body count see what
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
the number is
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
and the constituents that come to me are
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
disturbed by that number
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh representative O'Brien
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Madam chair good to see
 
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
you again you know
 
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm representative Mike O'Brien uh
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
from Nashville I sit on Edna and I'm
 
00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:36.260 align:start position:0%
pinch hitting today for uh
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
representative Leachman
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
uh I spent majority of my career within
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
the fire service and I am currently
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
retired but I also wear another hat
 
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
and that hat is a vice president of NASA
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
was born of alderman
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
I see all too much
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
the problems of people that are leaving
 
00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:01.220 align:start position:0%
the job
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
because I mean another problem that's
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
out there it's not part of the pension
 
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
system but the drug problem other
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
different things that are occurring out
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
there in the city of Nashua I'm sure
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
Manchester is having the same thing it's
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
taking a toll
 
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
the firefighters and police officers of
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
our communities are getting burnt out
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
and they need to have something maybe
 
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
something from the state that says yes
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
we respect of what you do and we're
 
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
going to try to make uh you know
 
00:28:39.769 --> 00:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
retirement a little bit better it's more
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
than an enticement
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
you know it's something that they
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
deserve they're giving an awful lot of
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
their time and I respect that
 
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
representative gray thank you for uh
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
mentioning Maslow I haven't heard that
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
name in a long time but part of the goal
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the retirement is to get to the
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
self-realization that is the end of the
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
goal in my maslode
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
I have reached that in my retirement
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
and so coming up with a vehicle to
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
really get us here and that's why if
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
this went to a vote today I'm going to
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
support uh 2258.
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
but the main reason I have worked within
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
the culture where you had to Workforce
 
00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:27.649 align:start position:0%
the culture where you had to Workforce
divided

00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
divided
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the situation in Nashua it was with
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
sick time other different things the
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
infighting it wrecks the spirit Decor of
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
every organization
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
when at this particular juncture that
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
would you know some of the police
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
officers and firefighters are dealing
 
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
with on a daily basis they need to be
 
00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:51.419 align:start position:0%
United to do their job
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
so in two uh 2258 there seems to
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate that particular problem so I
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
would support it
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
um and I'll leave that Madam chair at
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
that for now unless additional but I do
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
agree with uh brother real for those
 
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
things that he has said very accurate
 
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
and very true so I'll leave it at that
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
Mr real thank you madam chair
 
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.669 align:start position:0%
Mr real thank you madam chair
um

00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
you know I I appreciate that we've all
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
come together here to try and get
 
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
something done I I don't want this to
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
turn into a
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
um a commission where we don't make
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
progress here and I'm I'm concerned that
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
that might be the direction uh we're
 
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.810 align:start position:0%
that might be the direction uh we're
headed

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
headed
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
um the one thing I'd like to say about
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Gray's thoughts on uh
 
00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:48.620 align:start position:0%
increasing a
 
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
multiplier at years 25 and 30. we heard
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
from Mr Carlin a couple of weeks ago
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
stating that 25 and 30-year careers in
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
the police service and the fire service
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
and Corrections are not the norm and
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
that group one and group two
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
classifications were built off the fact
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
that group two uh tends to have
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
extremely hazardous occupations which
 
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
makes it even more difficult to reach
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
those 25 and 30-year benchmarks the
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
other piece to this
 
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
if we want to talk about impacting
 
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
everyone uh in the group 2 system which
 
00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not arguing against I think
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
that that is where we need to end up
 
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.510 align:start position:0%
that that is where we need to end up
eventually

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.110 align:start position:0%
eventually
um

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
new members coming on the job now uh are
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
required to put in 25 years of service
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
if they get a uh they go from a 2.25
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
multiplier at year 25. to a year 30 to
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
get their two and a half percent
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
multiplier their pension is going to
 
00:31:59.690 --> 00:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
increase by one and a quarter percent
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
no one is going to do that that's not
 
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
going to be a retention tool
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
and secondly to that uh Senator gray I
 
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
would like to agree with you on your
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
thoughts for a uh matching supplemental
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
retirement plan I think that that's an
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
excellent idea
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
um but that
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
we are eligible to do now
 
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
in contract negotiations that's
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
something that exists now in fact
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
um we run our own supplemental
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
retirement program and we encourage our
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
members to be involved in it so if a
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
local union wants to go to their
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
employer and negotiate the terms of a
 
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
matching contribution that can happen
 
00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.250 align:start position:0%
matching contribution that can happen
now

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
Mr Karen thank you madam chair just to
 
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.210 align:start position:0%
Mr Karen thank you madam chair just to
uh

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
two points of thought I can't find
 
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.210 align:start position:0%
two points of thought I can't find
myself

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
supporting any proposal unless we know
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
how it's funded most of you have more
 
00:33:03.409 --> 00:33:03.419 align:start position:0%
experience their retirement system than
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
I do but my understanding is there's
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
three basic pockets of money to fund the
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
retirement system one is the employee
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
rates which are set in statute
 
00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
the second are investment returns they
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
are what they are and the default of the
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
Delta are the employer rates so if we
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
set about to recommend any kind of
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that has a cost impact and
 
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059 align:start position:0%
don't identify the source it's going to
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
default to the employer rates and that's
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
a significant issue the other issue I
 
00:33:36.649 --> 00:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
like to raise is you know we all we all
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
live and work our own vacuums and dairy
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
may be different I'm not sure but when I
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
get on this committee I asked my HR
 
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
Director about our retention for our
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
group two people and if you can she
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
conducts exit interviews in the last two
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
years we've got about 130 folks in group
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
two with us at the town
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
we've had 27 people leave in the last
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
two years that's about 10 percent a year
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
of those 27 folks 12
 
00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
had service retirements the eight they
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
attained the age of 45 or 20 years I
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
guess it's the category a folks we
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately have four disability
 
00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.409 align:start position:0%
unfortunately have four disability
retirements

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
retirements
 
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
we had six other folks who stayed in the
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
system but went to outside agencies
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
which is my signif other New Hampshire
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
agencies which is which is my challenge
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
of finding money to make our wages more
 
00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:28.849 align:start position:0%
of finding money to make our wages more
attractive

00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
attractive
 
00:34:31.609 --> 00:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
we had a medic who resigned to pursue a
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
nursing career
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
we had a patrolman who called the chief
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
of police on the night before the
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
academy and said this isn't for me
 
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.310 align:start position:0%
academy and said this isn't for me
uh

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
we had one person go to Massachusetts or
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
one person to go to the government and
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
the last person was separated by
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our Direction and not
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
theirs so and of the 27 folks who had
 
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:55.379 align:start position:0%
left us two actually cited the pension
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
as a reason for doing something
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
different so Dairy could be different
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
but that's my sphere of information I
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
have currently thank you
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the information
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
I know in my town when somebody leaves
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's because there's no opportunities
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
for for promotion in such a tiny
 
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.730 align:start position:0%
for for promotion in such a tiny
Department

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
there we go yeah they will go to Dairy
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
yes that's a better better opportunity
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have something that
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you madam
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
chair I would just like to and uh
 
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
appreciate the numbers sir that you you
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
came up with uh and I wonder what's a
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
plethora of reasons why particular
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
people you know retire on any job they
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
can come up with any particular reason
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
why they break employment myself
 
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
personally I had a bunch of Young Bucks
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
I couldn't keep up with anymore
 
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
I thought I could
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
but I couldn't you know and it was time
 
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
for me to move on to Green the pastures
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
and I have
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
but uh you know
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
when you look at it I don't know if they
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
would really put that in complete
 
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
analysis but I would like to say when we
 
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
look at the firefighters in particular
 
00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:11.339 align:start position:0%
they don't get out at 25 years
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
I didn't I stayed 35 and I found within
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
my group that a lot of firefighters
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
actually do stay longer than the 25
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
years so they should be granted some
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
form of uh entitlement for staying
 
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
within that longevity and making that
 
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
particular commitment I think I did ask
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
Mr Collins at one time in conversation
 
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
and he may have a number off the top of
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
his head but I'm not going to hold him
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
to it but the firefighters have been
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
as far as the longevity of the nhrs have
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
been a long-term contributor to the
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
program and somewhat deserving of any
 
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
yeah just a couple of things first of
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
all I think Senator Gray's proposal
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
starts at 20 years not 25
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
um so just correcting that
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the discussion about
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
different tiers and things like that the
 
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
retirement system has always had a
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
10-year vesting and
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
anybody you know for throughout the
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
history of the retirement system that
 
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
had less than 10 years has not been
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
vested so we've always had differing
 
00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:38.099 align:start position:0%
tiers and and lastly I would say that um
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
as somebody who supported House Bill
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
1587 and the 42.9 million dollars
 
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.010 align:start position:0%
1587 and the 42.9 million dollars
um

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:48.380 align:start position:0%
that we voted for I believe it was in
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
2022 that was terminally funded and
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
um no impact on property taxpayers to
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
get back to your point Dave I think
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
that's the only way
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
um that we should consider doing it I
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
had thought that
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
um you know when we passed 1587 that
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
some of these issues have been resolved
 
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
well clearly they haven't been
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
um but I think it needs to be said that
 
00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:23.579 align:start position:0%
when we voted to appropriate 42.9
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars for
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
roughly 1800 people in a enhanced
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit
 
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
that was a pretty significant show of
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
good faith on the legislature's part on
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan basis so
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
surreal then representative O'Brien
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to uh clarify
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
something that and maybe this is just
 
00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:56.579 align:start position:0%
the difference of perspective but
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
um I don't think anyone uh that was
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
impacted by House Bill 1587 last year
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
interpreted that as an enhancement of
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
benefits that was a reinstatement of one
 
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh just something
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
for additional information for us to
 
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
chew on
 
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.650 align:start position:0%
chew on
um

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
like you say Recruitment and Retention
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
are big issues but with people leaving
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
and it is acute with people uh leaving
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
that means you have positions such as
 
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:37.940 align:start position:0%
firefighters or police officers
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers that need to be
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
filled how do you fill that you end up
 
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
filling it in with overtime
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
that means yes maybe it might save on
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
some of the medical benefit but that
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
means when you come up and I can say
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
this from Nashua when we work out an
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
annual budget you try to keep it a
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
proper amount what you anticipate in an
 
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
overtime account but with people
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
disappearing on you
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
now that inflates that particular number
 
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
so you say where is the cost in spot of
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
the cost is being relayed in this
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
Delayed Action coming back to the
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities because they have to make
 
00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
up the difference now in Nashua we have
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
how many firefighters we really want on
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
duty you know is it enough
 
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
maybe some may think so I've always
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
lived under the thing there may be too
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
many firemen right now in the city in
 
00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
Nashua five minutes from now there may
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
not be enough
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
but the thing is we come try to come up
 
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
with a workable number but there is a
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
hidden cost that I want us to
 
00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:47.579 align:start position:0%
contemplate as we sit here uh
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
backfilling these positions with people
 
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
that are vacating and that's by overtime
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
which is inflating Municipal budgets
 
00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
anyone else have something to add or
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
just want to go back to something that
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
my colleague Senator Waters said and
 
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
that is that I think everyone came to
 
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
the table wanting to do something and I
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
think Senator Bradley got that process
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
started now we have more information
 
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
but I do think we might need just a
 
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
little more and I would hate to see us
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
in a situation today where without that
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
missing piece of information about
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
additional funding or what the next two
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
months of Revenue looks like I'd hate to
 
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
see us divided in some way when I do
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
think we can hopefully all maybe not all
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
but pretty close get to yes so
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
I think it might make sense to wait
 
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
until a later date to make a final
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
um my my two cents all right thank you I
 
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
appreciate that anyone else
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
I I think I uh definitely agree with uh
 
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie uh I'd hate to jump into
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
this thing and be divided
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
if we're going to pass this and we're
 
00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
going to get something done and continue
 
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
to do things I think we all need to be
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
on the same page and if it takes another
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
couple three weeks to do that I think it
 
00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
would be prudent for us to do that and
 
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
not jump ahead right now and pass
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
something that wow we're not going to
 
00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
almost get unanimous consent on
 
00:42:32.579 --> 00:42:34.430 align:start position:0%
almost get unanimous consent on
right

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.290 align:start position:0%
right
Mr

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
be with the center and the uh speaker
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to withdraw my
 
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
motion to pass 2258
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr real dude okay
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
all right so we if we need more
 
00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
information I know the Senators want
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
information on
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue when do you think you will
 
00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
have at least the next month's Revenue
 
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
so that you'll have a better feeling so
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue generally will know September
 
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh by October 3rd or 4th
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
um we'll know October revenues same time
 
00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:20.579 align:start position:0%
in November
 
00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:21.710 align:start position:0%
in November
um

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
September is a very big Revenue month
 
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.130 align:start position:0%
September is a very big Revenue month
um

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
that might give us enough information
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
but I mean the kind of numbers that
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
I I just speaking for myself I'm going
 
00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
to feel a lot more comfortable
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
um having more information not less
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
um especially
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
because I keep stressing
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
I can't support anything that's not
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
terminally funded
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
um and I think that that's probably the
 
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
consensus on a bipartisan basis of
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
senators because the way that all of
 
00:44:03.839 --> 00:44:05.030 align:start position:0%
senators because the way that all of
these

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:05.650 align:start position:0%
these
um

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:05.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
some form or another of terminally
 
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
funding I I think that
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
in that case why don't we plan not to to
 
00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:23.060 align:start position:0%
discuss these particular amendments
 
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
I would think that we'll have
 
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
September Revenue by October 5th okay
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
um October closes on a Sunday
 
00:44:49.859 --> 00:44:51.589 align:start position:0%
um October closes on a Sunday
um

00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
so generally speaking it takes a couple
 
00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:57.260 align:start position:0%
of days for Dra to put it together with
 
00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
administrative services but Grant do you
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.790 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.190 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
all right so that would
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
plan to meet on October 5th to discuss
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
this in light of September revenues
 
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.890 align:start position:0%
this in light of September revenues
hopefully

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I would very
 
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
much appreciate is if someone has a
 
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.710 align:start position:0%
much appreciate is if someone has a
specific

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion either for
 
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
this issue or any of the other issues we
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
were brainstorming about I would very
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
much like to have them in writing so
 
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
that we can look at them and know what
 
00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:48.500 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
I have one that I'm going to be
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
mandatory overtime as defined by the
 
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
employer counts as base pay because that
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
brings up an issue that a lot of people
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
have commented to me about that there
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
are they're forced to work overtime
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
and they don't get credit for it so I
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
would like to put that in it's this very
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
simple Bill I'm not sure I'm a hundred
 
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
percent in favor of it but I think it's
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
simple enough to put in as a bill and
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
important enough to debate so I'll I'll
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
be putting that in this week
 
00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:35.339 align:start position:0%
the commission can take a vote on to
 
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
endorse it or not but
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'll do it by myself so it's something
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
that I think we ought to do
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
Madam chair if you need a close sponsor
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
I believe that it will negate all of the
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
calculations that have been done uh up
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
to this point because it changes the
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
base of the salaries only going forward
 
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.410 align:start position:0%
base of the salaries only going forward
um

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
again it's still when we talk terminally
 
00:47:12.119 --> 00:47:13.970 align:start position:0%
again it's still when we talk terminally
funding

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
um well
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
sure that will come up and on other
 
00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:25.819 align:start position:0%
topics when I was talking to people
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
about a voluntary contribution where the
 
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
the state or the local government could
 
00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339 align:start position:0%
match I was told that there wasn't
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation enough and that it
 
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
would require legislative action to be
 
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
able to do that so that their parameters
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
would be there that would require that
 
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
may or may not be the truth but that's
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
what I was told at the time and I bring
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
that up because we haven't talked about
 
00:47:56.339 --> 00:47:57.950 align:start position:0%
that up because we haven't talked about
Cola

00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
Cola
 
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
we talked a great deal about colas well
 
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
without without coming to any real
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
conclusions except that they're nice to
 
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
get and and I thank you madam chairman
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
for your comment but you know I would
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
like to be able to to finish my thought
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
before before you do comment uh
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
that you know the two proposals that we
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
have here in front of us don't address
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
anything to do with code
 
00:48:26.569 --> 00:48:26.579 align:start position:0%
and that is why I did come up with that
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh plan where if we had a match and
 
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
people put money in uh certainly when
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government changed from the
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
first from the Civil Service retirement
 
00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859 align:start position:0%
system to Furs I did put in money into
 
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
that system uh where there was no match
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
for civil service but I was able to use
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
that money you know later on to do other
 
00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:54.980 align:start position:0%
things with and so I think that you know
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
we need to look at this as a whole which
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
is the way the legislation in House Bill
 
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
2 was written it wasn't written for any
 
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
particular house bill it was written for
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
us to have a free hand so
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh though both of those need to be come
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
into play when any of the solutions we
 
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator I would like to to
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate my request that if you have a
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
suggestion that you put it down
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
with numbers so that we can agree on
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
could you bring that to the next meeting
 
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
um I've already supplied it to Marty
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
last uh spring I believe it was and we
 
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
can resurrect those emails and in
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
Fordham on to you with the numbers that
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
he calculated at the time for but it
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
does not include anything to do with the
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
match because the match would be
 
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
separate from the retirement system
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
completely okay and uh the only number
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
that I was given on that because it
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be a negotiated uh agreement
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know is that for the state portion
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
of it it would be uh in the 15 million
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
dollars but again that would be
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:24.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
sir

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
my apologies first for being a tardier I
 
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
got behind a tractor on the way here
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
from Keene to Concord and when you get
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
behind a literally a tractor just takes
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
um my name is Chris Coates I'm the
 
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
County Administrator here in uh in
 
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county and
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
I've been listening to the conversation
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
I just wanted uh some clarity because I
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
I do feel that there are some some real
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
issues that we're facing in in Cheshire
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
county a rural rural area especially
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh police and fire and
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
law enforcement across the board we're
 
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more that we're picking
 
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
up more and more towns and over having
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
oversight over towns because they can't
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
find people to go in and man those
 
00:51:02.579 --> 00:51:04.430 align:start position:0%
find people to go in and man those
positions

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's just putting more pressure
 
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
on our Sheriff's Department to do so and
 
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
on the fire side you know we're we're a
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
little bit different in Cheshire county
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
as we have more group one than we have
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
group two so uh Senator gray when you
 
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
said group one
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
um it was a little magic to my ears
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
um but but I also wanted to know from
 
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley when you say terminal
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
just from my my knowledge that means a
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
one time and then it would be that we
 
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
would then have it passed down to us to
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
carry it's a balancing act I understand
 
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make I just wanted a
 
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.290 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make I just wanted a
clarity

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
so terminally funding would mean that we
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
authorized an appropriation
 
00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
of whether it's in the amendment let's
 
00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
just say
 
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2258 which is a straight 2.5
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
percent of 92.6 million dollars so we
 
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
appropriate that money it goes to the
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
retirement system and that is the
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
expectation that there will be no impact
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
on property taxpayers for the duration
 
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.390 align:start position:0%
on property taxpayers for the duration
of

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
the benefits being paid out to those
 
00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:17.099 align:start position:0%
members and that's what's meant by
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
terminally funding
 
00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
I appreciate I appreciate the uh the
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Martinez
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
Madam chair asked and be recognized
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
00:52:31.319 --> 00:52:32.930 align:start position:0%
please thank you
um

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
I would like
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
to ask this question
 
00:52:39.849 --> 00:52:39.859 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're here because we recognize that
 
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
some changes were made
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
in a number of group two
 
00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:52.940 align:start position:0%
workers were disproportionately affected
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
when we changed the deal on them
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
and we said we're going to calculate
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
your benefits differently for everybody
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
hired between 2002 and 2011. so we're
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
here to fix that problem
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
and I can't put a life of me
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
uh balance why we would need new money
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
just think if I go to a bank and I put a
 
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in that account and
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
then they tell me that everybody that
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
open account between 2000 and June 2011
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
will pay fees that nobody else will just
 
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.030 align:start position:0%
will pay fees that nobody else will just
them

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
and I say that is wrong and then they'll
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
say okay that is right it is wrong and I
 
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
said okay well then give my money back
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
no we're gonna have to raise new Revenue
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
to make that fix
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
absolutely not
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
we need to follow the money and see what
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
the money went
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
employers pay their part citizen Town
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
pay their taxes investment returns came
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
in and workers paid their fair share of
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
what they were supposed to pay
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
so where is the money then
 
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:08.339 align:start position:0%
well it's at nhrs that's exactly what
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
the money is and that's what the fix
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
needs to happen
 
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.690 align:start position:0%
needs to happen
there

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of fixing what we
 
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
want to fix we shouldn't have to go out
 
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
and say well taxpayer because if we use
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
the same terms
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
when we did this what we did
 
00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:30.020 align:start position:0%
is we spiked
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
the pay down of the unfunded accrue
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
Library we did that and we say oh we
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
should have done that
 
00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:42.260 align:start position:0%
but we can't go and double dip and ask
 
00:54:44.569 --> 00:54:44.579 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to pay again because we want
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
to raise new Revenue
 
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
to cover a mistake that we've already
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
done and we know where the money is it's
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
just a matter of all the money
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
correct the thing and move on
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know yield thank you
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
I I think we should consider that
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
okay well that's
 
00:55:05.099 --> 00:55:07.309 align:start position:0%
okay well that's
I

00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
I think that what all the money that has
 
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
been paid in has been accounted for and
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
the trouble is that there's
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
we the legislature have been fiddling
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
with the retirement system so much
 
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
going from a
 
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.069 align:start position:0%
going from a
irrational

00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.079 --> 00:55:33.109 align:start position:0%
 
plan

00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
in the 90s and early 2000s who were a
 
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
sensible one means that there was a lot
 
00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
that is not as you say sitting there
 
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
with the retirement the
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
retirement system calculates every two
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
years how much
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
needs to go in for the coming year and
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
all of the contributions that are there
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
and what they've got on hand it's not
 
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
like it's they're ignoring a few million
 
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
dollars sitting somewhere
 
00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
may I follow up please
 
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
when we do such calculations and we say
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
that we're going to need six when we
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
calculate that we're going to have 6.75
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
percent Investments
 
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
and in 2022 we didn't get that right we
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
got minus six and a half
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
minus six and a half
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't go back and you say oh you
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
know this happened so we need to raise
 
00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:41.099 align:start position:0%
new Revenue to cover up for the fact
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
that not only we didn't meet the 6.75
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
but we also were under six and a half so
 
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would have to pay that to make
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't do that but we do that
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
when we say we made
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps we went too far making this
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
calculation on folks that were in the
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
pipeline performing in the job expecting
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
the benefits to be calculated a certain
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
way and we change that on them and we go
 
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
back we say maybe we shouldn't have done
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
that how are we going to fix it well
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to raise new Revenue
 
00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339 align:start position:0%
we're not maybe we don't have the money
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
to find that in other words it's a
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
Fool's errant
 
00:57:20.569 --> 00:57:20.579 align:start position:0%
I think simply we need to fix the
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
problem where the mistake was made
 
00:57:26.089 --> 00:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
and if we realize and we accept that
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have done the fastest
 
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
thing to do is to fix where it is
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we need to raise new
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
revenue for that it is a correction it's
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
Bradley I think it's important to
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
remember where we were in the 2010-11
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
um our unfunded liability was among the
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
worst in the country were under 60
 
00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
percent funded as I recall we've
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
improved that dramatically rates for
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
employers were going through the roof at
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
that point in time to the point that
 
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:07.970 align:start position:0%
that point in time to the point that
um

00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
cities and towns were looking at not
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
being able to hire as many group two
 
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
people at that point in time and it it
 
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
took a long time to get there there's no
 
00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
question about that it was sort of a
 
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
this deal that was made between
 
00:58:25.609 --> 00:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
employers and employees employers were
 
00:58:28.849 --> 00:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
underfunding the system employees
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
um were getting benefits that uh were
 
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
over and above what was mandated through
 
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
the special account
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
investment returns for that period of
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
time were also you know the expectation
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
because I sat on the board at the
 
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
Retirement Board I think in 2011
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
as I recall the investment return was
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be eight and a half
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
percent and it had been lowered from
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
nine percent to eight and a half and we
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
when I was on the board lowered it
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was to seven and three
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
quarters percent and it's been lowered
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
again that had to happen because that
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
was what was happening in real life so
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
you had those three factors of for years
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
employers not paying enough
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
I think it was 900 million dollars of
 
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
excess benefits that were taken out of
 
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
the Corpus to pay for
 
00:59:27.289 --> 00:59:27.299 align:start position:0%
um you know things like the medical
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
subsidy and colos and
 
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.870 align:start position:0%
subsidy and colos and
woeful

00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
woeful
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
um investment returns
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
the only moving piece at that point in
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
time that
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
um where the impact was was on employer
 
00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
rates and Dave I think you remember
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
exactly what that was like you were a
 
00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
town manager then at the time and rates
 
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
were going through the roof
 
00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
here we are 12 years later and I think
 
00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:59.569 align:start position:0%
here we are 12 years later and I think
that

00:59:59.569 --> 00:59:59.579 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:59.579 --> 01:00:00.170 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
you know the folks at this table and
 
01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
others who represent property taxpayers
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's County school or municipal
 
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
or even you know state taxpayers
 
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
the retirement system is in much better
 
01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:21.260 align:start position:0%
shape than it was in 2011.
 
01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:24.299 align:start position:0%
understanding we are trying
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
hopefully to rectify
 
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.510 align:start position:0%
hopefully to rectify
um

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
some of the changes that were made but
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
it has to be affordable but there's no
 
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
money out there that is in the system
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
that could be used for this if we're
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
going to do this there's only a couple
 
01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:44.339 align:start position:0%
of ways of doing it we could pass it on
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
to property taxpayers I've said that's
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
unacceptable it is unacceptable in my
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
view and I think most people in the
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
Senate would agree with that I'm not so
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
sure about the house but I would expect
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
that's the same or
 
01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
we can terminally fund it and and that
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
takes consensus and compromise and
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
understanding what our budget picture is
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
um that's why you know I think it is
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
important that
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
we come back and have September revenues
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
that'll give us a snapshot we may feel
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
like we're in the same position
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know on October 5th that we are
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
today on September 14th but at least
 
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
we'll have you know September revenues
 
01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
but to me that's
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
if we're going to you know go forward
 
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
with one of these amendments and change
 
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
the multiplier we've just got to know
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
where we're going because it is going to
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
take real dollars appropriated by the
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
state so that there's not an impact on
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers I I just
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
keep coming back to that I don't
 
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
those are the bad old days when
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
um when there were problems in the
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
retirement system the rates went through
 
01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:00.500 align:start position:0%
the roof
 
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
and I distinctly remember what was
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
happening at that point in time rates
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
were going through the roof at cities
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
and towns schools Etc and citizen towns
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
were laying people off and we don't want
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
to see that happen again either so
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's why terminally funding is so
 
01:02:18.119 --> 01:02:20.930 align:start position:0%
that's why terminally funding is so
important

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Martinez thank you madam chair
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate the uh the comments and I do
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
remember in 2007 I was at the retirement
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
system as well but you don't have to be
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
there you know that we had a real
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
problem with Investments everybody knows
 
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
that S P 500 was valued lost 50 percent
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
of its value on a bear Market we thought
 
01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
the world was ending and the sky was
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
falling and we did made some changes in
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
2011 finally by the time we got to the
 
01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
legislation I'll say that some changes
 
01:02:55.089 --> 01:02:55.099 align:start position:0%
were okay and some changes were good
 
01:02:59.030 --> 01:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
but nothing said is changed the fact or
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
even tried the fact that a small number
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
of workers were disproportionately
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
affected by these changes and that's why
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
we're here today to correct that it is a
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
correction as we did the example of the
 
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
bank they short my account and I said
 
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
okay then can I have my money no we're
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to raise new revenues
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
maybe as taxpayers absolutely not nobody
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
here is saying that we should raise the
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
tax and there's no need for that the
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
economy did a lot better than that it
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
bounced back it's doing well the
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
retirement system is 62.5 funded our
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
fund is what 11 plus billion dollars at
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
that time was six billion that was
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
almost a double so it is no reason why
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna leave that 1867 workers
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
waiting there until we win the Mega Box
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
or or raise new Revenue knew all this
 
01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
stuff it is
 
01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
what it is it is a correction we know
 
01:04:03.049 --> 01:04:03.059 align:start position:0%
where the money is we follow the money
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
and it's just a thing that it needs to
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
be done this is really if this thing
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
went to a tax I'll be the first one to
 
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
say there's no reason to raise a
 
01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:15.059 align:start position:0%
property tax on that all we need to do
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
is do our job and make the correction
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
where the error was made and I would say
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
it wasn't narrow to do that because they
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
are disproportionately affected
 
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
by that it is bad enough that we raised
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
two percent of of the uh the
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
contribution with no actual benefit but
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
in addition we changed the way you do
 
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
the calculation they they were in the
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
pipeline performing on the job expecting
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
that I understand the concept of vesting
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
all it means that investing you are
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
vested but the terms of the deal is the
 
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
same thing that the courts set for the
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
judges they tried to change the patient
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
for judges and what did the court said
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
in the decision of Claudia versus the
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire 2012 says no you
 
01:04:59.089 --> 01:04:59.099 align:start position:0%
cannot change because judges expected
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
these benefits will stay what they are
 
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
when they are performing the job they
 
01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
did that correctly but somehow
 
01:05:09.049 --> 01:05:09.059 align:start position:0%
we are where we are we can we can change
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
that we think that it is not very funny
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
for a worker that can pay their bills or
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
retire with less benefits than they were
 
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.309 align:start position:0%
retire with less benefits than they were
promised

01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
promised
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:24.109 align:start position:0%
thank you
before

01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to build on those
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
comments and make a particular
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
suggestion and ask so what we do with
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
the information will be a conversation
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
for another day but I feel it's
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
important that we actually get a number
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
for that and to actually find out how
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
much was paid into it because I know I
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that so I'd be
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
curious how much how much money was so
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
for those 10 years for instance with the
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
extra two percent that both groups paid
 
01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
in I'd be curious to know what that
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
number was because I agree with Senator
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
Bradley that the retirement system is in
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
a much better shape today and the more
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
information we have of that condition I
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
think that would be helpful for our
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
discussion number one and number two I'm
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
just building on what you asked for
 
01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.650 align:start position:0%
just building on what you asked for
before

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
um several of us made some suggestions
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
at the last meeting so it would be nice
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to get some Actuarial numbers
 
01:06:11.569 --> 01:06:11.579 align:start position:0%
for those proposals so that we would
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
have more information because I also
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
would like to agree with Senator gray in
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
that I think coming out of here it's for
 
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:20.579 align:start position:0%
this to really work
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
we need to really deal with the whole
 
01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.650 align:start position:0%
we need to really deal with the whole
problem

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
and I happen to think that if we do that
 
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
and we might not be able to do
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
everything like right now but if we have
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
some more information for maybe
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
short-term and long-term plan I think
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful for us okay I
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
who don't have a set of a plan with a
 
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
set of numbers that we could give to the
 
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
actuaries we talked about a lot but
 
01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a specific let's try this
 
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
that we would that we could send to the
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
actuaries if you could try and generate
 
01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:00.299 align:start position:0%
that or get with some other people
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
whatever because you need to have a
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
specific plan before you can Bob
 
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
the actuaries have no imagination and
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
they can't fill in the blanks
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you could come up with
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
something I would it would be very
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
helpful for us to be able to take a look
 
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.089 --> 01:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
I don't care
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
excuse me Senator gray and then Mr Earl
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
along those lines about getting the
 
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
numbers we were handed the chart that
 
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
was made by the retirement system and
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
handed it to us on 824 I would like as
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
these proposals go on to add those to
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
the charts so that we have the
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
information in a very handy and I will
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
note that on the top of page two of that
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
is the proposal that I talked about and
 
01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
the cost information for that on that
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
chart absolutely I will look at that
 
01:07:59.930 --> 01:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
Mr rail
 
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just like to ask
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
a question because procedurally I'm not
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
sure how this works not being a
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
legislator myself
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
um understanding that we're going to
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
wait to see what revenues do I'm fully
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
fully on board with that
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
um but seeing as how this was a uh this
 
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
commission was built from an amendment
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
off of last year's budget is there any
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use any uh funding from
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
last year or surplus funds to fund
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
some or all of any of these amendments
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
certainly if there is any
 
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
the last I I heard the Surplus was
 
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
almost entirely in the education trust
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
fund which would
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
not be able to be used that way
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
but I could be wrong Senator uh
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
um what didn't go into the education
 
01:08:58.970 --> 01:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
trust fund went into the rainy day fund
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
at the close fiscal year uh but those
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
numbers won't be uh actually calculated
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
until we do the audit so uh right now uh
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
as of the end of June
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
um what money was there went into a
 
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:18.299 align:start position:0%
particular spot and if it was left over
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
it went into the rainy day fund and it
 
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
would take legislation I believe to take
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
it out of there that's why we're talking
 
01:09:29.809 --> 01:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
about what the current revenues are uh
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
from July August and then we'll look at
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
September Etc because that would be more
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
likely the funding source that you would
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
use to try and fund anything you try to
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
do here
 
01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
Senator gray uh would that be if you
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
know would that be something that would
 
01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:54.299 align:start position:0%
be accessible uh legislatively through
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
this if it was added to this amendment
 
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
to get access to the that that funding
 
01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.390 align:start position:0%
to get access to the that that funding
again

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
you know things are possible you know uh
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know the harder the more stuff you
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
put in there the harder it is I'm going
 
01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:18.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else have something
 
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
but representative thanks Madam chair I
 
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
think we've been talking a lot about the
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
cost of action and I I'm glad that uh
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien uh as well as Mr
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
Karen talked about uh you know what's
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
the cost of inaction
 
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
um and I think that
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
it'll be important for us to come back
 
01:10:44.689 --> 01:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
to the table I'm not sure there's any
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
specific research requests but I I do
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
think that we all bring with us
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
perspective and stories
 
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:54.260 align:start position:0%
you know qualitative and quantitative
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
data around uh the cost of us not uh
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
being able to to send something forward
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
to the legislature uh in January so
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
um it's good that we're we're you know
 
01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:11.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to model out some other
 
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
uh ideas and proposals we're going to
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
talk about Cola moving forward I think
 
01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
there's good sort of long-term
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
short-term uh
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
kind of actionable things that we can do
 
01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
but let's let's let's also figure out
 
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
what the what the impact of of inaction
 
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.810 align:start position:0%
what the what the impact of of inaction
is

01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
um which will hopefully
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
um Inspire us to move something forward
 
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.990 align:start position:0%
um Inspire us to move something forward
okay

01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
okay here we are the middle of September
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
we won't have the September revenue for
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
three weeks
 
01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:53.300 align:start position:0%
do we
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
I wanted to raise my hand for that
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
um thanks Senator gray for clarifying
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
your numbers are in that grid already
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
and I will add these two amendments into
 
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
that grid and resend it send a fresh
 
01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:19.850 align:start position:0%
that grid and resend it send a fresh
copy

01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
copy
 
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
um question came up earlier from
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner Fuller about how much more
 
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
members have been paying and
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
um without
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
I can give you a reasonable ballpark
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
um basically you know the contribution
 
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
rates for members went up two percent
 
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
for employees and teachers and a little
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
bit more for police and fire two and a
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
quarter two and a half but just just for
 
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
the sake of using round numbers if you
 
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
assume employee employees members are
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
paying two percent more the total
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
payroll uh in 2011 was 2.5 billion so
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
two percent of that is 50 million so you
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
know members through increased
 
01:12:59.330 --> 01:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
contributions were putting in about 50
 
01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:02.219 align:start position:0%
million more than you know increasing as
 
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
payroll grew over the the last 12 years
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal 22 we were just a little bit
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
over 3 billion so a little bit in excess
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
of 60 million so you're talking 10 or 12
 
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
years at 50 million so that's you know
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the ballpark what
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
you're looking at in terms of what
 
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
members have been contributing uh since
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
the rate the member contributions were
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
raised back in 2011 and
 
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
while it's not a complete one for one
 
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
every dollar the member puts in the
 
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
employer doesn't have to pay it's it's
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's pretty close but you know because
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
people withdraw and get their
 
01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
contributions back there is some some
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
some bleed out on those those member
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
contributions but
 
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
um you know that was that was one of the
 
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
things the increased member
 
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
contributions is what uh stabilized and
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
lowered the rates briefly uh back after
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
HP to change that plus the totality of
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
the benefit changes so just figured
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
you'd ask that so and I knew the answer
 
01:14:05.209 --> 01:14:05.219 align:start position:0%
um quite as the representative Wilhelm
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
you know the the short answer for you
 
01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
know the longer you wait to restore
 
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
benefits already you know for peep
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
service are already accrued the more
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost every year we had a
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
similar bill I think in 2018 or 19 to
 
01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
restore group two benefits more or less
 
01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
similar to uh 436 and I think it was the
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
unfunded was 140 million for the full
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
bolt and it was over 200 five years
 
01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
later when it came back up again in 2023
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
so the reason for that is when we talk
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
about what the unfunded liability is on
 
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
changes like this where it's actually
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
changing the benefits and reverse is
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
that that amount is what we should have
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
in the trust fund now had it been funded
 
01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
in an orally fashion over the past 12
 
01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.709 align:start position:0%
in an orally fashion over the past 12
years

01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
um so that that's that's how those those
 
01:14:58.850 --> 01:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
that's what those numbers are
 
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I hope I didn't make anything more
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
confusing I was I was trying to help and
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
and the last thing was in terms of um
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
retirement ages and and service there
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
was a chart we provided in advance of
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
the commission it may or may not be on
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
the website it's it's Service retirement
 
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
so over the last 10 years by group and
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
it's got the average age and average
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
service for the different member groups
 
01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
uh that doesn't obviously since it's
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
Service retirement it doesn't count
 
01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
people who choose to leave the
 
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
profession early
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
um it's only the retirees I don't have
 
01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
the numbers in front of me so I don't
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
want to cite them but they're out there
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay are there any more questions from
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin well we've got them in the hot
 
01:15:40.199 --> 01:15:42.530 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin well we've got them in the hot
seat

01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay I think not thank you very much
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you volunteering recognizing me

have a meeting before then to discuss
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%

01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:15.110 align:start position:0%
some other changes that people are going
to

01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%

01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
