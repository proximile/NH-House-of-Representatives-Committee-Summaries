the back of my head my working computers
 
00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:26.269 align:start position:0%
behind me so if I look at an amendment
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
or a bill you won't see my face you'll
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
see the back of my head pushing yes I'm
 
00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:36.139 align:start position:0%
I'm here in my home in Hampton my wife

yes he seems to have dropped off and I'm
 
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:50.270 align:start position:0%
hoping that she's rebooting and try
 
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:52.610 align:start position:0%
to enter again but I had we haven't
 
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.010 align:start position:0%
heard from her we tried calling and the
 
00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:57.020 align:start position:0%
phone went straight to voicemail so
 
00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
we're working on her we're not
 
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.070 align:start position:0%
forgetting her but she's not here right
 
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:10.250 align:start position:0%
now okay so I I will begin I just want
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
to outline where we are as the the
 
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:18.890 align:start position:0%
committee knows our responsibility as a
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
second committee the criminal justice
 
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
public safety committee is to take a
 
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:25.340 align:start position:0%
look at a bill that has passed a policy
 
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:27.410 align:start position:0%
committee and has passed the House had
 
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.010 align:start position:0%
been referred to us and to take a look
 
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:34.490 align:start position:0%
at the the fines or the penalties or the
 
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
punishment involved in it and make a
 
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:42.670 align:start position:0%
recommendation upon that we have three
 
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:49.580 align:start position:0%
bills that were in our possession as the
 
00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:51.860 align:start position:0%
time that the legislature froze up on
 
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
those on the 13th of time the
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
declaration of the state of emergency
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
was made by the governor that had not
 
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:01.670 align:start position:0%
been the subject had not had a a second
 
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:02.990 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
it is a public hearing for a second
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
committee bill is optional by tradition
 
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:12.500 align:start position:0%
the alleged criminal justice committee
 
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:17.150 align:start position:0%
has public hearings on second bills but
 
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:18.890 align:start position:0%
other committees do not I know that's
 
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:20.810 align:start position:0%
represented over of course is familiar
 
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.250 align:start position:0%
that it's the policy the Finance
 
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:23.660 align:start position:0%
Committee they don't have second
 
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
committee hearing bills on bills but
 
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:28.100 align:start position:0%
they move to a work session so what I
 
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:32.870 align:start position:0%
have done is I have waived the this the
 
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:36.290 align:start position:0%
second committee second public hearing
 
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:39.830 align:start position:0%
on a bill for those who don't know the
 
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.070 align:start position:0%
the sense is that a bill that has
 
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.290 align:start position:0%
already had a public hearing in a policy
 
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:46.460 align:start position:0%
committee that there was an opportunity
 
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:49.220 align:start position:0%
to have the public give and have input
 
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:52.910 align:start position:0%
to that what I've done today in the
 
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:56.750 align:start position:0%
instances of House bill 11 17 Hospital
 
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:01.820 align:start position:0%
1580 and House bill 1606 has I've
 
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:03.830 align:start position:0%
contacted the
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
chair of the policy committee and the
 
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:10.420 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill and alerted them to
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
be you know to the to the work session
 
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:16.970 align:start position:0%
that we're having here and as the the
 
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:19.340 align:start position:0%
chair of an extended an invitation to

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:24.020 align:start position:0%
work session and to provide briefly I
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
hope a little bit of introduction to to
 
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:29.300 align:start position:0%
the bill so that we can become familiar
 
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:31.970 align:start position:0%

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.020 align:start position:0%
presentation is made we will you know
 
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
function as we would in any in in a work
 
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:41.540 align:start position:0%
session that would be taking place in
 
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
the legislative office building we try
 
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
to ask questions to elicit information
 
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:47.870 align:start position:0%
to help us be in our debate and I know
 
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.250 align:start position:0%
that we're all going to be disciplined
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
with this it's new as we as we go
 
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:54.740 align:start position:0%
forward but with that I do look down at
 
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
the screen now and I noticed that
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:02.900 align:start position:0%

somewhere thank you okay great so with
 
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:44.030 align:start position:0%
this we're going to take up for the open
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
up the we're gonna take up as the first
 
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:47.180 align:start position:0%
bill in our work session
 
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:53.900 align:start position:0%
House bill 11 17 FN which is an act
 
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:55.850 align:start position:0%
relative to penalties the dog theft and
 
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:00.590 align:start position:0%
tampering with a dogs radio collar I I
 
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:04.150 align:start position:0%
know that the the sponsor of the bill
 
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:07.310 align:start position:0%
represent of Sullivan had raised his
 
00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
hand earlier and wished to be recognized
 
00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:11.870 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of the policy
 
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:14.710 align:start position:0%
committee I'm hoping that members of the
 
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:17.510 align:start position:0%
of the committee have had
 
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:20.990 align:start position:0%
chance to review the research piece that
 
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:24.230 align:start position:0%
was done and submitted to us but just
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
briefly what this bill does it makes
 
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:29.990 align:start position:0%
crime of dog theft a Class B felony and
 
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
it makes it a crime to remove certain
 
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:34.130 align:start position:0%
collars from dogs and a personally who
 
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:35.990 align:start position:0%
knowingly gives poisonous substance to a
 
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:37.730 align:start position:0%
dog with intent to the dog eating the
 
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:39.140 align:start position:0%
substance will be guilty of a Class B
 
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:45.110 align:start position:0%
felony and others with that I'm going to
 
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:51.830 align:start position:0%
ask representative Solomon and I also
 
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
believe I'm going to ask is represent
 
00:15:59.700 --> 00:15:59.710 align:start position:0%
comptoir here someplace
 
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:06.140 align:start position:0%
she find out if somebody from the
 
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
environment and Agriculture Committee
 
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:09.290 align:start position:0%

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:13.010 align:start position:0%

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:14.630 align:start position:0%
by presenting Goa then thank you I did
 
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:16.910 align:start position:0%

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:22.070 align:start position:0%
step in quickly recognize you to explain
 
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:23.210 align:start position:0%
to the committee and see if there any
 
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:25.460 align:start position:0%
questions then I'll follow that I'm
 
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:27.950 align:start position:0%
going to ask the environment
 
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:30.620 align:start position:0%

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:42.500 align:start position:0%
good to participate with your activities
 
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:46.310 align:start position:0%
I am representative Brian Sullivan from
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.870 align:start position:0%
I am representative Brian Sullivan from
Grantham

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
Grantham
 
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
and I sponsored the House bill 11:17 on
 
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:53.180 align:start position:0%
behalf of a constituent Dianne
 
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:56.540 align:start position:0%
Richardson a suspect is also listening
 
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.030 align:start position:0%
in and she requested this bill because
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
of the increasing prevalence of people
 
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:09.250 align:start position:0%
tampering with the electronic devices on
 
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:12.620 align:start position:0%
on various types of dogs many of them
 
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:15.650 align:start position:0%
being tracking or hunting dogs that are
 
00:17:18.699 --> 00:17:18.709 align:start position:0%
out in the woods and apparently some
 
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
folks don't approve of the legal
 
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:24.380 align:start position:0%
activity that these dogs and their
 
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:27.530 align:start position:0%
owners are engaged in and therefore give
 
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
a name
 
00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:35.029 align:start position:0%
increasing basis have been tampering
 
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:37.610 align:start position:0%
with the removing the collars damaging
 
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:40.730 align:start position:0%
the collars and sometimes stealing the
 
00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:46.789 align:start position:0%
dogs and this bill as amended by the
 
00:17:49.749 --> 00:17:49.759 align:start position:0%
environment and the Agriculture
 
00:17:53.529 --> 00:17:53.539 align:start position:0%
Committee increases the penalty from a
 
00:17:57.039 --> 00:17:57.049 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to a Class B felony and I
 
00:17:59.499 --> 00:17:59.509 align:start position:0%
believe there were some very nice
 
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:01.940 align:start position:0%
amendments done by the earlier committee
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
simplified the bill I think a
 
00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:05.809 align:start position:0%
streamlined it makes makes it work
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
better and I would also point out that
 
00:18:11.769 --> 00:18:11.779 align:start position:0%
not only is it hunting dogs that are
 
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:13.700 align:start position:0%
hunting or sporting dogs that are
 
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:16.700 align:start position:0%
involved but also people are using these
 
00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:19.700 align:start position:0%
collars now on on Fido their little
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
loved pets similar to representative
 
00:18:28.299 --> 00:18:28.309 align:start position:0%
Welch's snowball and they're they're
 
00:18:30.399 --> 00:18:30.409 align:start position:0%
putting these collars on in case the dog
 
00:18:32.769 --> 00:18:32.779 align:start position:0%
gets loose and it allows them to track
 
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:36.110 align:start position:0%
the dogs down using GPS you know the
 
00:18:41.649 --> 00:18:41.659 align:start position:0%
latest technology so I with that I'll
 
00:18:44.169 --> 00:18:44.179 align:start position:0%
step back and if there are questions I'd
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer them but I believe
 
00:18:50.619 --> 00:18:50.629 align:start position:0%
it's good bill that protects the
 
00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
property of dog owners thank you
 
00:18:59.759 --> 00:18:59.769 align:start position:0%
are there any hands up no okay
 
00:19:03.419 --> 00:19:03.429 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Salomon welcome
 
00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:08.299 align:start position:0%
represent gar you actually come to I
 
00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:15.379 align:start position:0%
would like to thank you rep recognizer
 
00:19:19.749 --> 00:19:19.759 align:start position:0%
observe Tompa hey thank you for letting
 
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:21.470 align:start position:0%
me speak Thank You mr. chair and
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
committee members this bill came forth
 
00:19:29.759 --> 00:19:29.769 align:start position:0%
because theft among dogs is on the rise
 
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:32.450 align:start position:0%
people think they're saving dogs by
 
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:35.450 align:start position:0%
removing their collars we have hunting
 
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:37.610 align:start position:0%
dogs that can be gone for two days
 
00:19:40.659 --> 00:19:40.669 align:start position:0%
because they're tracking the prey and
 
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:43.340 align:start position:0%
the owners have to keep going out
 
00:19:45.999 --> 00:19:46.009 align:start position:0%
but if a caller is removed they cannot
 
00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:47.929 align:start position:0%
locate that dog and it could go out and
 
00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:49.309 align:start position:0%
it has happened where they've run out
 
00:19:51.999 --> 00:19:52.009 align:start position:0%
into the road and gotten hit and the
 
00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:55.789 align:start position:0%
owner did not know I just spoke to my
 
00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:58.850 align:start position:0%
bed actually yesterday and he just
 
00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:00.830 align:start position:0%
bought a new collar for one of his dogs
 
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:02.870 align:start position:0%
it to the tune of fifteen hundred
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
dollars and that's just for a domestic
 
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:07.940 align:start position:0%
dog with the new technology that
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
represents Sullivan just spoke about
 
00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:13.129 align:start position:0%
these animals there is no really price
 
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:14.690 align:start position:0%
tag that you can put on a lot of these
 
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:16.940 align:start position:0%
animals on some of these hunting dogs
 
00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:19.129 align:start position:0%
you could pay five hundred or a thousand
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
dollars for them when you buy them but
 
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:28.730 align:start position:0%
they're worth a lot more than that and
 
00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:30.860 align:start position:0%
that is why we just chose to go with the
 
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:34.610 align:start position:0%
Class B felony and if anyone has any
 
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:36.590 align:start position:0%
questions we just wanted to simplify
 
00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:40.059 align:start position:0%
that bill and currently under the law
 
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:44.830 align:start position:0%
collars can be taken off without penalty
 
00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:51.169 align:start position:0%
thank you the questions the chair will
 
00:20:54.639 --> 00:20:54.649 align:start position:0%
ask one then what what was the the the
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
basis for setting it as a Class B felony
 
00:21:06.989 --> 00:21:06.999 align:start position:0%
well it is private property
 
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:09.470 align:start position:0%
most of these collars that people are
 
00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:15.289 align:start position:0%
removing are north of $500 people are
 
00:21:17.499 --> 00:21:17.509 align:start position:0%
also removing microchips
 
00:21:19.899 --> 00:21:19.909 align:start position:0%
which is a surgical procedure which does
 
00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:23.659 align:start position:0%
harm to an animal and should not at any
 
00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:27.519 align:start position:0%
at any time be removed unless it is for
 
00:21:30.609 --> 00:21:30.619 align:start position:0%
the health of the animal we've also put
 
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:31.940 align:start position:0%
in there that if an animal is in
 
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:36.740 align:start position:0%
imminent danger that law enforcement
 
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:39.830 align:start position:0%
does have the ability to remove that
 
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:42.830 align:start position:0%
collar without any penalties but what
 
00:21:44.919 --> 00:21:44.929 align:start position:0%
has been happening and it's about a two
 
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:47.090 align:start position:0%
million dot two million dogs a year are
 
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:51.860 align:start position:0%
being stolen it's big business and if we
 
00:21:53.859 --> 00:21:53.869 align:start position:0%
don't put some teeth into this it'll
 
00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:57.190 align:start position:0%
continue to happen and it is on the
 
00:21:59.620 --> 00:21:59.630 align:start position:0%
and we have people that feel like
 
00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:01.429 align:start position:0%
they're you know they think collars are
 
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:04.130 align:start position:0%
cruel or inserting a microchip into an
 
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
animal they shouldn't be able to do that
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
Mike my question right now what's the
 
00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:12.260 align:start position:0%
current penalty for stealing a dog right
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the penalty for
 
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:15.830 align:start position:0%
stealing a dog is but for taking a
 
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:18.290 align:start position:0%
collar or a tracking device off of a dog
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
or removing a microchip there is no
 
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:23.660 align:start position:0%
penalty I understand that I just thank
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry are there any other
 
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:33.650 align:start position:0%
questions are there any other has a hand
 
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:38.650 align:start position:0%
up mr. Welch oh sorry
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
he's um muted I am trying to unmute him
 
00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:49.669 align:start position:0%
I don't know why he's not unmuting there
 
00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:53.929 align:start position:0%
we go all right it says well the steals
 
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:55.820 align:start position:0%
are dogs shall be guilty of a Class B
 
00:22:59.169 --> 00:22:59.179 align:start position:0%
felony I think that's a little strong
 
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:01.790 align:start position:0%
for stealing a dog I mean I love my dogs
 
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:07.910 align:start position:0%
and I think a Class B felony is a little
 
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:10.870 align:start position:0%
bit of overkill on that particular
 
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:14.470 align:start position:0%
Romanova one it's a line for the bill I
 
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:18.230 align:start position:0%
would strongly recommend a Class A
 
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:23.030 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and again maybe this is
 
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:25.730 align:start position:0%
something we can talk about in our well
 
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:26.690 align:start position:0%
we haven't
 
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:28.490 align:start position:0%
I should make clear that after we
 
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:30.470 align:start position:0%
complete our work sessions today on
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
these three bills then we will move into
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
an exact session so I I hope asking
 
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:37.870 align:start position:0%
questions and not offering opinions
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
Thank You representative over oh thank
 
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.190 align:start position:0%
you mr. chairman can either you or
 
00:23:49.419 --> 00:23:49.429 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative Murphy refresh my
 
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:52.730 align:start position:0%
memory we had an animal bill earlier and
 
00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:54.860 align:start position:0%
we had a penalty in it and I can't
 
00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:56.900 align:start position:0%
remember what the committee decided what
 
00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:58.970 align:start position:0%
the penalty was and since I can't
 
00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:00.860 align:start position:0%
remember the number of the bill I can't
 
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:02.780 align:start position:0%
turn around and look it up either so can
 
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:05.890 align:start position:0%
one of you refresh my memory thank you
 
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:11.990 align:start position:0%
sure actually you know I'm going to look
 
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
it up right now I I believe that Julia
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
Steele is on the phone from the Humane
 
00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:23.660 align:start position:0%
Society and she was part of writing that
 
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:26.090 align:start position:0%
bill I think with representative Rogers
 
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:28.820 align:start position:0%
I'll have to look up the number but I do
 
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
I do remember if we were talking about
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
making it a felony for the purposeful
 
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:38.180 align:start position:0%
harm to an animal and we looked at
 
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:40.100 align:start position:0%
rewriting some of the language in the
 
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:43.340 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty bill so it was it was
 
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:47.170 align:start position:0%
considered a felony for and and that
 
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:50.950 align:start position:0%
that bill actually passed a house so
 
00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:53.630 align:start position:0%
they maybe we can talk about this
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
further at our exact session represent
 
00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:57.530 align:start position:0%
oh I'm not sure that we have tied on't
 
00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:58.790 align:start position:0%
have the ability right now but I
 
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
have the ability right now but I
understand

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:01.490 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
to the chair and to represent Murphy
 
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.010 align:start position:0%
that was House bill 1 5 6 0 did you have
 
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:18.290 align:start position:0%
more represent over thank you lieutenant
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
I was a boy who's your hand up ler a
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative a testament had a hand up
 
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:27.260 align:start position:0%
and I guess he put it down
 
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.010 align:start position:0%
representative Abbas has a hand up o
 
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
represent a bus and unmute is there we
 
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
go just answer the question right now
 
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:47.420 align:start position:0%
stealing a dog the penalty is they shall
 
00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:48.980 align:start position:0%
be guilty of a misdemeanor so my
 
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:53.810 align:start position:0%
understanding is the prosecutor or would
 
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:56.330 align:start position:0%
have the discretion to prosecute data as
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
a Class A or Class B misdemeanor
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say something expressly
 
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
stated or be in the RSA so any any other
 
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:10.370 align:start position:0%
questions of the committee for all the
 
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
sparrow has his hand up represent
 
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.070 align:start position:0%
sparrow has his hand up represent
baldesarra

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
baldesarra
 
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:17.510 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chairman my question is if
 
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:19.460 align:start position:0%
you use some of these bags are worth a
 
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:21.770 align:start position:0%
thousand to three thousand dollars if
 
00:26:23.299 --> 00:26:23.309 align:start position:0%
you were to steal
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
something else worth a thousand all
 
00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:27.299 align:start position:0%
about there's a net effect considered a
 
00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:33.870 align:start position:0%
felony also anything else that's a
 
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:36.690 align:start position:0%
question to whom to anyone now you guys
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
do the experts I'm asking you start
 
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
something in a store there was a
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
thousand of more is there a price
 
00:26:48.889 --> 00:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
difference justify there are I do not
 
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:00.450 align:start position:0%
have my question or not know I represent
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
Boyd has his hand up I don't know I'm
 
00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:06.289 align:start position:0%
separate thank you I thank you to answer
 
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:10.710 align:start position:0%
this question it's mine they would have
 
00:27:14.539 --> 00:27:14.549 align:start position:0%
to charge the specific charge available
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
so it is a crime and makes it a
 
00:27:20.499 --> 00:27:20.509 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for theft of a dog with no
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
no increase for value of the dog or not
 
00:27:25.369 --> 00:27:25.379 align:start position:0%
they have to charge the misdemeanor they
 
00:27:26.749 --> 00:27:26.759 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to just go ahead and
 
00:27:28.369 --> 00:27:28.379 align:start position:0%
call it property when there's a more
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
specific charge available so right now
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
as it stands regardless of the value of
 
00:27:35.889 --> 00:27:35.899 align:start position:0%
the dog it would be a misdemeanor okay
 
00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:40.769 align:start position:0%
are there other hands up Mike Murphy's
 
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:43.580 align:start position:0%
hand is up and also out in the attendees
 
00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:46.249 align:start position:0%
representative comptoir and
 
00:27:48.889 --> 00:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
representative Ellen Reid and Jennifer
 
00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:51.809 align:start position:0%
Smith all have their hands up you know I
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
just would like to kind of caution we
 
00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:57.570 align:start position:0%
are under kind of we are under a time
 
00:27:59.060 --> 00:27:59.070 align:start position:0%
constraint for all of our work today
 
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:01.710 align:start position:0%
that we have to be done by 1:30 so I put
 
00:28:02.899 --> 00:28:02.909 align:start position:0%
that out there and ask people to be
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
disciplined but go ahead grab some
 
00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:20.059 align:start position:0%
Testament Testament his hand was up okay
 
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
it would not be unusual for a dog in
 
00:28:25.879 --> 00:28:25.889 align:start position:0%
today's climate to be worth well over a
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
thousand close to three thousand dollars
 
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
I looked at getting a new pup with my
 
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.250 align:start position:0%
boo BA and that was close to three
 
00:28:37.239 --> 00:28:37.249 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:40.970 align:start position:0%
I think that just the cost of that would
 
00:28:44.109 --> 00:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
get you into the felony range again I
 
00:28:46.779 --> 00:28:46.789 align:start position:0%
just want to you know remind the
 
00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:48.409 align:start position:0%
committee we will have an exact session
 
00:28:50.649 --> 00:28:50.659 align:start position:0%
when we can discuss and offer our you
 
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:52.220 align:start position:0%
know perspectives and opinions and help
 
00:28:53.769 --> 00:28:53.779 align:start position:0%
guide us but we're trying to elicit
 
00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:55.940 align:start position:0%
information now from people who are
 
00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:58.220 align:start position:0%

00:29:02.499 --> 00:29:02.509 align:start position:0%
conversation later who else is a hint of
 
00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:04.580 align:start position:0%

00:29:06.669 --> 00:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
Bourdonnais have their hand side and
 
00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:12.230 align:start position:0%

00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%

00:29:20.739 --> 00:29:20.749 align:start position:0%
theft theft of value get DP of services
 
00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:24.860 align:start position:0%

waiting in line I know that we have I
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
realize that we're not in the same
 
00:29:39.009 --> 00:29:39.019 align:start position:0%
situation we would be in a work session
 
00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:42.409 align:start position:0%
in the Statehouse because this is all
 
00:29:44.289 --> 00:29:44.299 align:start position:0%
brand-new but we're trying to get
 
00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:45.409 align:start position:0%
through represent Murphy do you have
 
00:29:47.379 --> 00:29:47.389 align:start position:0%

people are the participants who wish to
 
00:30:09.009 --> 00:30:09.019 align:start position:0%

next
 
00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:20.629 align:start position:0%
representative Comptoir represent
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
contrast sorry Rosanna Kahwa made it is
 
00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:37.429 align:start position:0%
because that um the callers alone were
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
upwards north of $1500 for a lot of
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
these dogs and we cannot place a value
 
00:30:47.409 --> 00:30:47.419 align:start position:0%
in looking at the law and talking with
 
00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:50.370 align:start position:0%
OLS a class beef
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
is in line with the dollar amount that
 
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:57.570 align:start position:0%
would be would make that the class be
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
phony so that's why we chose the Class B
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
felony as the punishment thank you thank
 
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%

the meeting because there was an
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
incorrect meeting ID number put listed
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
in the house calendar and I wasn't sure
 
00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:40.049 align:start position:0%
if other people who were supposed to get
 
00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:41.309 align:start position:0%
in had gotten in so I just wanted to
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
clarify that point it wasn't about this
 
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:47.370 align:start position:0%

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.049 align:start position:0%
share with us as part of the work
session

00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:56.490 align:start position:0%
if not we'll I'll wait a minute and Isha
 
00:31:59.539 --> 00:31:59.549 align:start position:0%
gory has a has a hand up I'm gonna wreck
 
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.010 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
recognized him to talk and now I don't
 
00:32:31.539 --> 00:32:31.549 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
chief shibori there we go
 
00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:42.020 align:start position:0%

00:32:46.519 --> 00:32:46.529 align:start position:0%
no apparently his audio is not working
 
00:32:48.919 --> 00:32:48.929 align:start position:0%
man he's okay you're you know he's
 
00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:51.289 align:start position:0%
allowed to talk and he's unmuted so I
 
00:32:53.529 --> 00:32:53.539 align:start position:0%
don't know why we're not hearing them
 
00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:57.870 align:start position:0%
all right well I think we'll just kind
 
00:32:59.899 --> 00:32:59.909 align:start position:0%
of we'll we'll wrap up this this work
 
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:02.610 align:start position:0%
session on house for 1117 we'll take it
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
up and exact later on
 
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:18.500 align:start position:0%
an act regulating the use of unmanned
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
aircraft systems this bill it's it's a
 
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:26.130 align:start position:0%
drum bill that we're somewhat familiar
 
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:27.930 align:start position:0%
with I know in this committee we've had
 
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:31.710 align:start position:0%
we reviewed these in the past I wanna I
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
believe that represent Brody is going to
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of the sponsor
 
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
represented McGuire and also the
 
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:43.650 align:start position:0%
committee right
 
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:46.470 align:start position:0%
I'm represented Rhoda and representative
 
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:48.690 align:start position:0%
McGuire are both in these week okay
 
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:53.850 align:start position:0%
hands up right now represent McGuire
 
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
would the glider I'm the prime sponsor
 
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:11.250 align:start position:0%
of 1580 and I'm also on EDMA where this
 
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
bill went to the first committee it has
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
been significantly amended since the
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
original version and so I'd like to just
 
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.210 align:start position:0%
point out a few of the things it defines
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
what an unmanned aircraft system is
 
00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:34.820 align:start position:0%
based on the federal definition it
 
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:40.230 align:start position:0%
requires a warrant for law enforcement
 
00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
to use a use a drone and it penalizes
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
putting weapons on a drone or if they
 
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
discharge it such a weapon it was
 
00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:56.970 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me after this bill passed
 
00:34:59.480 --> 00:34:59.490 align:start position:0%
the house that it might be a good idea
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
to add a point of intent to that section
 
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:07.590 align:start position:0%
because you don't know what a weapon is
 
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
until it's used as a weapon there are
 
00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:12.230 align:start position:0%
some people that have drones with
 
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:14.730 align:start position:0%
flamethrowers on them that they use for
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
pest control and
 
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.130 align:start position:0%
you know the naive person might think it
 
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:22.590 align:start position:0%
flamethrowers an obvious weapon but in
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
this case it's a tool so but that I
 
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:26.610 align:start position:0%
think is something that your committee
 
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:28.650 align:start position:0%
is more qualified to deal with them and
 
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:34.370 align:start position:0%
I do in this bill clearly gives the
 
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation there are
 
00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:41.910 align:start position:0%
not experiencing with the FAA and making
 
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
and getting new hampshire infrastructure
 
00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:48.860 align:start position:0%
designated as critical infrastructure on
 
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:51.450 align:start position:0%
previous bills as representable the
 
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:53.850 align:start position:0%
sarah was pointed out it was thought
 
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:55.710 align:start position:0%
that you know like the prison could just
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
go appeal to the faa but they don't
 
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:00.090 align:start position:0%
normally do that the Bureau of
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics is is capable and familiar
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
with it they have the skills and the
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
connections and they'll be able to do it
 
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
more effectively and the other thing is
 
00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:14.190 align:start position:0%
that because most of the issues we've
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
had from our constituents regarding
 
00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
drones has been with not with
 
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
professionals using them but with your
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
neighbor play flying a drum that he got
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
for Christmas around and hovering around
 
00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
the house and spying in your kitchen
 
00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
window so to deal with that and to
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that the local police can
 
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:36.690 align:start position:0%
investigate that sort of thing we
 
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
increase the penalty for violation of
 
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
privacy in RSA 644 : 9 by making it a
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
Class A misdemeanor rather than an
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
unspecified misdemeanor for violation of
 
00:36:59.330 --> 00:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
privacy if they use a drone and that was
 
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
the main thing that affects your I'll
 
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:08.130 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I can any questions
 
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:19.650 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire oh thank you thank you
 
00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:23.490 align:start position:0%
mr. chair I'm gonna be very brief we had
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
five subcommittee meetings on this and
 
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:32.430 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:36.430 align:start position:0%
everyone at the end of the Kim the
 
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:37.780 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting including
 
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:41.470 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire seemed seemed
 
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:43.450 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the stage of the bill
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
when we passed it in our committee thank
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
you any other questions
 
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:53.950 align:start position:0%
representative Bourdonnais has his hand
 
00:37:59.820 --> 00:37:59.830 align:start position:0%
of burning seconds children we all
 
00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:02.670 align:start position:0%
receive a letter from insurance
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
representatives yesterday looking for an
 
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
exceptions were you steering for
 
00:38:11.849 --> 00:38:11.859 align:start position:0%
insurance investigations was that
 
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.030 align:start position:0%
considered as part of this bill yes
 
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:20.170 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.010 align:start position:0%
they raised their concerns and they are
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
part of the exception that also includes
 
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:30.130 align:start position:0%
utilities because utilities use this to
 
00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
check to see if their lines are broken
 
00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:36.940 align:start position:0%
at any point so they're part of that
 
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
group represent Bonnie are you waving
 
00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:49.180 align:start position:0%
yes I am oh yes so if there are making
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
these exceptions are there other
 
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:54.580 align:start position:0%
exceptions that we should consider
 
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:00.190 align:start position:0%
let's just be ready for primetime is
 
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:08.650 align:start position:0%
that a question I'm not sure that you
 
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
can make the exceptions in the bill are
 
00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:23.170 align:start position:0%
you know check their work I don't think
 
00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:25.060 align:start position:0%
that there I think it would be very
 
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:27.730 align:start position:0%
difficult to itemize every exception in
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
the bill this this representative of why
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
I have a comment on that sorry do you
 
00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:39.580 align:start position:0%
want me to get representing my lawyer
 
00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:41.589 align:start position:0%
back your Everett yes please
 
00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:43.890 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
00:39:46.999 --> 00:39:47.009 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that specific issue was
 
00:39:49.039 --> 00:39:49.049 align:start position:0%
not brought to the subcommittee and the
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
first I saw of it was late yesterday
 
00:39:53.749 --> 00:39:53.759 align:start position:0%
afternoon when I saw the email I think
 
00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:58.230 align:start position:0%
that the bill clearly exempts using a
 
00:40:00.979 --> 00:40:00.989 align:start position:0%
drone on your own property or with the
 
00:40:05.539 --> 00:40:05.549 align:start position:0%
permission of the of the landowner so I
 
00:40:09.319 --> 00:40:09.329 align:start position:0%
think that their point of you know
 
00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:11.910 align:start position:0%
specifically investigating fraud is
 
00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:15.089 align:start position:0%
something that the is a reasonable
 
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:19.410 align:start position:0%
exception and I would support that in
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
the Senate since that's where they said
 
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.130 align:start position:0%
they would like to have the details
 
00:40:27.259 --> 00:40:27.269 align:start position:0%
dealt with I perhaps neglected to state
 
00:40:31.239 --> 00:40:31.249 align:start position:0%
from the process that's been adopted for
 
00:40:34.579 --> 00:40:34.589 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this type of
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
electronic meaning and the the process
 
00:40:41.509 --> 00:40:41.519 align:start position:0%
by which a bill that we will consider is
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
amended is is this a proposed amendment
 
00:40:49.509 --> 00:40:49.519 align:start position:0%
for a bill that will be the subject of
 
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:51.930 align:start position:0%
consideration at a work session or an
 
00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:55.710 align:start position:0%
exec session virtually under this ritual
 
00:40:59.239 --> 00:40:59.249 align:start position:0%
circumstances had to be submitted to has
 
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:02.930 align:start position:0%
to be submitted to OLS 72 hours before
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
the notice for the public hearing and
 
00:41:10.489 --> 00:41:10.499 align:start position:0%
has to be posted on the website 24 hours
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
the general core information website 24
 
00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:15.390 align:start position:0%
hours and further as we'll get into
 
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:17.970 align:start position:0%
later a bill that will come before a
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee an amendment that comes before
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
a committee has to be in the name of a
 
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
member of the committee for it to be
 
00:41:27.049 --> 00:41:27.059 align:start position:0%
brought forward that's that's what
 
00:41:29.269 --> 00:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's how that's the protocol that
 
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:31.170 align:start position:0%
we're operating under it now so I'll
 
00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:33.980 align:start position:0%
just say that to the extent that I
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate representing McGuire's
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
suggestion that perhaps the Senate would
 
00:41:39.859 --> 00:41:39.869 align:start position:0%
address this if we want to proceed for
 
00:41:41.809 --> 00:41:41.819 align:start position:0%
but I will say that we are not able
 
00:41:44.239 --> 00:41:44.249 align:start position:0%
today anyhow to take up any amendment
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
that has not already been submitted mr.
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
chairman we have representative Muse and
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
abbess with their hands up represent
 
00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:54.980 align:start position:0%
mousse followed by represent Ravis
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm gonna be eating myself well I
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
had a question for the sponsors as to
 
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:06.450 align:start position:0%
whether or not anyone has or anyone at
 
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:08.850 align:start position:0%
the hearing who was a professional
 
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:11.510 align:start position:0%
photographer actually testified because
 
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:16.010 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
photographing or recording an individual
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
without that individuals consent for the
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
purpose of publishing or otherwise
 
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:25.650 align:start position:0%
publicly disseminating information like
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
a photograph is something that virtually
 
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:31.590 align:start position:0%
anyone who owns a camera does so it
 
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:34.470 align:start position:0%
looks a little broad to me and I'm just
 
00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:37.670 align:start position:0%
curious if you've got feedback for many
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
professional photographers or
 
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:46.050 align:start position:0%
photographers in general yes the there
 
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:49.230 align:start position:0%
were there were a number of
 
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:53.010 align:start position:0%
photographers involved and that I said
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
this bill was significantly amended by
 
00:42:59.680 --> 00:42:59.690 align:start position:0%
the first committee and they were
 
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
relatively accepting of the final
 
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:04.770 align:start position:0%
language they would probably like to
 
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
have a bigger exception for them but all
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
things considered we the committee and
 
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:13.110 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee figured that we would
 
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:16.890 align:start position:0%
get a sketch of the bill that is to get
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
the basic points that they shouldn't be
 
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:22.170 align:start position:0%
out there spying on people but if
 
00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:24.770 align:start position:0%
they're to you know doing news or taking
 
00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:27.270 align:start position:0%
you know pictures of real estate which
 
00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
is one of the main uses for drones that
 
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:34.170 align:start position:0%
they do not they're not bad thank you
 
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:40.290 align:start position:0%
represent us thank you and this is a
 
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
question for any one of the bill
 
00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:45.990 align:start position:0%
sponsors so I think I'm looking at the
 
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:47.670 align:start position:0%
right amendment page two lines one to
 
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:51.570 align:start position:0%
five discusses anamur you know an
 
00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:53.130 align:start position:0%
exception where you know emergency
 
00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:55.830 align:start position:0%
response you know for safety reasons or
 
00:43:59.570 --> 00:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
law enforcement investigations so in
 
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:02.010 align:start position:0%
that scenario you know law enforcement
 
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:04.410 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require a warrant and still
 
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:06.390 align:start position:0%
would be able to use these under what I
 
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:08.010 align:start position:0%
would say exigent circumstances is that
 
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.290 align:start position:0%
would say exigent circumstances is that
correct

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:14.530 align:start position:0%
correct is there any anything in the law
 
00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:17.860 align:start position:0%
already that addresses law enforcement's
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
use when it comes to unmanned aircrafts
 
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:23.620 align:start position:0%
new hampshire desert because i have a
 
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:28.350 align:start position:0%
policy concerning this right now the the
 
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
policy is the ruling of the faa and so
 
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
the state police was an intricate part
 
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:41.310 align:start position:0%
of rewriting this bill so they are
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
they're satisfied with the way the bill
 
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:47.230 align:start position:0%
reads they had a significant amount of
 
00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:49.930 align:start position:0%
input in the law enforcement portion of
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
it and represented McGuire has her hand
 
00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:57.790 align:start position:0%
up I don't know if you want to hear
 
00:44:59.100 --> 00:44:59.110 align:start position:0%
every time ago I and then I see
 
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:00.730 align:start position:0%
represent Baltazar and a her and have
 
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:04.180 align:start position:0%
their hands up - thank you thank you mr.
 
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:07.090 align:start position:0%
chair the an answer to a question yes
 
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
the state police have a drone unit they
 
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
have rules on how it is to be used and
 
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
they were very insistent that the normal
 
00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:21.820 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence apply to anything
 
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:24.210 align:start position:0%
that's produced with a drone and they
 
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:28.060 align:start position:0%
after we modified the bill they're very
 
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:30.010 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy with this amendment they
 
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:32.530 align:start position:0%
say their operations will all comply
 
00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:35.970 align:start position:0%
with this with this if it becomes law
 
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:38.890 align:start position:0%
maybe one ball - Sarah Thank You mr.
 
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:40.810 align:start position:0%
chairman I was reading through the bill
 
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:42.550 align:start position:0%
here and trying to find is there an
 
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
here and trying to find is there an
exception

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:43.390 align:start position:0%
exception
 
00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
like for instance I put in a GIS
 
00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:49.150 align:start position:0%
Commission in the state and cities and
 
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
towns use drones to fly other properties
 
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:56.260 align:start position:0%
when they do their you know check on you
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
know for the data they need for the GIS
 
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:05.890 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:09.010 align:start position:0%
every time a McGuire recorder yes Thank
 
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
You mr. chair yes it's online page 2
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
line 10 that would fall under incidental
 
00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:21.460 align:start position:0%
images of private property so that yes
 
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:25.540 align:start position:0%
they can fly over over the town and and
 
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:29.230 align:start position:0%
mark the boundaries but they can't take
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
pictures of the sunbathers in the
 
00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:35.430 align:start position:0%
backyard for example Hearn
 
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
just uh I guess either corner or
 
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:41.380 align:start position:0%
whatever are we we have this for just
 
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:43.390 align:start position:0%
for penalties correct that's correct
 
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:45.790 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just know why we're getting so
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
in depth into the thing where we're just
 
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:48.340 align:start position:0%
supposed to discussing whether or not
 
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
the penalty is sufficient or not I
 
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
that is our focus I perhaps have allowed
 
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:00.700 align:start position:0%
a little bit information I think people
 
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:02.530 align:start position:0%
may have questions to help them
 
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:04.390 align:start position:0%
understand the bill so they can make an
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation as to whether or not the
 
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:08.110 align:start position:0%
penalty for violating that is
 
00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:11.980 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not so chairman the only
 
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:13.900 align:start position:0%
other hand I see now is representative
 
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
Rhoda object Radha I'm willing to I just
 
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:21.550 align:start position:0%
want to make the same comment that
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative of our I made was that
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
page 2 line 10 instead of it's
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
incidental images of private property is
 
00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
incidental images of private property is
all-encompassing

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:31.570 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing
 
00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:33.550 align:start position:0%
I mean encompasses a lot of the things
 
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:35.110 align:start position:0%
that also encompasses I know
 
00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:37.390 align:start position:0%
representative hunt had asked me about
 
00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
the insurance portion of it and all that
 
00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:48.430 align:start position:0%
I think falls under line 10 and that's
 
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:50.170 align:start position:0%
all I'm gonna say thank you for again
 
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:53.970 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak anyone else
 
00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:57.910 align:start position:0%
right we will conclude the work session
 
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:03.390 align:start position:0%
on House bill 1580 and we will take up
 
00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
House bill 16:06 an act relative to
 
00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:14.230 align:start position:0%
cruelty to a wild animal fish a wild
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
bird and I again I guess I will
 
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.940 align:start position:0%
bird and I again I guess I will
recognize

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:19.950 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:22.660 align:start position:0%
representative Ellen Reid the sponsor of
 
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:27.610 align:start position:0%
1606 Thank You mr. chair can you hear me
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
yes yes excellent thank you for the
 
00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:32.590 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ellen Reed
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
representing Newmarket in new fields so
 
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:37.900 align:start position:0%
1606 is a strongly bipartisan bill I
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look at the list of
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors what it does is it creates a
 
00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:45.250 align:start position:0%
common sense criminal penalty to protect
 
00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:48.610 align:start position:0%
wildlife from those who would inflict
 
00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:50.860 align:start position:0%
pain and suffering gratuitously for the
 
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:52.810 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of inflicting pain and
 
00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:56.170 align:start position:0%
suffering we have laws like this to
 
00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:58.570 align:start position:0%
prevent this kind of senseless torture
 
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:01.030 align:start position:0%
of captive animals but we are one of
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
only five states that has no law to
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
protect this kind of activity against
 
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:08.980 align:start position:0%
wildlife so 45 other states have laws
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
like this already on the books and have
 
00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:13.270 align:start position:0%
had these laws long-standing as so as it
 
00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
currently exists in New Hampshire if
 
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:18.010 align:start position:0%
someone were to say and I use this as a
 
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:20.290 align:start position:0%
because it's a real example ghosts that
 
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:23.110 align:start position:0%
a raccoon on fire in the woods there's
 
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:25.270 align:start position:0%
almost nothing that our law enforcement
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
can do in regards to that so and this is
 
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:31.510 align:start position:0%
you know we had this discrepancy between
 
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
captive animal law and the lack of law
 
00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:38.290 align:start position:0%
to protect wildlife in spite of the know
 
00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:41.380 align:start position:0%
that wildlife has all the same nervous
 
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
systems all the same capacity for pain
 
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:46.300 align:start position:0%
and suffering as captive animals do so
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go through the brief history
 
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:52.930 align:start position:0%
and walk through the the details of this
 
00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:55.690 align:start position:0%
bill in short I appreciate we just
 
00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:58.030 align:start position:0%
trying to keep a focus on the on the
 
00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:02.260 align:start position:0%
panel team we are sure so I can yeah I
 
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:05.770 align:start position:0%
can skip to that piece so I wanted to go
 
00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:07.780 align:start position:0%
through the wording in the penalty so
 
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:10.390 align:start position:0%
first of all cruelty I know that from
 
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:11.830 align:start position:0%
speaking to some people there is
 
00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:13.660 align:start position:0%
concerned that maybe the definition of
 
00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:15.130 align:start position:0%
cruelty might be too nebulous what
 
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:17.170 align:start position:0%
constitutes cruelty so first of all the
 
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:18.700 align:start position:0%
word cruelty only appears in this bill
 
00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:21.220 align:start position:0%
as a heading and I did so it's not in
 
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:23.290 align:start position:0%
any functioning piece of the bill itself
 
00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
and I did check with the lawyers at all
 
00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:29.140 align:start position:0%
of us that there's no that the headings
 
00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:31.660 align:start position:0%
are not any kind of functional piece of
 
00:50:33.609 --> 00:50:33.619 align:start position:0%
the bill so
 
00:50:35.319 --> 00:50:35.329 align:start position:0%
we could we could name this heading
 
00:50:36.519 --> 00:50:36.529 align:start position:0%
George and it wouldn't make a difference
 
00:50:39.339 --> 00:50:39.349 align:start position:0%
so the word cruelty in of itself is not
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
in the legal language of the bill the
 
00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:44.630 align:start position:0%
language that is used is identical to
 
00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:47.660 align:start position:0%
the current animal captive animal abuse
 
00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:51.940 align:start position:0%
statute so we are using long used
 
00:50:54.489 --> 00:50:54.499 align:start position:0%
language that is defined that is how we
 
00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:56.690 align:start position:0%
define animal cruelty for captive
 
00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:00.950 align:start position:0%
animals for for wild animals and that is
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
specifically to beat cruelly with
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
torture mutilate and again this has
 
00:51:08.769 --> 00:51:08.779 align:start position:0%
decades of case precedent so the
 
00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:10.460 align:start position:0%
definition of wildlife I also wanted to
 
00:51:12.489 --> 00:51:12.499 align:start position:0%
very briefly touch on that the current
 
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:14.140 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty statute that we have
 
00:51:17.019 --> 00:51:17.029 align:start position:0%
define that the animals are protected
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
are for domesticated or captive animals
 
00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:21.890 align:start position:0%
so here instead of using the word
 
00:51:23.799 --> 00:51:23.809 align:start position:0%
wildlife which includes things like fish
 
00:51:26.259 --> 00:51:26.269 align:start position:0%
eggs and other things we don't see as
 
00:51:30.569 --> 00:51:30.579 align:start position:0%
being able to suffer the very specific
 
00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:33.470 align:start position:0%
wording here is wild animal fish or wild
 
00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:35.869 align:start position:0%
bird so we have worked very closely with
 
00:51:37.329 --> 00:51:37.339 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Fish and Game Department
 
00:51:40.569 --> 00:51:40.579 align:start position:0%
for the last two years on this language
 
00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:43.700 align:start position:0%
there's been a long time in drafting and
 
00:51:46.329 --> 00:51:46.339 align:start position:0%
I believe both the legal counsel for New
 
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game Paul Sanderson
 
00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:49.730 align:start position:0%
who drafted the bill as well as Colonel
 
00:51:51.039 --> 00:51:51.049 align:start position:0%
Jordan who is the head of law
 
00:51:52.329 --> 00:51:52.339 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Fish and Game are both
 
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
on and can answer more questions but we
 
00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:57.650 align:start position:0%
basically built this bill according to
 
00:51:59.470 --> 00:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
their input and they actually are the
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
ones that drafted that so the definition
 
00:52:04.029 --> 00:52:04.039 align:start position:0%
of wildlife and all of that is and I do
 
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:05.930 align:start position:0%
encourage you to to recognize them to
 
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:06.980 align:start position:0%
answer questions
 
00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:09.950 align:start position:0%
so the actual penalty piece so we have
 
00:52:13.269 --> 00:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
two criminal culpability States out of
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
the four-color bility states so
 
00:52:18.819 --> 00:52:18.829 align:start position:0%
purposely to purposely engage in this
 
00:52:21.249 --> 00:52:21.259 align:start position:0%
activity would be a Class B felony as
 
00:52:23.739 --> 00:52:23.749 align:start position:0%
you know that is for the absolute most
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
egregious cases the really gut-wrenching
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
horrible you know newsworthy cases where
 
00:52:31.839 --> 00:52:31.849 align:start position:0%
prosecution can prove intent which is
 
00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:34.190 align:start position:0%
incredibly hard to prove in a court of
 
00:52:35.799 --> 00:52:35.809 align:start position:0%
law you know you have to get evidence of
 
00:52:37.839 --> 00:52:37.849 align:start position:0%
planning and what have you and then
 
00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:40.190 align:start position:0%
originally the the other culpability
 
00:52:43.359 --> 00:52:43.369 align:start position:0%
state we had said it recklessly to kind
 
00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
of be as protective as possible of
 
00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:49.700 align:start position:0%
accidents but actually on the advice of
 
00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:52.610 align:start position:0%
the department in Colonel Jordan it came
 
00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:55.340 align:start position:0%
to our attention that actually those who
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
get intoxicated and then were to go out
 
00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:00.980 align:start position:0%
and participate in cruelty to wildlife
 
00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:03.890 align:start position:0%
that those people would not be able to
 
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:06.530 align:start position:0%
be prosecuted unless we used negligently
 
00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:08.630 align:start position:0%
so we reduced that down to negligently
 
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:10.700 align:start position:0%
specifically to allow the prosecution of
 
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:12.020 align:start position:0%
people who were engaging in this
 
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:16.310 align:start position:0%
behavior while intoxicated and that is
 
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:18.260 align:start position:0%
an unspecified misdemeanor again to
 
00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:22.430 align:start position:0%
allow prosecution discretion so in terms
 
00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:24.020 align:start position:0%
of the hunting community again we worked
 
00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:26.270 align:start position:0%
closely with members of the hunting
 
00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:28.070 align:start position:0%
community again I ask you to look at my
 
00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:30.110 align:start position:0%
list of co-sponsors we've excluded
 
00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:31.940 align:start position:0%
everything under Title 18 which is the
 
00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:33.620 align:start position:0%
fish and game titles that includes any
 
00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:36.050 align:start position:0%
activity even if it were to be
 
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:37.610 align:start position:0%
considered cruel if it's done while
 
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:40.370 align:start position:0%
engaging in the lawful practice anything
 
00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:42.260 align:start position:0%
lawful under Title 18 so it's hunting
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
fishing trapping but also pest
 
00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:46.490 align:start position:0%
management nuisance animal management
 
00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:49.100 align:start position:0%
that's all exempted and in addition to
 
00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:51.620 align:start position:0%
that with the amendment that the Fish
 
00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:54.530 align:start position:0%
and Game Committee passed we've added an
 
00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.030 align:start position:0%
additional layer of protection for the
 
00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:58.190 align:start position:0%
huntin community so it's not only title
 
00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:00.380 align:start position:0%
is tie late-teen exempted but it's also
 
00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:03.470 align:start position:0%
an affirmative defense and as you know
 
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:05.420 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense means that even if
 
00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:07.070 align:start position:0%
the prosecution can prove the act itself
 
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:09.790 align:start position:0%
if the defense can prove that they were
 
00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:13.670 align:start position:0%
engaged in one of these activities that
 
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:17.150 align:start position:0%
the jury would be directed to acquit and
 
00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:18.860 align:start position:0%
because of that process really helps
 
00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.070 align:start position:0%
prevent any kind of I just want I think
 
00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
you've made the point a quick question
 
00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:31.550 align:start position:0%
is the penalty for wild animals the same
 
00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
as it is for captive animals now so so
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
the animal cruelty statute for captive
 
00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:40.790 align:start position:0%
animals is first there's a lot of pieces
 
00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:42.650 align:start position:0%
of that that would not even apply to
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
wildlife first of all things like you
 
00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:46.340 align:start position:0%
know negligence in terms of not
 
00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:47.660 align:start position:0%
providing housing or not providing
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
medical care or food or what have you so
 
00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:51.080 align:start position:0%
none of that is in here the piece that
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
has to do with actually physically
 
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:55.010 align:start position:0%
abusing captive animals and this
 
00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
actually goes back to the previous
 
00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:58.190 align:start position:0%
conversation you had on the previous
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:59.380 align:start position:0%
conversation you had on the previous
bill

00:54:59.380 --> 00:54:59.390 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:55:02.079 --> 00:55:02.089 align:start position:0%
representative Rogers bill recently
 
00:55:04.539 --> 00:55:04.549 align:start position:0%
increased which did pass your committee
 
00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:07.250 align:start position:0%
I believe increased the penalty for
 
00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:09.349 align:start position:0%
causing the death of an animal up to a
 
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
felony so this is this doesn't have to
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
do with causing death this is
 
00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:15.410 align:start position:0%
specifically about torturing an animal
 
00:55:19.779 --> 00:55:19.789 align:start position:0%
and it is on par with the current animal
 
00:55:21.759 --> 00:55:21.769 align:start position:0%
cruelty statue for captive animals the
 
00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:24.890 align:start position:0%
the difference is that for the captive
 
00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:26.690 align:start position:0%
animal statute it's repeated offenses
 
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:29.450 align:start position:0%
that cause a felony whereas here it's
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
the super egregious purposeful and there
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
were we had four hours of testimony
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
thank you I realized that we thank you I
 
00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
respectfully I think that's fine we if
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan if you have somebody else
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
from Fish and Game who is here who wants
 
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:49.010 align:start position:0%
to be recognized I recognize that moment
 
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:50.510 align:start position:0%
I thank you I don't know there may be
 
00:55:52.269 --> 00:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
some questions for you but I want to ask
 
00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:53.660 align:start position:0%
the question if they are here to
 
00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
participate and ask them to speak up and
 
00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:57.380 align:start position:0%
have members of the committee ask any
 
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:07.390 align:start position:0%
questions they might have yes awesome
 
00:56:14.999 --> 00:56:15.009 align:start position:0%
does he wish to address it ready to go
 
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chairman be happy to
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee
 
00:56:21.579 --> 00:56:21.589 align:start position:0%
members might have okay does the
 
00:56:28.779 --> 00:56:28.789 align:start position:0%
committee have any questions thank you I
 
00:56:30.819 --> 00:56:30.829 align:start position:0%
quit just a quick question I know
 
00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:33.890 align:start position:0%
everything was covered as far as hunting
 
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
and fishing I just wanted to be extra
 
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:38.900 align:start position:0%
double careful with regard to for
 
00:56:40.779 --> 00:56:40.789 align:start position:0%
example ice fishing where we use one
 
00:56:43.299 --> 00:56:43.309 align:start position:0%
fish to bait to catch another fish is
 
00:56:45.759 --> 00:56:45.769 align:start position:0%
that still covered in other words from
 
00:56:46.539 --> 00:56:46.549 align:start position:0%
these shiners
 
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:49.190 align:start position:0%
I can't be charged with cruelty to the
 
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:50.420 align:start position:0%
shiner because I'm trying to catch
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
another fish yes representative you are
 
00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:55.789 align:start position:0%
correct that you can't be the reason for
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
that is that you're baiting behavior
 
00:56:59.859 --> 00:56:59.869 align:start position:0%
with regard to that fish is lawful under
 
00:57:01.539 --> 00:57:01.549 align:start position:0%
Title 18 and also under our
 
00:57:03.759 --> 00:57:03.769 align:start position:0%
administrative rules so therefore you
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
could not be subjected to the enhanced
 
00:57:08.049 --> 00:57:08.059 align:start position:0%
penalties in this proposed statute and
 
00:57:10.089 --> 00:57:10.099 align:start position:0%
one final question if I may follow up
 
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:12.410 align:start position:0%
mr. chair what
 
00:57:15.309 --> 00:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
well post in other words I said catch a
 
00:57:18.099 --> 00:57:18.109 align:start position:0%
fish and I quote three or four fish on
 
00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:19.490 align:start position:0%
my stringer and I told him around the
 
00:57:22.299 --> 00:57:22.309 align:start position:0%
lake is that covered under the fishing
 
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:25.190 align:start position:0%
game is a lawful way of maintaining my
 
00:57:27.339 --> 00:57:27.349 align:start position:0%
catch until I get back to shore so that
 
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:29.210 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be charged with cruelty for
 
00:57:30.819 --> 00:57:30.829 align:start position:0%
dragging the fish around the lake behind
 
00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:34.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:35.990 align:start position:0%
I believe that that would be a lawful
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
activity in from an inland fisheries
 
00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:39.890 align:start position:0%
point of view with regard to some of the
 
00:57:42.339 --> 00:57:42.349 align:start position:0%
marine species like a shark or something
 
00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:44.630 align:start position:0%
that might be something different but of
 
00:57:46.839 --> 00:57:46.849 align:start position:0%
course if you were in the marine
 
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:48.140 align:start position:0%
environment you're subject to an
 
00:57:49.749 --> 00:57:49.759 align:start position:0%
entirely different set of regulations
 
00:57:51.579 --> 00:57:51.589 align:start position:0%
but on an inland fisheries situation
 
00:57:53.769 --> 00:57:53.779 align:start position:0%
that would not be a violation very good
 
00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:56.980 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it thank you there's a rod
 
00:58:00.249 --> 00:58:00.259 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering why it's okay to get
 
00:58:02.529 --> 00:58:02.539 align:start position:0%
drunk and torture or mutilate an animal
 
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.259 --> 00:58:11.269 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you representative is
 
00:58:13.059 --> 00:58:13.069 align:start position:0%
that in our discussions with the policy
 
00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:14.900 align:start position:0%
committee they wanted the felony
 
00:58:18.249 --> 00:58:18.259 align:start position:0%
reserved for the most knowing and
 
00:58:20.859 --> 00:58:20.869 align:start position:0%
intentional types of conduct and the
 
00:58:23.079 --> 00:58:23.089 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor penalty to be reserved for
 
00:58:26.019 --> 00:58:26.029 align:start position:0%
all other types of conduct and so rather
 
00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:28.430 align:start position:0%
than lose an entire case because of
 
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:31.910 align:start position:0%
defense of intoxication I was determined
 
00:58:34.029 --> 00:58:34.039 align:start position:0%
to lower that type of conduct to a
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor not because it was something
 
00:58:38.319 --> 00:58:38.329 align:start position:0%
to encourage or excused but because we
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
did not want to lose the entire offense
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
to a defense of intoxication
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
I don't agree but I understand thank you
 
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:48.130 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:51.710 align:start position:0%
if not thank you very much thanks to

dog theft and tampering with dog's
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
collar I don't know I will just I want
 
01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:44.150 align:start position:0%
to make maybe I'm making a little
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
observations about where we are as you
 
01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:51.930 align:start position:0%
may know obviously we're scheduled to
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
have a house session on the 11th of July
 
01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:01.650 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's been recognized that
 
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:05.010 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of the house did a lot of
 
01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:07.970 align:start position:0%
work we we passed a number of bills on
 
01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:12.470 align:start position:0%
to the Senate we stayed very late on the
 
01:07:16.819 --> 01:07:16.829 align:start position:0%
until the 13th to do that that having
 
01:07:19.839 --> 01:07:19.849 align:start position:0%
been said given the constraints of the
 
01:07:24.859 --> 01:07:24.869 align:start position:0%
pandemic I think it's probably realistic
 
01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:28.050 align:start position:0%
to say that I'm not sure that the Senate
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
will give as thoughtful consideration to
 
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
the legislation that we had before this
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
committee and we did the house in the in
 
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
the near term given given the workload
 
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:44.490 align:start position:0%
that's there so as we proceed in this
 
01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:48.390 align:start position:0%
executive session I would hope that we
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
would we would be we would recommend
 
01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.329 align:start position:0%
would we would be we would recommend
here

01:07:54.329 --> 01:07:54.339 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh I you know I I just I I
 
01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:03.310 align:start position:0%
think it's fair for us to recognize that
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
that there's a high probability that the
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
if there's some concerns about any
 
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:12.890 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation and we
 
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:14.810 align:start position:0%
think we might want to leave it to the
 
01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:17.750 align:start position:0%
Senate to fix or to send it to address
 
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:19.910 align:start position:0%
when it gets there that it won't get
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
there and that's just you know III say
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
that just as a rousing the same token I
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
know our responsibility is to produce
 
01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:33.140 align:start position:0%
the best product possible for the people
 
01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:35.330 align:start position:0%
of the state of New Hampshire to craft
 
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
good public policy and I would hope that
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
as we always do with the bills that come
 
01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:43.670 align:start position:0%
before us that we would make an
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate recommendation your respect
 
01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:50.330 align:start position:0%
you know notwithstanding what we may
 
01:08:54.519 --> 01:08:54.529 align:start position:0%
think would be the reception across the
 
01:08:57.519 --> 01:08:57.529 align:start position:0%
wall I don't know if that makes any
 
01:09:00.249 --> 01:09:00.259 align:start position:0%
sense but I'm just trying to I'm trying
 
01:09:04.150 --> 01:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
to kind of set the set the stage for the
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
conversation about these six bills that
 
01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:10.940 align:start position:0%
we have before us anyways
 
01:09:14.559 --> 01:09:14.569 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if I realized that we've
 
01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:17.690 align:start position:0%
had public hearings on all of on these
 
01:09:22.269 --> 01:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
bills and usually it is but you know as
 
01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:25.130 align:start position:0%
we know during execs when we have exec
 
01:09:26.530 --> 01:09:26.540 align:start position:0%
sessions it's only members of the
 
01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:31.580 align:start position:0%
committee that could speak I always have
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
within my discretion I believe subject
 
01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:37.130 align:start position:0%
to the agreement with the rest of
 
01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:41.060 align:start position:0%
Committee the authority to ask some
 
01:09:44.289 --> 01:09:44.299 align:start position:0%
someone outside to to weigh in I may or
 
01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:47.540 align:start position:0%
may not do that now depending upon what
 
01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:49.130 align:start position:0%
the needs are they require the
 
01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:51.710 align:start position:0%
discussion but I will just open this up
 
01:09:54.249 --> 01:09:54.259 align:start position:0%
now I do not have anyone prepared to
 
01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:57.350 align:start position:0%
make a motion on House bill 1117 but I
 
01:09:59.440 --> 01:09:59.450 align:start position:0%
would open it up for conversation if
 
01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:02.450 align:start position:0%
anyone wishes to speak represent
 
01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:06.110 align:start position:0%
Bourdonnais and they're represented Roy
 
01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:09.140 align:start position:0%
mr. chairman I'm looking at the
 
01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:14.450 align:start position:0%
penalties for theft on section 637 : 11
 
01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:18.050 align:start position:0%
and it appears that the property is
 
01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:20.060 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand teen hundred dollars or
 
01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:22.870 align:start position:0%
more it's considered a Class A felony
 
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:26.210 align:start position:0%
and if there's more than a thousand
 
01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:28.310 align:start position:0%
dollars of less than $1,500 it's
 
01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:32.210 align:start position:0%
classified as a Class B felony my
 
01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
problem with the bill right now is that
 
01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:38.570 align:start position:0%
it would be better to say it would be a
 
01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:41.450 align:start position:0%
felony rather than classified as a Class
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
B felony good represent right well I
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
thought that we were going to be before
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
we opened it up for discussion we had to
 
01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
have a motion on the floors I mean
 
01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
correct with better well it's it's up to
 
01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:56.210 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the chair I don't
 
01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:58.130 align:start position:0%
haven't accepted a motion I will I
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
thought we'd have a conversation for us
 
01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:02.540 align:start position:0%
again where we're operating in a new
 
01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:05.780 align:start position:0%
environment I think that had we been
 
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:08.090 align:start position:0%
someplace else we would not have a you
 
01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:09.410 align:start position:0%
know we would have had some time in
 
01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:12.260 align:start position:0%
between to perhaps have conversations
 
01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:16.250 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves but we didn't haven't
 
01:11:17.710 --> 01:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
had that up you know we just didn't have
 
01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:21.290 align:start position:0%
that opportunity so I if you know when
 
01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:22.790 align:start position:0%
we have a conversation I will accept I
 
01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:24.350 align:start position:0%
will accept the motion but I I've
 
01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
recognized you have one to speak and I
 
01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:28.670 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Abbas because
 
01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:30.470 align:start position:0%
he raised his hand at the time and I
 
01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
don't know I'll ask for a motion okay
 
01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:38.270 align:start position:0%
well then I'll speak to the penalty with
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
regard to making this how much the
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
animal the dog is worth I think we're
 
01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:45.350 align:start position:0%
missing the mark a little bit because
 
01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly difficult to prove I
 
01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:49.310 align:start position:0%
mean what's the value of a used dog I
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
mean how do you set a value on a mean it
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
cost me so much to buy it but what's it
 
01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:56.330 align:start position:0%
worth now at seven years old I think we
 
01:11:59.410 --> 01:11:59.420 align:start position:0%
have to look at especially speaking for
 
01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
myself as a veteran the veteran
 
01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:02.810 align:start position:0%
community right now there's a lot of
 
01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:04.820 align:start position:0%
PTSD out there and a lot of people rely
 
01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:06.650 align:start position:0%
on their dogs and they might not
 
01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:08.420 align:start position:0%
necessarily be expensive trained dogs
 
01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:10.790 align:start position:0%
but they are a companion animal and to
 
01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:13.460 align:start position:0%
have that thing stolen that you rely on
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
to get through your daily life it ought
 
01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:18.890 align:start position:0%
to be a felony I think that it should be
 
01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:19.770 align:start position:0%
a felony I don't think
 
01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:21.390 align:start position:0%
need to be worrying about how much the
 
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
dog was worth how much the call is worth
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
if someone steals a dog it should be a
 
01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:32.850 align:start position:0%
felony my opinion I'm so Abbess thank
 
01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:36.390 align:start position:0%
you so I agree with what representative
 
01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
Roy said you know figuring out the exact
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
amount of you know monetary value here
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
may be difficult but just the basic to
 
01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:48.150 align:start position:0%
purchase a eight you know purebred dogs
 
01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:49.890 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred dollars and up you
 
01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:51.450 align:start position:0%
know the collar we heard is over five
 
01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:53.610 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and then whatever money
 
01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:55.230 align:start position:0%
you put into training so you know
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
perceivably you're in at a minimum you
 
01:12:59.540 --> 01:12:59.550 align:start position:0%
know four or five six thousand dollars
 
01:13:03.230 --> 01:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
already now think about the mind said
 
01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
that the individual who would steal
 
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:08.010 align:start position:0%
someone's dog it's scared just even
 
01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:09.630 align:start position:0%
think about it person commits this crime
 
01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
they know exactly what they're doing
 
01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:14.970 align:start position:0%
they apparently care less about the
 
01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
victims property interests they don't
 
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
can care less about that person's
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
emotional attachment to the animal they
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
know they're taking something that
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
belongs to someone else and they're
 
01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
taking that away and you know this is
 
01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
something that happens this happens more
 
01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:31.710 align:start position:0%
than you know people really want to talk
 
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:34.410 align:start position:0%
about and apparently it's happening more
 
01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:37.110 align:start position:0%
and the frequency is increasing you know
 
01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:39.270 align:start position:0%
to deter that conduct you know it should
 
01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:42.510 align:start position:0%
be at least a Class B felony if not it
 
01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:44.310 align:start position:0%
sounds from what representative Borden a
 
01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:47.610 align:start position:0%
suggested that you know if it's anything
 
01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:49.470 align:start position:0%
else it would actually be a Class A so
 
01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:51.810 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's even a light penalty
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
as a Class B felony but at the very
 
01:13:58.150 --> 01:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
minimum it should be a Class B felony I
 
01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
resent rice Thank You mr. chairman I
 
01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:04.110 align:start position:0%
would just like to state that my rescue
 
01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:05.660 align:start position:0%
dog is priceless to me
 
01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:09.390 align:start position:0%
so there should not be a price on it
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
the value she brings to our family in
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
our home you can't put a dollar sign in
 
01:14:17.029 --> 01:14:17.039 align:start position:0%
front of
 
01:14:19.819 --> 01:14:19.829 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other any other
 
01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:26.570 align:start position:0%
comments all right
 
01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:32.890 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
we represent
 
01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:40.110 align:start position:0%
honey I think you miss Cheerilee I'm not
 
01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:44.790 align:start position:0%
sure whether you are acceptable to have
 
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
them a amendment to this bill but if we
 
01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:52.230 align:start position:0%
could I would like to amend it to make
 
01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:55.590 align:start position:0%
it a felony without a class on it
 
01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
therefore value of the property can be
 
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:04.580 align:start position:0%
taken in consideration otherwise if you
 
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
someone steals a a dog worth $2,500 with
 
01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:15.630 align:start position:0%
a collar worth $1,500 actually you
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
better off just looking at stolen
 
01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:19.470 align:start position:0%
property because that would be a Class A
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
felony so the best solution is to get
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
rid of the designation of a felony a B
 
01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:31.700 align:start position:0%
Class felony and just make that a felony
 
01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:35.910 align:start position:0%
well I I appreciate that I will say that
 
01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:39.930 align:start position:0%
I you know I'm unfortunately under the
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
current framework to her operating we we
 
01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:46.350 align:start position:0%
do not have the opportunity to make an
 
01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
amendment right now the process I lie
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
that I outlined earlier that was you
 
01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:55.830 align:start position:0%
know given it was explained made public
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
is that in this instance as we're
 
01:15:59.960 --> 01:15:59.970 align:start position:0%
operating in order to provide public
 
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:03.510 align:start position:0%
notice to everybody we are required to
 
01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:05.070 align:start position:0%
have any amendment that we will
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
considered submitted to OLS 72 hours
 
01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
before and and 24 hours have it posted
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
up on the website so that not just this
 
01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:17.850 align:start position:0%
committee but other members of the
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
public have the opportunity to do it
 
01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:22.530 align:start position:0%
it's a way that they try to operate on
 
01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:25.350 align:start position:0%
under this situation so right now the
 
01:16:28.670 --> 01:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
that would not be an option so I mean
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the options that we have
 
01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:34.790 align:start position:0%
before us now since there has been no
 
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
amendment submitted before this
 
01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
executive session would be to pass the
 
01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
bill you know our to pass interim study
 
01:16:49.879 --> 01:16:49.889 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:52.030 align:start position:0%
that's the situation we find ourselves
 
01:16:54.779 --> 01:16:54.789 align:start position:0%
in representative rod has her hand up
 
01:16:56.729 --> 01:16:56.739 align:start position:0%
and then represent testerman and then
 
01:16:58.290 --> 01:16:58.300 align:start position:0%
representative happens I'd like to make
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion of to pass
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
represent rod makes a post about to pass
 
01:17:09.689 --> 01:17:09.699 align:start position:0%
to our representative op de Becque I saw
 
01:17:13.049 --> 01:17:13.059 align:start position:0%
waved in the screen recognize
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
representative op de Becque I second
 
01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:18.460 align:start position:0%
second it okay
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
so motion about to pass has been made
 
01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:23.170 align:start position:0%
and seconded is there any further
 
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none of us has a hand
 
01:17:32.419 --> 01:17:32.429 align:start position:0%
up I'll represent of Abbess I'm sorry
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I just to compare this to a
 
01:17:37.799 --> 01:17:37.809 align:start position:0%
bill that I filed and I know some of us
 
01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:41.260 align:start position:0%
had some fun with HB 11:23 that was my
 
01:17:45.089 --> 01:17:45.099 align:start position:0%
cat bill and you know my experience with
 
01:17:47.899 --> 01:17:47.909 align:start position:0%
that bill is that despite that being
 
01:17:52.739 --> 01:17:52.749 align:start position:0%
property in law enforcement didn't
 
01:17:56.129 --> 01:17:56.139 align:start position:0%
always apply your typical property
 
01:17:57.899 --> 01:17:57.909 align:start position:0%
rights or property destruction of
 
01:18:01.859 --> 01:18:01.869 align:start position:0%
property to animals so I think it's
 
01:18:03.419 --> 01:18:03.429 align:start position:0%
although I agree with representative
 
01:18:06.089 --> 01:18:06.099 align:start position:0%
Bourdonnais that it should fall under
 
01:18:07.439 --> 01:18:07.449 align:start position:0%
there and I thought it should fall in
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
there as is that's just not how the law
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
was being applied you know to disagree
 
01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:14.380 align:start position:0%
NIT myself in law enforcement
 
01:18:16.109 --> 01:18:16.119 align:start position:0%
disagreement that's why I filed said
 
01:18:17.939 --> 01:18:17.949 align:start position:0%
that other bill so I think with this one
 
01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:20.860 align:start position:0%
you know just be mindful that that it
 
01:18:22.649 --> 01:18:22.659 align:start position:0%
may not be enforced the way we wanted to
 
01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:24.460 align:start position:0%
so I think being specific with the type
 
01:18:26.759 --> 01:18:26.769 align:start position:0%
of felony may be better and you know
 
01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:28.420 align:start position:0%
maybe we consider whether it should be
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
an A or B okay as someone else seeing Oh
 
01:18:38.009 --> 01:18:38.019 align:start position:0%
hands up is that correct Pam that's
 
01:18:39.689 --> 01:18:39.699 align:start position:0%
correct except for out in the audience
 
01:18:43.229 --> 01:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
I'm Jennifer Smith well we're gonna I
 
01:18:45.419 --> 01:18:45.429 align:start position:0%
think we're ready for the vote I can
 
01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
think we're ready for the vote I can
tell

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:46.690 align:start position:0%
tell
 
01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:49.510 align:start position:0%
representative Linda Harriet gasps right

for mid for the reason for doing the
 
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
majority report then having made the

motion all right thank you we'll move on
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
we'll take up a House bill 1580 an act
 
01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
regulating the use of unmanned aircraft
 
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:42.810 align:start position:0%
systems and I'm you know is in the
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
patent I again we had not heard this I I
 
01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:48.020 align:start position:0%
will open it up for discussion and then
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
then I'll take a motion but is there
 
01:21:51.859 --> 01:21:51.869 align:start position:0%
anyone that wishes to speak on House
 
01:21:54.729 --> 01:21:54.739 align:start position:0%
bill 1580 represent boy tonight
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
making sure I understand what the
 
01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:01.110 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill was but I think
 
01:22:04.399 --> 01:22:04.409 align:start position:0%
it's so broadly written that I have to
 
01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
really be against it I understand the
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
nuisances of
 
01:22:16.129 --> 01:22:16.139 align:start position:0%
a drum dating your property is is really
 
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
a nuisance but I think that this
 
01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:25.850 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:28.770 align:start position:0%
if we had a commercial aircraft for
 
01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:33.150 align:start position:0%
example they could do things that this
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
drone would be ridden to do so I'm not
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:43.170 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:46.950 align:start position:0%
I don't bother Cyril has a hand up sorry
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
for the call time
 
01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:49.890 align:start position:0%
thank you I miss Jim and I think this
 
01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:51.870 align:start position:0%
bill here it does it a couple of things
 
01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:53.910 align:start position:0%
here protects the privacy of the
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
individuals on their property I mean I'm
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
sitting here here's a small little drone
 
01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:02.550 align:start position:0%
that my wife uses she's a GIS person I
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
think we need something law that
 
01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
protects homeowners you know but at the
 
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
same time gives the GIS and others the
 
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
you know to be able to police to be able
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
to use them so it's a win-win on the
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
privacy part so I have to support it any
 
01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:26.310 align:start position:0%
further discussion Julie I think
 
01:23:28.729 --> 01:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
represent radhakrishnan is talking but I
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't see represent Radhakrishna router
 
01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:38.610 align:start position:0%
Stan you're not we you
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
you're not unmuted yeah I would like to
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
know if I a minor you know gets a
 
01:23:49.459 --> 01:23:49.469 align:start position:0%
birthday present a drone and he's using
 
01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:51.690 align:start position:0%
it for recreational purposes and he's
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
under the he's a minor under the age of
 
01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:57.330 align:start position:0%
say 15 would the penalty be the same for
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
invasion of privacy a person I would
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
just say a person who is a minor would
 
01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:07.710 align:start position:0%
not be that would be a juvenile justice
 
01:24:14.479 --> 01:24:14.489 align:start position:0%
matter okay represented O'Hearn has his
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%

01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
me yes I again I just want to bring up
 
01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:27.090 align:start position:0%
that all the discussion except for this
 
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
last one is not talking about the
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
penalties and that's what we're supposed
 
01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:33.210 align:start position:0%
to be discussing is this adequate or not
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
for the bill that was sent to us second
 
01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
for the bill that was sent to us second

how are you allowed to participate
 
01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:08.810 align:start position:0%
you're the fact that you're whether
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor or not is irrelevant the only
 
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
time that we make we take that has an
 
01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
impact upon our work is when we have a
 
01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
public hearing we ask if you're a

as opposed to sitting and asking
 
01:29:30.710 --> 01:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
questions to avoid the appearance that
 
01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:34.590 align:start position:0%
it's that the the public hearing would
 
01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:37.230 align:start position:0%
not be fair to all participants but and
 
01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:38.970 align:start position:0%
in your capacity as
 
01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:40.620 align:start position:0%

possession of tobacco products this is
 
01:37:23.610 --> 01:37:23.620 align:start position:0%
where we were going to do something so I
 
01:37:27.970 --> 01:37:27.980 align:start position:0%
House bill 60 and 62 as some of you may
 
01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:29.870 align:start position:0%
remember this bill came to us from the
 
01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:35.090 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee and it at the time at
 
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:40.190 align:start position:0%
there was brought to us an amendment
 
01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:42.370 align:start position:0%
that was agreed upon by a number of
 
01:37:46.959 --> 01:37:46.969 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that represented CLE the
 
01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:50.630 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill had subsequent
 
01:37:54.570 --> 01:37:54.580 align:start position:0%
to that had put into a formal draft form
 
01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:58.150 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons it was done is to
 
01:38:01.209 --> 01:38:01.219 align:start position:0%
reconcile some differences that existed
 
01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:03.050 align:start position:0%
between the federal policy and the state
 
01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:09.830 align:start position:0%
policy and prior to our as we're
 
01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:13.790 align:start position:0%
preparing to come in to exact session to
 
01:38:16.150 --> 01:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
take up the bill I had raised the
 
01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:19.670 align:start position:0%
question about whether the amendment
 
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
that was submitted to the committee
 
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:23.020 align:start position:0%
originally there was
 
01:38:26.130 --> 01:38:26.140 align:start position:0%
by representative Klee would be
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient for us to act upon and I was
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
informed that in fact again in the
 
01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:36.850 align:start position:0%
current rules that any amendments that
 
01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:38.410 align:start position:0%
we would take up an executive session
 
01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:41.470 align:start position:0%
had to be requested it had to be drawn
 
01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:43.780 align:start position:0%
up on the name of a member of the
 
01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:46.180 align:start position:0%
committee so what I did is I had
 
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:48.730 align:start position:0%
representative Cleese bill put under my
 
01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:54.820 align:start position:0%
name and that is amendment one two four
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
eight of 2020 and that amendment has
 
01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:04.390 align:start position:0%
been on the Statehouse website to give
 
01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:07.690 align:start position:0%
full notice to people I've also had
 
01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:10.810 align:start position:0%
conversations with the chair of the
 
01:39:13.110 --> 01:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee who supports this
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
amendment with the sponsor of the bill
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
and with the director of enforcement for
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission which has
 
01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over these tobacco products
 
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:28.210 align:start position:0%
and for purposes of moving this forward
 
01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:29.530 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a couple step
 
01:39:33.930 --> 01:39:33.940 align:start position:0%
process but I'm going to move my move
 
01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:38.740 align:start position:0%
amendment one two four eight a move to
 
01:39:42.990 --> 01:39:43.000 align:start position:0%

and I will recognize representative rod
 
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:52.240 align:start position:0%

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:54.970 align:start position:0%

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:01.510 align:start position:0%

01:41:46.150 --> 01:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
or you know is that's against federal
 
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
law I mean the logic of that I mean
 
01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:49.430 align:start position:0%
forget about your what your position is
 
01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:51.620 align:start position:0%
on cannabis I'm not going down that road
 
01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:53.330 align:start position:0%
right now I'm just saying that the logic
 
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
behind that's not consistent and you
 
01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:57.470 align:start position:0%
can't say well we want to pass this and
 
01:41:59.440 --> 01:41:59.450 align:start position:0%
raise the the backhoe age to 21 because
 
01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:01.790 align:start position:0%
the federal law says so but then at the
 
01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
same time whit's add cannabis to it when
 
01:42:08.050 --> 01:42:08.060 align:start position:0%
that contradicts federal law I mean we I
 
01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:09.590 align:start position:0%
think to me those are separate and we
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
should keep him separate and like I said
 
01:42:13.630 --> 01:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
the logic doesn't line up so I couldn't
 
01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:18.350 align:start position:0%
I can't support the amendment i I am
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
looking to see if representative CLE or
 
01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:26.860 align:start position:0%
someone is present as an attendee that
 
01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:30.230 align:start position:0%
might want to speak more specifically I
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
will simply say that I have put in my
 
01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:36.410 align:start position:0%
name and I'm taking it up because that's
 
01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:38.450 align:start position:0%
the MEK that's that's the the process
 
01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:42.110 align:start position:0%
that we're operating under if you see a
 
01:42:44.650 --> 01:42:44.660 align:start position:0%
handout in the attendee list but it's a
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
phone number and I can't
 
01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:50.030 align:start position:0%
by the name of the person okay you want
 
01:42:53.229 --> 01:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
me to try that or I will oh I found out
 
01:42:55.689 --> 01:42:55.699 align:start position:0%
I can tell I can look at the attendee
 
01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:00.770 align:start position:0%
list so now there are two hands out in
 
01:43:04.330 --> 01:43:04.340 align:start position:0%
the attendees better oh okay I don't
 
01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:11.270 align:start position:0%
recognize I can't see them on who can
 
01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:13.670 align:start position:0%
you identify someone it's very difficult
 
01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:15.230 align:start position:0%
when someone doesn't have their they're
 
01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:16.790 align:start position:0%
not identified I'm not gonna call on
 
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
them if they're I will unless I hear
 
01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:24.530 align:start position:0%
from somebody from either the agents if
 
01:43:25.959 --> 01:43:25.969 align:start position:0%
they're somebody from the from the
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
agency is there anybody is Mark I mean
 
01:43:31.209 --> 01:43:31.219 align:start position:0%
somebody Abigail Rogers I believe is
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:40.250 align:start position:0%
Services I don't know who yeah Abigail
 
01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:43.420 align:start position:0%
Rogers has her hand up no more from the
 
01:43:45.939 --> 01:43:45.949 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission okay we'll have
 
01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:47.510 align:start position:0%
someone from the liquor commissioner and
 
01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:55.730 align:start position:0%
someone from the HHS okay any more from
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission fine please good
 
01:44:02.130 --> 01:44:02.140 align:start position:0%
day sir I have committee members that
 
01:44:04.330 --> 01:44:04.340 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to try to answer any of
 
01:44:07.770 --> 01:44:07.780 align:start position:0%
your questions I I am NOT able to locate
 
01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:15.590 align:start position:0%
amendment one two four eight I do have a
 
01:44:23.130 --> 01:44:23.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.810 --> 01:44:28.820 align:start position:0%
numbered one one nine six but is that
 
01:44:30.939 --> 01:44:30.949 align:start position:0%
represented with cleese name on it yes
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
it does then the language in one two
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
four eight is exactly the same as the
 
01:44:38.169 --> 01:44:38.179 align:start position:0%
language that you have been represented
 
01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:41.690 align:start position:0%
please okay thank you sir I guess I
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
would I would I know there's been some
 
01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:48.770 align:start position:0%
policy questions about the impact but
 
01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:51.050 align:start position:0%
the amendment as introduced would allow
 
01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:55.250 align:start position:0%
us to enforce the federal provisions at
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
the state level and have consistency in
 
01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:00.170 align:start position:0%
the age which is up to this point
 
01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:04.490 align:start position:0%
time has been has been a challenge so
 
01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:05.630 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try to answer any
 
01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:07.130 align:start position:0%
questions that committee members might
 
01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:11.660 align:start position:0%
have about the amendment and its ability
 
01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:16.610 align:start position:0%
to be enforced to any members the
 
01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:17.870 align:start position:0%
committee have it specific question
 
01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:21.650 align:start position:0%
right yes thank you thank you for taking
 
01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:22.550 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if is this law
 
01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:29.180 align:start position:0%
necessary or is it not move based on the
 
01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:31.190 align:start position:0%
the current federal I mean why do we
 
01:45:32.710 --> 01:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
even need this if it's federally illegal
 
01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:36.340 align:start position:0%
it's illegal is it not well I
 
01:45:40.810 --> 01:45:40.820 align:start position:0%
respectfully the the way this works is
 
01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:42.650 align:start position:0%
that there's a couple of it operates at
 
01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:44.570 align:start position:0%
a couple of different levels first of
 
01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:48.170 align:start position:0%
all the state enforces the laws using
 
01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement officers enforce
 
01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:55.270 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire provisions and under 126 K
 
01:45:59.920 --> 01:45:59.930 align:start position:0%
we have an age of 19 the federal
 
01:46:04.830 --> 01:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
provisions have moved to age 21 and
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
there is no mechanism for whether it's
 
01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:11.990 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement or any police officer
 
01:46:14.110 --> 01:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to enforce federal
 
01:46:16.530 --> 01:46:16.540 align:start position:0%
provisions unless they have been
 
01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:19.030 align:start position:0%
commissioned with that type of authority
 
01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:23.270 align:start position:0%
so this bill would increase a state age
 
01:46:27.850 --> 01:46:27.860 align:start position:0%
to 21 and now provide New Hampshire law
 
01:46:34.150 --> 01:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement with a clear and comparable
 
01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:36.950 align:start position:0%
federal provision to allow for the
 
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement of those laws so we can't we
 
01:46:44.890 --> 01:46:44.900 align:start position:0%
can't enforce the federal law as a state
 
01:46:49.210 --> 01:46:49.220 align:start position:0%
of state officer right and I would just
 
01:46:51.490 --> 01:46:51.500 align:start position:0%
again I want to make the observation
 
01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
that while we normally do not have
 
01:46:58.810 --> 01:46:58.820 align:start position:0%
members of the public or anyone else but
 
01:47:02.110 --> 01:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
members speak during an exact session
 
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'm making an exception to have provided
 
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
information in this instance and so a be
 
01:47:13.870 --> 01:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
miss Rogers
 
01:47:16.689 --> 01:47:16.699 align:start position:0%
has a follow-up question sorry right
 
01:47:18.970 --> 01:47:18.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah thank you just real quick
 
01:47:21.459 --> 01:47:21.469 align:start position:0%
I just want to do a lot of it I just
 
01:47:23.050 --> 01:47:23.060 align:start position:0%
want to do a quick listening check so
 
01:47:25.209 --> 01:47:25.219 align:start position:0%
and my understanding what you said is
 
01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:28.730 align:start position:0%
it's currently federally illegal to sell
 
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:31.010 align:start position:0%
tobacco products at a convenience store
 
01:47:33.879 --> 01:47:33.889 align:start position:0%
to someone under the age of 21 but the
 
01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
alcohol Tobacco Liquor Commission can't
 
01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:39.050 align:start position:0%
enforce that if a store does it because
 
01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:41.030 align:start position:0%
the state statute doesn't mirror the
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
federal one is that what I'm hearing
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
well partially correct if I'm going to
 
01:47:48.850 --> 01:47:48.860 align:start position:0%
try to make this it's a little more
 
01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:49.850 align:start position:0%
complicated than that
 
01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:52.070 align:start position:0%
but I'll try to clarify it and I
 
01:47:56.410 --> 01:47:56.420 align:start position:0%
apologize for any confusion the Liquor
 
01:48:01.149 --> 01:48:01.159 align:start position:0%
Commission is the enforcement arm for
 
01:48:04.689 --> 01:48:04.699 align:start position:0%
federal provisions dealing with the sale
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
of tobacco so for example the Liquor
 
01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:11.770 align:start position:0%
Commission will profile perform
 
01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:14.810 align:start position:0%
al-khattab echo compliance checks with
 
01:48:18.490 --> 01:48:18.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire licensees for the purposes
 
01:48:20.979 --> 01:48:20.989 align:start position:0%
of compliance with the federal tobacco
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
laws so when they go out and do that
 
01:48:26.979 --> 01:48:26.989 align:start position:0%
they're doing that under the federal
 
01:48:28.570 --> 01:48:28.580 align:start position:0%
authority that they have with an
 
01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:30.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate Commission and there are
 
01:48:36.669 --> 01:48:36.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines by which those failures are
 
01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:39.650 align:start position:0%
reported to the FDA for administrative
 
01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:43.420 align:start position:0%
action at the federal level if a
 
01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:46.370 align:start position:0%
compliance check work to be conducted
 
01:48:50.919 --> 01:48:50.929 align:start position:0%
that was strictly state-based or there
 
01:48:53.110 --> 01:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
was a an enforcement officer who
 
01:48:55.419 --> 01:48:55.429 align:start position:0%
happened to go by a store and see a
 
01:48:57.459 --> 01:48:57.469 align:start position:0%
young person coming out with tobacco
 
01:48:59.919 --> 01:48:59.929 align:start position:0%
products and challenged them found out
 
01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:03.980 align:start position:0%
that they were age 18 say for example
 
01:49:08.379 --> 01:49:08.389 align:start position:0%
then they're moving forward would be on
 
01:49:11.290 --> 01:49:11.300 align:start position:0%
a state level because they're acting in
 
01:49:15.610 --> 01:49:15.620 align:start position:0%
a state capacity versus the federal
 
01:49:17.530 --> 01:49:17.540 align:start position:0%
authority that they have when they're
 
01:49:20.979 --> 01:49:20.989 align:start position:0%
conducting a dedicated federal check now
 
01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:22.790 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I've clarified that and
 
01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:25.130 align:start position:0%
I apologize if I've added any confusion
 
01:49:27.169 --> 01:49:27.179 align:start position:0%
but out
 
01:49:29.319 --> 01:49:29.329 align:start position:0%
there are essentially two different
 
01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:32.309 align:start position:0%
paths that this could follow the the
 
01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:35.130 align:start position:0%
federal path which of course is 21 and
 
01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
then a purely state path which relies on
 
01:49:42.799 --> 01:49:42.809 align:start position:0%
state law solely which is now in age 19
 
01:49:45.979 --> 01:49:45.989 align:start position:0%
and this bill and this amendment would
 
01:49:49.459 --> 01:49:49.469 align:start position:0%
raise the age to 21 thereby providing
 
01:49:51.739 --> 01:49:51.749 align:start position:0%
uniformity at the state and federal
 
01:49:55.759 --> 01:49:55.769 align:start position:0%
level represent baldesarra
 
01:49:59.719 --> 01:49:59.729 align:start position:0%
I just want to just clarify something on
 
01:50:01.819 --> 01:50:01.829 align:start position:0%
this amendment am I getting this right
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
you can smoke cigarettes
 
01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:07.170 align:start position:0%
you can't smoke cigarettes under 21 well
 
01:50:08.479 --> 01:50:08.489 align:start position:0%
with this amendment you'll be able to
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
smoke marijuana under 21 with a medical
 
01:50:15.979 --> 01:50:15.989 align:start position:0%
card does this mirror federal law well
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's what New Hampshire lawyers
 
01:50:19.609 --> 01:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana I'm not a hundred
 
01:50:23.919 --> 01:50:23.929 align:start position:0%
percent certain of the criteria but that
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
provision was put in there to give
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been prescribed
 
01:50:37.850 --> 01:50:37.860 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana as a treatment the

I have a question if the senior town
 
01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
wants to put forward a the city
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
ordinance that raised it to 21 or
 
01:51:57.230 --> 01:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
whatever does this affect their ability
 
01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:00.810 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:04.530 align:start position:0%
no in some cases there are communities
 
01:52:06.170 --> 01:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who have already
 
01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
byah the ordinance process increase the
 
01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:14.730 align:start position:0%
age to possess tobacco to 21 so this if
 
01:52:17.150 --> 01:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
this were to become statute or a law in
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it would bring all
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
communities up to that state provision
 
01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:28.890 align:start position:0%
of age 21 to possess tobacco products

01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
the oversight Donna tobacco prevention
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
and cessation programs um if the
 
01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:30.650 align:start position:0%
committee has any specific questions
 
01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:33.630 align:start position:0%
they can raise but one of the important
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
thing is to understand that this would
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
actually align with our this would
 
01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:42.150 align:start position:0%
mirror the federal t21 legislation that
 
01:53:44.230 --> 01:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
has been already passed in December and
 
01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:46.890 align:start position:0%
we are very comfortable with the
 
01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:48.750 align:start position:0%
legislation because that matters that
 
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
our federal legislation and for us the
 
01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:53.370 align:start position:0%
most important piece is increasing this
 
01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:54.630 align:start position:0%
age to 21
 
01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:56.730 align:start position:0%
actually help to save a lot of lives
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
young lives because has we are looking
 
01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:03.270 align:start position:0%
at some of our data on youth tobacco
 
01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:06.750 align:start position:0%
tobacco there is increasing number of
 
01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:11.610 align:start position:0%
people who are using in 2017 like you
 
01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:12.870 align:start position:0%
know the number of kids who are
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
increasing their use of tobacco for the
 
01:54:18.169 --> 01:54:18.179 align:start position:0%
high school it's almost around quarter
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
of 25 percent of our high school
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
students use the tobacco the strictly
 
01:54:25.250 --> 01:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
the waves or electronic waves so this
 
01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:26.790 align:start position:0%
actually defines some of that language
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
and it looks at some of that and helps
 
01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:31.770 align:start position:0%
to reduce that e-cigarette use in that
 
01:54:35.209 --> 01:54:35.219 align:start position:0%
in that population and also it out it
 
01:54:37.939 --> 01:54:37.949 align:start position:0%
also aligns with with a lot of our
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about what we understand
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
current information has the best
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
evidences not of smokers they start by
 
01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:49.230 align:start position:0%
age of 18 by increasing this age to 21
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
that actually helps us to decrease that
 
01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:55.050 align:start position:0%
and in long term it improves our health
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
care cost it's almost in New Hampshire
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
if you look at the cost of smoking cost
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
health here it's around seven hundred
 
01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:03.030 align:start position:0%
and twenty nine million dollars per year
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
so you're looking at the really cost
 
01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:09.570 align:start position:0%
savings in in long term I thank you I
 
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:11.250 align:start position:0%
don't there's any questions I do note
 
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
that representative CLE just sent me a
 
01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
text saying she's on the phone I don't
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
know if you can find that if she has
 
01:55:17.899 --> 01:55:17.909 align:start position:0%
anything that she wants to throw in yes
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
yes we identified her phone number as
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
the phone er that had raised their hand
 
01:55:25.399 --> 01:55:25.409 align:start position:0%
earlier but we didn't realize who it was
 
01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:27.210 align:start position:0%
at first but now and you see it's her
 
01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:31.230 align:start position:0%
and you know she's unmuted and able to
 
01:55:34.879 --> 01:55:34.889 align:start position:0%
speak clearly everything was yeah can
 
01:55:37.610 --> 01:55:37.620 align:start position:0%
you hear me yes okay thank you
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
yes this bill as it's been stated is
 
01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:46.050 align:start position:0%
primarily the bill itself is primarily
 
01:55:48.379 --> 01:55:48.389 align:start position:0%
to put us in line with the federal the
 
01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:51.810 align:start position:0%
amendment was made per request of DHHS
 
01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:54.210 align:start position:0%
as they have just stated there and that
 
01:55:57.919 --> 01:55:57.929 align:start position:0%
was to to do some housekeeping is I
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
think it was where the way it was put to
 
01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:02.610 align:start position:0%
me to keep everything in line with what
 
01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:04.530 align:start position:0%
we have to make all the statutes that we
 
01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:07.530 align:start position:0%
have kind of equal and in other words
 
01:56:08.610 --> 01:56:08.620 align:start position:0%
there were certain
 
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:12.010 align:start position:0%
items that they'd said one thing and it
 
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
was he carried into other items so
 
01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:15.190 align:start position:0%
that's basically what this amendment
 
01:56:17.790 --> 01:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
does is house we think the main bill is
 
01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:19.750 align:start position:0%
to keep us in line with what the federal
 
01:56:22.590 --> 01:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
has put through to help enforcement as
 
01:56:25.170 --> 01:56:25.180 align:start position:0%
well as to help the retailer's you know
 
01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:26.470 align:start position:0%
they've got two sets of standards
 
01:56:28.710 --> 01:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
they've got a federal twenty one and
 
01:56:31.530 --> 01:56:31.540 align:start position:0%
they've got a state nineteen and it's
 
01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:34.030 align:start position:0%
not meant to penalize and and in answer
 
01:56:36.690 --> 01:56:36.700 align:start position:0%
to questions of well one state has this
 
01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:38.470 align:start position:0%
and one state has another techno speak
 
01:56:40.590 --> 01:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
in the federal government has tobacco 21
 
01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:43.810 align:start position:0%
I am Not sure that I quite shall come to
 
01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:45.790 align:start position:0%
all addressing the the rolling paper
 
01:56:47.670 --> 01:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
issue which is kind of what the
 
01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:49.990 align:start position:0%
housekeeping was but I just wanted to
 
01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:53.050 align:start position:0%
make what the bill was primarily for so
 
01:56:55.050 --> 01:56:55.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
01:56:58.590 --> 01:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
comment thank you any discussion I guess
 
01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:01.090 align:start position:0%
I see you know what we will move first
 
01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:06.390 align:start position:0%
to the amendment the clerk is ready
 
01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:24.580 align:start position:0%
clerk ready sorry if you're if you're in
 
01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:32.010 align:start position:0%
favor amendment 1 to 4 H to House bill
 
01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:35.050 align:start position:0%
1660 - you'll say yay if you're opposed
 
01:57:40.590 --> 01:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
you'll say nay mr. chairman yes if
 
01:57:43.170 --> 01:57:43.180 align:start position:0%
people look on the screen at least on my
 
01:57:45.930 --> 01:57:45.940 align:start position:0%
screen I'm using a surface pro you can
 
01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:48.430 align:start position:0%
see a little red symbol in the lower
 
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:51.010 align:start position:0%
left of the pictures if it's there you
 
01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:55.390 align:start position:0%
need to unmute yourself as I muted no
 
01:57:58.590 --> 01:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
but people are and I think that's why
 
01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:00.070 align:start position:0%
the clerk is having a little bit of
 
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:02.890 align:start position:0%
trouble Pam cannot unmute them as she
 
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
said right and I know that we have we've
 
01:58:08.010 --> 01:58:08.020 align:start position:0%
been through some trainings it seems
 
01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:10.210 align:start position:0%
like every depending on what your
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
platform depending whether you're a
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
computer whether it's a PC whether it's
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
a mac whether it's an iPad whether it's
 
01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:18.250 align:start position:0%
an iPhone it seems that they all have a
 
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
little different I think that's what's
 
01:58:22.169 --> 01:58:22.179 align:start position:0%
happening with
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
the four representatives you know
 
01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:25.570 align:start position:0%
represent Penta locos I know she you
 
01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:27.730 align:start position:0%
know she said she's not remute iner self
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
but somehow she still needs to you know
 
01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:32.710 align:start position:0%
press her mute barge and get in it must
 
01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:35.230 align:start position:0%
be a device issue with representatives
 
01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:41.710 align:start position:0%
Welsh why why don't we why don't we
 
01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:45.690 align:start position:0%
proceed with the role and then we can
 
01:58:47.729 --> 01:58:47.739 align:start position:0%
back in before we do anything else about
 
01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:50.230 align:start position:0%
the mechanical problems we're having
 
01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:53.110 align:start position:0%
right now represent us have his hand up
 
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
I don't you want to have more to say I
 
01:58:59.399 --> 01:58:59.409 align:start position:0%
don't know let me say about her I just
 
01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:03.610 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify I get muted and then I
 
01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:06.190 align:start position:0%
cannot unmute myself and because it says
 
01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:09.190 align:start position:0%
that the host will not allow me to
 
01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:12.370 align:start position:0%
unmute so when you call on me some
 
01:59:14.939 --> 01:59:14.949 align:start position:0%
reason that finally shows up that the
 
01:59:17.370 --> 01:59:17.380 align:start position:0%
host will is allowing me I'm you so I'm
 
01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:18.850 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly what I'm doing wrong
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
but I really haven't touched it I didn't
 
01:59:24.450 --> 01:59:24.460 align:start position:0%
try not mute myself let's let's when we
 
01:59:26.130 --> 01:59:26.140 align:start position:0%
let's get to the roll call and then
 
01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:28.150 align:start position:0%
we'll then we can take a pause and we
 
01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:29.770 align:start position:0%
can have a discussion about muting and
 
01:59:31.709 --> 01:59:31.719 align:start position:0%
unmuting in those questions that's all
 
01:59:43.130 --> 01:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.899 --> 01:59:45.909 align:start position:0%
again she I could suite her lips and she
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
said yes I don't know if it's I said yes
 
01:59:57.660 --> 01:59:57.670 align:start position:0%
yes Ohan yes Harriet Garth right
 
02:00:01.050 --> 02:00:01.060 align:start position:0%
no up the back yes
 
02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
Borden egg yeah news yes
 
02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:10.690 align:start position:0%
Murphy yes new men yes man it's just
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:34.330 align:start position:0%

what no no rice no baltasar no testimon
yes

02:00:51.590 --> 02:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.209 --> 02:01:09.219 align:start position:0%
Wallace no Avice no Roy no over no and
 
02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:26.650 align:start position:0%
Cushing yes before I I wanted just to
 
02:01:30.510 --> 02:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
revisit the questions of technical
 
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
different difficulties is there anybody
 
02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:34.090 align:start position:0%
that's one that has anything they need
 
02:01:36.630 --> 02:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
to share with us or questions in the
 
02:01:38.459 --> 02:01:38.469 align:start position:0%
middle of this before we move on to the
 
02:01:41.310 --> 02:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
voting on the on the bill itself
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
represent panel aqus yes I just want to
 
02:01:47.970 --> 02:01:47.980 align:start position:0%
say that mine comes up for media unmuted
 
02:01:53.939 --> 02:01:53.949 align:start position:0%
the host is muted okay all right we're
 
02:01:53.949 --> 02:01:58.130 align:start position:0%
the host is muted okay all right we're
learning

02:01:58.130 --> 02:01:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:05.670 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna comment I think maybe I'd
 
02:02:08.630 --> 02:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
be useful if you unmuted everyone and
 
02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:12.450 align:start position:0%
then see if some people stay muted and
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
you can't do it as the HOS well we've
 
02:02:19.490 --> 02:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
been onion I do at the outset of the
 
02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:22.050 align:start position:0%
roll call I unmute everyone with the
 
02:02:28.090 --> 02:02:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:32.250 align:start position:0%
unutilized they so most of you you know
 
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
the board clears and you're all unmuted
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the for every roll call but for some
 
02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:40.590 align:start position:0%
reason those four aren't following along
 
02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:43.710 align:start position:0%
and I'm not treating anybody differently
 
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:47.310 align:start position:0%
and I'm treating no I only I only say
 
02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
that because I got caught up in in that
 
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
a little bit when I when you muted it
 
02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:56.430 align:start position:0%
and then I muted myself or something and
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
it just stayed muted but anyway
 
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and I'm not sure I I
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
certainly don't know the solution you
 
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:08.010 align:start position:0%
know we seem to be muddling through and
 
02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:10.290 align:start position:0%
I apologize but we'll we'll definitely
 
02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:15.990 align:start position:0%
investigate this now oh my god I was
 
02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:20.190 align:start position:0%
muted you were muted so I was muted
 
02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:21.270 align:start position:0%
because I was trying to tell you that I
 
02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:23.450 align:start position:0%
think memory center rice is trying to uh
 
02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
yeah yes she's unfitted oh thanks so I'm
 
02:03:30.650 --> 02:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
just wondering if those are they're
 
02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:33.450 align:start position:0%
staying muted if they're only unmuting
 
02:03:35.690 --> 02:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
using the space bar because that
 
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
automatically puts your mute back on
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
when you're done speaking they have to
 
02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:43.530 align:start position:0%
literally unmute and just leave it alone
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
not hitting the space bar does that make
 
02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:53.730 align:start position:0%
sense to me I don't it I don't know how
 
02:03:56.450 --> 02:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
they're I'm you know they're using their
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
space bars represent well I just didn't
 
02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
even know I could do that I'd ever heard
 
02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:13.730 align:start position:0%
in you have you heared up then
 
02:04:18.370 --> 02:04:18.380 align:start position:0%
again there we go so again when I
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
whoever is a host its muting and
 
02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:24.510 align:start position:0%
unmuting I get a prophet says his asking
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
me to unmute and every time so until you
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
send me a response somebody's I can't
 
02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:36.630 align:start position:0%
unmute now I don't I thought we weren't
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to be able to be able to touch
 
02:04:39.919 --> 02:04:39.929 align:start position:0%
anything and I just sit here and you
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
know every time like after we're talking
 
02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:48.570 align:start position:0%
you'll it'll say host has muted you but
 
02:04:51.439 --> 02:04:51.449 align:start position:0%
when it's prompting to unmute got the
 
02:04:53.029 --> 02:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
way for you to send me a single and I
 
02:04:54.819 --> 02:04:54.829 align:start position:0%
have to confirm it
 
02:04:58.060 --> 02:04:58.070 align:start position:0%
yes you know what we are doing we are
 
02:05:01.850 --> 02:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
unmuting Andry muting everybody but
 
02:05:03.859 --> 02:05:03.869 align:start position:0%
clearly something is happening with
 
02:05:07.129 --> 02:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
those four connections and I don't know
 
02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:09.510 align:start position:0%
why it's acting differently free those
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
four people's I see David Welch
 
02:05:17.089 --> 02:05:17.099 align:start position:0%
represent Welch wanting to be unmuted
 
02:05:20.379 --> 02:05:20.389 align:start position:0%
again identical and I am hitting unmute
 
02:05:25.069 --> 02:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
there we go I've lost my I can't raise
 
02:05:29.979 --> 02:05:29.989 align:start position:0%
my hand other than this way so that's
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
this is all you know obviously this this
 
02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
is our first official action I'm also
 
02:05:38.839 --> 02:05:38.849 align:start position:0%
mindful the fact that we're that we're
 
02:05:40.850 --> 02:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
in an executive committee mode that
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
there are people who are watching on you
 
02:05:46.250 --> 02:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
know watching this on YouTube and
 
02:05:47.810 --> 02:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
YouTube members the public and I would
 
02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:49.170 align:start position:0%
like us to proceed because we're under
 
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
some time constraint so I know we'll all
 
02:05:53.569 --> 02:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
try to go forward it is representative
 
02:06:02.479 --> 02:06:02.489 align:start position:0%
rod still on represent rod I'm here so
 
02:06:05.089 --> 02:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
do I want I'm gonna recognize you for a
 
02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:08.730 align:start position:0%
motion I make a motion ought to pass as
 
02:06:08.730 --> 02:06:10.089 align:start position:0%
motion I make a motion ought to pass as
amended

02:06:10.089 --> 02:06:10.099 align:start position:0%
amended
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
second by represented panel aqus I see
 
02:06:20.049 --> 02:06:20.059 align:start position:0%
her hand up discussion I believe on this
 
02:06:20.059 --> 02:06:23.320 align:start position:0%
her hand up discussion I believe on this
and

02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:23.330 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:28.190 align:start position:0%
I will move on to the vote every time
 
02:06:35.110 --> 02:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
abbis ends up thank you so I've already
 
02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:38.590 align:start position:0%
explained my disapproval for the
 
02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:41.810 align:start position:0%
inconsistent logic that applies to you
 
02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:45.350 align:start position:0%
know he actively deciding what federal
 
02:06:46.930 --> 02:06:46.940 align:start position:0%
laws you want to fall which ones we
 
02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
laws you want to fall which ones we
don't

02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:47.770 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:52.430 align:start position:0%
now I also aggrieved representative all
 
02:06:54.610 --> 02:06:54.620 align:start position:0%
the sorrow above you know members of the
 
02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:57.110 align:start position:0%
Armed Services I take the position if
 
02:06:59.740 --> 02:06:59.750 align:start position:0%
you are mature enough to join our
 
02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:01.370 align:start position:0%
military whether by draft or
 
02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:05.210 align:start position:0%
volunteering you know that your you
 
02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:07.310 align:start position:0%
should have the right to you know have
 
02:07:10.810 --> 02:07:10.820 align:start position:0%
possessed tobacco now many retail is
 
02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:13.250 align:start position:0%
already requiring the age be 21 because
 
02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:15.170 align:start position:0%
of licensing issues now I'm not
 
02:07:17.590 --> 02:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
advocating anyone used to back up
 
02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:19.910 align:start position:0%
products regardless of your age but we
 
02:07:22.630 --> 02:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
literally just raise the age to 19 in
 
02:07:26.230 --> 02:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
September when we passed the budget so
 
02:07:28.090 --> 02:07:28.100 align:start position:0%
in the reason why I went from 18 to 19
 
02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:30.830 align:start position:0%
with the idea was to try to keep tobacco
 
02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:33.110 align:start position:0%
products out of the hands of kids in
 
02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:35.150 align:start position:0%
high school youth so we don't even
 
02:07:38.230 --> 02:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
really know the impact but the health
 
02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:41.210 align:start position:0%
and social policies aside you know this
 
02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:43.460 align:start position:0%
does raise it a constitutional issue
 
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:46.010 align:start position:0%
that we all can appreciate and there are
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
people right now who are you know ages
 
02:07:51.490 --> 02:07:51.500 align:start position:0%
19 to 20 who are already in possession
 
02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:54.230 align:start position:0%
of tobacco products so what is what they
 
02:07:56.590 --> 02:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
are lawfully possessing today will
 
02:07:59.590 --> 02:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
become illegal upon this bill becoming
 
02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:03.770 align:start position:0%
law now you know article 23 of our own
 
02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:07.390 align:start position:0%
State Constitution it says you know
 
02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:09.850 align:start position:0%
retrospective laws are highly an
 
02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:14.900 align:start position:0%
interest oppressive and unjust now but
 
02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:16.670 align:start position:0%
what that really amounts to it's it's
 
02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:19.070 align:start position:0%
called the constitutional taking you
 
02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:21.770 align:start position:0%
know in order to do that you know that
 
02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:24.130 align:start position:0%
person is entitled to just compensation
 
02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:27.770 align:start position:0%
now I understand you know the health
 
02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:29.330 align:start position:0%
concerns behind this but from a
 
02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:31.550 align:start position:0%
constitutional perspective we're taking
 
02:08:33.190 --> 02:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
someone's property interest away from
 
02:08:35.770 --> 02:08:35.780 align:start position:0%
them and literally giving them a provide
 
02:08:37.029 --> 02:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
them nothing in return
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
now that we can address that with an
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and not apply it the people
 
02:08:44.379 --> 02:08:44.389 align:start position:0%
who are already in possession of it but
 
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just explaining that you know on its
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
face as written
 
02:08:49.509 --> 02:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
I consider this bill to be
 
02:08:51.370 --> 02:08:51.380 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because we're simply
 
02:08:53.049 --> 02:08:53.059 align:start position:0%
not offering that person the
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
compensation so morals and emotions
 
02:09:00.689 --> 02:09:00.699 align:start position:0%
aside this bill really should be ITL
 
02:09:03.339 --> 02:09:03.349 align:start position:0%
because it's just it's clearly
 
02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:05.030 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so the first person is
 
02:09:07.089 --> 02:09:07.099 align:start position:0%
charged with that offense whether it's a
 
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
fine whatever they have an argument a
 
02:09:12.549 --> 02:09:12.559 align:start position:0%
made right okay represent analogous
 
02:09:16.209 --> 02:09:16.219 align:start position:0%
thank you I thought we were just looking
 
02:09:20.649 --> 02:09:20.659 align:start position:0%
at the penalties where we're we're in
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
we're the motion on the floor is on to
 
02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:26.090 align:start position:0%
pass with amendment okay but we're
 
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:28.010 align:start position:0%
supposed to just look at the penalties
 
02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:31.090 align:start position:0%
not whether its constitutional or
 
02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:37.210 align:start position:0%
anything like that right we're we're
 
02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
we're just we're discussing whether to
 
02:09:42.569 --> 02:09:42.579 align:start position:0%
build a lot to pass with amendment right
 
02:09:45.899 --> 02:09:45.909 align:start position:0%
any further discussion all right then
 
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
we've got hands up mr. chairman this guy
 
02:09:54.759 --> 02:09:54.769 align:start position:0%
represents winburn if I recall in
 
02:09:59.290 --> 02:09:59.300 align:start position:0%
reading over the bill it phases it in so
 
02:10:02.799 --> 02:10:02.809 align:start position:0%
that people who are now 20 have a year
 
02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:05.300 align:start position:0%
before it applies to them and people who
 
02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:09.250 align:start position:0%
are smoking and our 19 have two years I
 
02:10:13.479 --> 02:10:13.489 align:start position:0%
I can't look up the bill and keep all of
 
02:10:15.339 --> 02:10:15.349 align:start position:0%
you on my screen so I may not be
 
02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:18.050 align:start position:0%
remembering accurately but that was my
 
02:10:24.399 --> 02:10:24.409 align:start position:0%
impression I don't know no again I don't
 
02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:25.570 align:start position:0%
have an answer to that
 
02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:33.050 align:start position:0%
yeah representative over chairman I do
 
02:10:34.509 --> 02:10:34.519 align:start position:0%
think that when a bill is
 
02:10:37.330 --> 02:10:37.340 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional there is a penalty with
 
02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:40.090 align:start position:0%
it and there are some concerns
 
02:10:42.609 --> 02:10:42.619 align:start position:0%
constitutionally with this bill that
 
02:10:44.439 --> 02:10:44.449 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we did not have an
 
02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:46.730 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a constitutional
 
02:10:50.710 --> 02:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
attorney talk to us so I can share
 
02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:54.350 align:start position:0%
my colleagues comments about concerns
 
02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:57.290 align:start position:0%
and where we might be going as a state
 
02:10:59.860 --> 02:10:59.870 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chairman thank you very
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
Thank You mr. chairman thank you very
much

02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:00.290 align:start position:0%

02:11:02.770 --> 02:11:02.780 align:start position:0%
I represent baldesarra Thank You mr.
 
02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:05.710 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm looking under page three
 
02:11:08.410 --> 02:11:08.420 align:start position:0%
we're under a line 11 that says no
 
02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
person shall sell Gilbert earnest
 
02:11:12.130 --> 02:11:12.140 align:start position:0%
tobacco products
 
02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:15.230 align:start position:0%
he cigarettes or he liquid to a person
 
02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:18.290 align:start position:0%
who has not attained 21 years I don't
 
02:11:21.610 --> 02:11:21.620 align:start position:0%
see any type of a year or two year you
 
02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:25.610 align:start position:0%
know breaking the thing there my concern
 
02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:28.910 align:start position:0%
is this here bill you know is a
 
02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:31.370 align:start position:0%
feel-good bill we're worried about
 
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
anyone's health when New Hampshire is a
 
02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:36.950 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility state we have a
 
02:11:41.110 --> 02:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
no seatbelt no helmet we're going
 
02:11:43.090 --> 02:11:43.100 align:start position:0%
against the way hypocrites on one end
 
02:11:46.110 --> 02:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
saying you can smoke medical marijuana
 
02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
okay you have a medical card but you
 
02:11:50.350 --> 02:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
can't get in the military with that but
 
02:11:53.110 --> 02:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
yet if you're in the military forget it
 
02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:54.950 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be smoking we're bein
 
02:11:57.670 --> 02:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
brainy's or nannies I can't support this
 
02:11:58.920 --> 02:11:58.930 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:06.890 align:start position:0%
further discussion I was Abbess to the
 
02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:09.110 align:start position:0%
extent of my thank you the extent of my
 
02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:12.290 align:start position:0%
comments were not topical any when it
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
comes to penalties or punishments you
 
02:12:16.930 --> 02:12:16.940 align:start position:0%
know whether it's a fine misdemeanor or
 
02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:20.210 align:start position:0%
felony if the bill is unconstitutional
 
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be any penalty fine
 
02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:26.750 align:start position:0%
whether misdemeanor or felony that's
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
just my thought for the discussion it's
 
02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:33.470 align:start position:0%
not I guess we're we're ready for the
 
02:12:37.150 --> 02:12:37.160 align:start position:0%

02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:39.670 align:start position:0%

02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:15.170 align:start position:0%
well I mean if we want to just pass it
 
02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:17.030 align:start position:0%
you know have a study you know I
 
02:15:19.390 --> 02:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
understand I'm not sure how much
 
02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:22.270 align:start position:0%
studying is to be going on given the
 
02:15:24.610 --> 02:15:24.620 align:start position:0%
circumstances right now I mean to me
 
02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:26.930 align:start position:0%
this is then if we pass it's gonna then
 
02:15:28.750 --> 02:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
go through the Senate as we heard at the
 
02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:31.190 align:start position:0%
beginning of the onset that they have a
 
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
lot of responsibilities and they're
 
02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:35.630 align:start position:0%
gonna have to somewhat you know pick and
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
choose with what takes priority here so
 
02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:40.250 align:start position:0%
we can keep this off their plate you
 
02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:49.630 align:start position:0%
know okay we should do it in itla well
 
02:15:52.090 --> 02:15:52.100 align:start position:0%
any any further discussion I think we'll
 
02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:54.490 align:start position:0%
try to move on to move the question
 
02:15:56.860 --> 02:15:56.870 align:start position:0%

want to say that I agree with this area
 
02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:18.110 align:start position:0%
it probably is unconstitutional but it's
 
02:16:21.670 --> 02:16:21.680 align:start position:0%

02:19:11.330 --> 02:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
satisfactory I'd like to make a motion
 
02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:19.130 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.130 --> 02:19:20.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:19:20.830 --> 02:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:24.839 --> 02:19:24.849 align:start position:0%
that would be with amendment 1 2 4 9 H
 
02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:42.490 align:start position:0%
was at 16 62 or 1667 1 2 4 9 H I'm again
 
02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:47.030 align:start position:0%
not to deviate but I believe I'm not
 
02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:51.550 align:start position:0%
sure Pam would you check is representing
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
Sykes on the on the list he's that the
 
02:19:57.310 --> 02:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
chair of the Commerce of the
 
02:19:58.780 --> 02:19:58.790 align:start position:0%
Transportation Committee from which this
 
02:20:01.719 --> 02:20:01.729 align:start position:0%
bill came he would just be available if
 
02:20:03.130 --> 02:20:03.140 align:start position:0%
we had any questions I don't know if
 
02:20:04.810 --> 02:20:04.820 align:start position:0%
he's still there I haven't seen it if he
 
02:20:06.250 --> 02:20:06.260 align:start position:0%
is I'd want to Rocky
 
02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:09.590 align:start position:0%
I do not see him unless he's one of the
 
02:20:11.170 --> 02:20:11.180 align:start position:0%
phone callers there are two phone
 
02:20:18.490 --> 02:20:18.500 align:start position:0%
callers well we will we will address the
 
02:20:20.830 --> 02:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
Welch we met them the motion by
 
02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:23.570 align:start position:0%
representative Welch we can have to some
 
02:20:25.389 --> 02:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
discussion we can have that and move on
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
to to vote on the amendment represent
 
02:20:30.310 --> 02:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
well sir do you want to speak to you to
 
02:20:34.330 --> 02:20:34.340 align:start position:0%
the amendment for a second is there a
 
02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:38.270 align:start position:0%
second yes I see represent Bourdonnais
 
02:20:44.130 --> 02:20:44.140 align:start position:0%
is waving his hands all right under the
 
02:20:48.250 --> 02:20:48.260 align:start position:0%
the bill has a study committee to look
 
02:20:51.219 --> 02:20:51.229 align:start position:0%
at whether or not participants and drug
 
02:20:54.250 --> 02:20:54.260 align:start position:0%
court would be able to get a restricted
 
02:20:57.070 --> 02:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
license so they can attend the functions
 
02:21:02.889 --> 02:21:02.899 align:start position:0%
of their sign and there's not going to
 
02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:06.470 align:start position:0%
be any study committee set up so the
 
02:21:08.889 --> 02:21:08.899 align:start position:0%
amendment removes the study committee
 
02:21:13.150 --> 02:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
from the bill I think and I you know
 
02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
that representative Welch speaks to
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
something that I neglected to mention
 
02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:22.630 align:start position:0%
earlier there has been a suggestion that
 
02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:26.270 align:start position:0%
any bills that contain Study committee's
 
02:21:31.389 --> 02:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
will not pass this session and that's
 
02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:33.410 align:start position:0%
just kind of a realization we did not
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
want to get the
 
02:21:36.670 --> 02:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
fact that I believe that the purpose is
 
02:21:38.410 --> 02:21:38.420 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the fact that a bill
 
02:21:41.559 --> 02:21:41.569 align:start position:0%
included a Study Committee component did
 
02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:44.810 align:start position:0%
not get in the way of what otherwise was
 
02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:47.390 align:start position:0%
a sound underlying public policy that
 
02:21:53.710 --> 02:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
should be advanced representative Ober
 
02:21:59.620 --> 02:21:59.630 align:start position:0%
has her hand up I'm saying over sorry I
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
had to step out to take the phone call
 
02:22:07.210 --> 02:22:07.220 align:start position:0%
John courts get a grant from the state
 
02:22:10.149 --> 02:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
to operate this supposed to cover all
 
02:22:12.729 --> 02:22:12.739 align:start position:0%
their expenses there has been a group
 
02:22:15.610 --> 02:22:15.620 align:start position:0%
called friends of the drug court who
 
02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:20.050 align:start position:0%
have done fundraising and have provided
 
02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:23.750 align:start position:0%
funding for participants in drug court
 
02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:26.180 align:start position:0%
who don't have a license to be able to
 
02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:29.210 align:start position:0%
go to mandated drug court events etc I
 
02:22:31.479 --> 02:22:31.489 align:start position:0%
had a phone conversation with Chief
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
Justice Tina and Ned al she called me
 
02:22:36.969 --> 02:22:36.979 align:start position:0%
not about this bill but she called me
 
02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
because with the pandemic the Friends of
 
02:22:41.349 --> 02:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
the drug court are not able to raise
 
02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:43.970 align:start position:0%
money and she just wanted me to know
 
02:22:46.809 --> 02:22:46.819 align:start position:0%
that they had enough surplus in their
 
02:22:49.269 --> 02:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
grants that they were going to start to
 
02:22:51.580 --> 02:22:51.590 align:start position:0%
pay for transportation for these people
 
02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:54.350 align:start position:0%
to go to mandated events I don't know if
 
02:22:55.960 --> 02:22:55.970 align:start position:0%
that's sustainable for her in the long
 
02:22:58.090 --> 02:22:58.100 align:start position:0%
haul but it was the only way she could
 
02:23:02.229 --> 02:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
keep drug court going I think there's
 
02:23:04.899 --> 02:23:04.909 align:start position:0%
some thought if we think drug courts are
 
02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:07.370 align:start position:0%
viable to supporting the amendment and
 
02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
moving it forward Thank You mr. chairman
 
02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:13.790 align:start position:0%
I would I would note that the the bill
 
02:23:16.599 --> 02:23:16.609 align:start position:0%
the the amendment strip simply removes
 
02:23:19.570 --> 02:23:19.580 align:start position:0%
the study commission for the for the
 
02:23:23.380 --> 02:23:23.390 align:start position:0%
drug court for a special we call them
 
02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:25.850 align:start position:0%
Cinderella license which you know can
 
02:23:28.809 --> 02:23:28.819 align:start position:0%
separate apart from this doesn't does
 
02:23:31.149 --> 02:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
not mean that the underlying bill which
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
provides additional flexibility for the
 
02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:36.170 align:start position:0%
reinstatement of licenses or address
 
02:23:39.639 --> 02:23:39.649 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't go forward follow-up sir
 
02:23:43.780 --> 02:23:43.790 align:start position:0%
yes yes I recognize that but since that
 
02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
is a study committee and it's likely
 
02:23:48.430 --> 02:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
given our current legislative
 
02:23:50.530 --> 02:23:50.540 align:start position:0%
we should set a study committee could
 
02:23:53.230 --> 02:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
stall an entire bill I question whether
 
02:23:55.690 --> 02:23:55.700 align:start position:0%
we would want to stall an entire bill
 
02:23:57.911 --> 02:23:57.921 align:start position:0%
that had some things we all agreed with
 
02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:00.650 align:start position:0%
and so I supported removing this study
 
02:24:01.961 --> 02:24:01.971 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for letting me
 
02:24:04.511 --> 02:24:04.521 align:start position:0%

consent calendar this concludes our the
 
02:27:25.050 --> 02:27:25.060 align:start position:0%
work on our executive session at the
 
02:27:27.569 --> 02:27:27.579 align:start position:0%
outside I just want to say thank you to
 
02:27:30.990 --> 02:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
everybody for their hard work and
 
02:27:35.010 --> 02:27:35.020 align:start position:0%
participation in this it was our first
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
foray into meeting virtually both to
 
02:27:41.729 --> 02:27:41.739 align:start position:0%
have a work session and an exec session
 
02:27:44.849 --> 02:27:44.859 align:start position:0%
and I think it I think it went I think
 
02:27:45.899 --> 02:27:45.909 align:start position:0%
it went pretty well I know we're
 
02:27:47.490 --> 02:27:47.500 align:start position:0%
learning a lot all the technical
 
02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:48.850 align:start position:0%
problems are going to take a while for
 
02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
us to work out but it's it's good to
 
02:27:52.769 --> 02:27:52.779 align:start position:0%
know that that we can function I will
 
02:27:55.139 --> 02:27:55.149 align:start position:0%
tell members the committee I have we
 
02:27:57.051 --> 02:27:57.061 align:start position:0%
have in our possession two
 
02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:01.410 align:start position:0%
Senate bills that are that have been
 
02:28:03.921 --> 02:28:03.931 align:start position:0%
sent to us I also know that queued up
 
02:28:07.850 --> 02:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
are our four bills anyways that have
 
02:28:10.581 --> 02:28:10.591 align:start position:0%
been passed by the Senate that have not
 
02:28:13.791 --> 02:28:13.801 align:start position:0%
yet formally been transmitted to the
 
02:28:15.650 --> 02:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
house for introduction and referral to
 
02:28:18.291 --> 02:28:18.301 align:start position:0%
our committee and I also know that from
 
02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
conversations that there a number of
 
02:28:21.881 --> 02:28:21.891 align:start position:0%
other Senate bills that would be
 
02:28:23.900 --> 02:28:23.910 align:start position:0%
destined for our committee should that
 
02:28:27.171 --> 02:28:27.181 align:start position:0%
take place should the Senate get back
 
02:28:29.451 --> 02:28:29.461 align:start position:0%
into into action I think the house is a
 
02:28:31.001 --> 02:28:31.011 align:start position:0%
little bit ahead of the Senate right now
 
02:28:36.261 --> 02:28:36.271 align:start position:0%
in that regards I've asked to have to be
 
02:28:38.690 --> 02:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
able to schedule our public hearings on
 
02:28:40.820 --> 02:28:40.830 align:start position:0%
the two Senate bills as soon as possible
 
02:28:44.121 --> 02:28:44.131 align:start position:0%
and we'll see what will happen I don't
 
02:28:45.411 --> 02:28:45.421 align:start position:0%
know if anyone else had anything other
 
02:28:50.241 --> 02:28:50.251 align:start position:0%
Beth you have your hand up if the clerk
 
02:28:52.671 --> 02:28:52.681 align:start position:0%
would just over who has to write what
 
02:28:57.581 --> 02:28:57.591 align:start position:0%
reports which already many reports very
 
02:29:00.081 --> 02:29:00.091 align:start position:0%
you looking to be busy represent abroad
 
02:29:09.161 --> 02:29:09.171 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:12.201 --> 02:29:12.211 align:start position:0%
Harriet are you able to do that no no I
 
02:29:13.281 --> 02:29:13.291 align:start position:0%
just got to go through all this
 
02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:18.990 align:start position:0%
paperwork I don't know if there are any
 
02:29:20.751 --> 02:29:20.761 align:start position:0%
minority reports that are coming in but
 
02:29:25.701 --> 02:29:25.711 align:start position:0%
I get them to me by myself and Karen by
 
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at 4:30 and and the Rae and
