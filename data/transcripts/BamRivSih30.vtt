00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the subcommittees
 
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.790 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the subcommittees
um

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
needless to say i'm a little light on my
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
republican side so
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
i i i'll if we get to a place where we
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
want to have a you know
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
a serious thing it needs to say we won't
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
we will not take up any votes at this
 
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.110 align:start position:0%
we will not take up any votes at this
moment

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
but i think i think most of stuff you
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
know the way i've kind of visualized all
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
this i think we're we'll we should be
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
pretty well unified i think we should be
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
so we'll see how far we go
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
until we get to maybe homeowners
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
association bills and then we maybe then
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh start out with 15.95 relative to
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
establishing a statewide food truck
 
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.189 align:start position:0%
establishing a statewide food truck
license

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh is there anybody here who cares about
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
yes right just wanted to see okay so
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
just want to let i want to know who's in
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
the room so normally when we do
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittees we would never do it this
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
way we we're much more closer and
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
personal and
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
have contact and but obviously
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
covet changes everything um
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
if i understand this bill correctly
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
the idea was that we're going to create
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
a statute that was going to supersede
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
local communities
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
and i just don't see how that can work
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
and you would say well you know isn't it
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
terrible that you know couldn't you just
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
get one license and have it work
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
everywhere but at the end of the day
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
the 15 cities or the towns that care of
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
the most about it
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
are the ones that people are going to
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
want to have a truck park there
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
and as we say in retail it's all about
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
location location location
 
00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:39.350 align:start position:0%
location location location
and

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
so at this point i think what
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh i'm i'm willing an interim study
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
just to simply
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know that we'll take it up in
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
september and just see
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
is there some way we can find
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
some streamlined methodology
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
for licensure but it you know for
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
licensing these things but at this point
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
i did talk with the prime sponsor on
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
this last night and um
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
he knows that there are a lot of issues
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
with it he brought it forward because
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
the constituent requested it right he's
 
00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.430 align:start position:0%
the constituent requested it right he's
um

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
i think he'd be okay within our study or
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
he would also offer an amendment to
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
put together a small sub uh study
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the issues they i
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
mean we've got one
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
an activity coming up
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
and they'd like to be able to have more
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know several food trucks
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
and that is one of the issues that when
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
somebody you know in some town that
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
wants to put together a
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
a fairly good size
 
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.870 align:start position:0%
a fairly good size
um

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
activity that they like more than you
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
know a few
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry can you come up and speak
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
and introduce yourself so everybody
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
knows who you are thank you
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
colleen smith i'm the administrator of
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
the food protection section within dhhs
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
so if it's a one day event they're
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
exempt from our license some of these
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting cities and towns do
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
license temporary one-day events but
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
if by law if they're operating four days
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
or less in a 30-day period or in
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
conjunction with a temporary event like
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
a fair festival that's not greater than
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
14 days they're exempt from our food
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
license well that's even better yeah
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
so that kind of takes care of that
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
problem huh yeah i think that it does
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll be glad to report back he was
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
unable to be here today okay so you'll
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
let him know that okay well maybe we
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
don't really need i mean the interim say
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
i was just thinking that we just keep it
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
around so we could talk about yes
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
yeah we have a bill coming up 1043 that
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
i think we should uh recommend
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
otp because it's establishing a
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
committee to study regulations
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh applicable to small business that
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
sell food and that would include uh push
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
carts i mean and uh food trucks push
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
carts we've got that one solved so
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
this one here uh
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
do we would rather have a i i i don't
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
really like study committees i would
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
rather keep it in in-house right don't
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
you think that somebody
 
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.870 align:start position:0%
you think that somebody
why

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
aren't we going to be studying this
 
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.870 align:start position:0%
aren't we going to be studying this
issue

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying if we okay if so which
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
one you're saying you think we should
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
1043. you think you should we should
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
pass 1043. yes and uh put the first and
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
second bill into 1043 and that would be
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
well we just yeah well we don't have to
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
because it's already in there right
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
isn't it already in 1043
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know you have the
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
language of 10 43 pretty much
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
i have a question well that's something
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
we can decide which way my preference
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
would be to keep a bill if you had a
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
choice if i had a choice between a study
 
00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.430 align:start position:0%
choice if i had a choice between a study
committee

00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
or have it within the committee
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
i would rather keep it in the committee
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
because the study committee doesn't mean
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
we're going to get appointed to it who
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
knows who's going to get appointed to
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
that study committee so you're saying
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
this is going to be interim study so
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing that interim
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
study would be that is in my mind is
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes better than a study committee
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
so would we do interim study for the
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
first three
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
no i just want to interim study uh just
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
one of them i i would only inter study
 
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.069 align:start position:0%
one of them i i would only inter study
uh

00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
this this first one but let me let me
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
see let me see what the dude
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay okay i can also you if i don't make
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
sense i understand
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
i've been told that before but okay
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
okay state local rail including food
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
licensing food safety can i ask a
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
question of miss smith yes
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you um so would this apply
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
though to the towns that have their own
 
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.870 align:start position:0%
though to the towns that have their own
ordinances

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
the the temporary situation temporaries
 
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.590 align:start position:0%
the the temporary situation temporaries
yes

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
no many of them do license temporary
 
00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.509 align:start position:0%
no many of them do license temporary
events

00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
events
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
this would just that would just apply to
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
those operating in the state's
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction okay okay thanks very much
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and i don't know who the
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
question is for so if somebody can
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
provide an answer that would be awesome
 
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.829 align:start position:0%
provide an answer that would be awesome
uh

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
from my understanding from testimony is
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
there is a state license
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
that covers everything except for these
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
was it 15 cities that self license
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
then you have to go to each individual
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
city to get licensed in each of those
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
individual cities
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
so is there a way that we could have a
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
state license that allows you to operate
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
outside of those like a normal but then
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
a license that we can arrange with these
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
15 communities that they can that they
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
can get it's one license to allow them
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
to operate in those 15 it's a separate
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
license they would have to get that
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
allows them to get because we understand
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
that these licenses and the inspections
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
and all that has to do with revenue for
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
those cities and they inspect but if we
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
had one license that allows them that
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
they can purchase optionally it's like a
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
super mega license
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
so you can operate throughout the state
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
and then you buy the super plus and then
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
you can operate inside those cities as
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
well and then we could still figure out
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
the you know how to get inspected if
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
you're inspected in one city it's valid
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
in all the cities or whatever something
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
like that but that way
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
they can go to each individual city if
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
they want because that's where they're
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to be operating only
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
but if they want to be able to operate
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
or expand and franchise out they
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to buy individual licenses
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
they could buy that one big super
 
00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:39.590 align:start position:0%
they could buy that one big super
license

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
the answer is no okay right and this
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
goes and this goes back to john hunt's
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
rule of licensure
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
why do we create licensure
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
this licensure is our methodology it's
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
our hammer
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
to shut you down when you've been bad
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
so that little
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
town that city
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
wants to be able to issue the license to
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
operate in that city
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
if to say is we don't we think we have a
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
problem with you we want to shut you
 
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
problem with you we want to shut you
down

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
that city can't the only way you can
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
exert that authority is it has its own
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
licensure its own little baby
 
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.710 align:start position:0%
licensure its own little baby
okay

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
to say that we're going to create a
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
state license how does that little city
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
going to shut down that business
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
if your license is actually a state
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
can't we work with them to figure out
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
a means again this would be the super
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
license that allows these people to
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
operate in those cities and we can get
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
them to agree that hey if this guy is
 
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.150 align:start position:0%
them to agree that hey if this guy is
violating

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
violating
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
then we have the ability some kind of
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
ability to to
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
nip that license if he's violating
 
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.350 align:start position:0%
nip that license if he's violating
something

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
but rather than going to 15 different
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
cities you're not going to 15 different
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
cities because you're never going to
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
operate in 15 different cities
 
00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.829 align:start position:0%
operate in 15 different cities
no

00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:00.629 align:start position:0%
no
no

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:01.350 align:start position:0%
no
no

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
okay you remember the food trucks that
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
used to go around
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
at lunchtime fleet of them yeah those
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
food trucks at lunchtime i know what
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
they call it
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
the roach coach absolutely okay
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
the roach coach never went beyond one
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
city i understand that okay what if he
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
wants 16 roach coaches what if this guy
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
is super entrepreneur
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
if that if there's a super entrepreneur
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
wants to say i'm going to do all these
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
different activities he has to he'll
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
probably identify which vehicle is going
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.150 align:start position:0%
in that
city

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
city
 
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
and therefore get the license for that
 
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.189 align:start position:0%
and therefore get the license for that
city

00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
city
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
the issue is we do have a super license
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
we have a super license as long as you
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
don't go
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
to these 15 communities where there's
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
money to be made
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
and and the logic is that each one of
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
those little and i know that you're
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the money okay
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at as the rule of licensure
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at as the whole the whole
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
reason they license them in the first
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
place is that if as soon as you
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
sell that use you know that salamilla
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
point you know poison they want to be
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
able to shut you down
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
right then and there and they don't want
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
to the sauerkraut that's really sour
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
that's how it's corrupted
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
i was thinking about that low main
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
that kid in massachusetts so so at any
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
rate uh so the answer is no you really
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
can't fill it okay
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
this study committee i just read over
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
this study committee
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.069 align:start position:0%
in uh
1043

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
1043
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
this thing is all over the map
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
and and and it only has one person from
 
00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:36.310 align:start position:0%
and and and it only has one person from
commerce

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know and that so it's really it's
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
like all these other committees are real
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture they're all
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
the ones who are i don't know do you
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
really want to pass this i wouldn't want
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
to pass this
 
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.669 align:start position:0%
to pass this
right

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
well i would i would
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so i would like to interim study
 
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.669 align:start position:0%
yeah so i would like to interim study
1595

00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
1595
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
and then we'll kill 1095 and 1043 and
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you why in a moment
 
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.630 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you why in a moment

and somebody might not have been paying
 
00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:08.630 align:start position:0%
and somebody might not have been paying
attention

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
i have a question he knows more about
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem with the
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
motion of uh interim study on this bill
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
can i ask why we wouldn't just itl this
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
because we have we want to have one
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
study committee to talk about this whole
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
licensure of vehicles
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
and and just have one vehicle
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
to talk about it okay
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
because i just see a lot of problems
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
with this bill it's just bad
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's not bad every bill has a grain of
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
truth to it i know what this does is it
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
costs the state
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
i mean it will cost more to do this than
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
we'll make in revenue and then you're
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
taking away revenue from the
 
00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:18.870 align:start position:0%
taking away revenue from the
municipalities

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
so i don't no we well i i let's the rule
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
of licensure does not include
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
worrying about fees
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's not about a money maker i and i
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
really i have to say to you i mean
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
all due respect for your party but we
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
republicans were are somewhat conscious
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
of the fact that
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
licensure should not be about a revenue
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
generating to the state of new hampshire
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
it should only the license should only
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
be to match the cost that it would take
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
us to implement that statute
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
that we used to have uh a rep av davis
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
who she was on
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
ways and means and she was the god of
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
licensure and she she would goddess and
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
licensure and she would make sure that
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
no fee was absorbent you know there was
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
never intended to be a revenue generator
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
right but we
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
but what if you look at the fiscal note
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying is it would cost
 
00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:09.990 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying is it would cost
83

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
83
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
700 to hire a person
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
to manage this and we would only get
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
about 40 000 in revenue so that's what
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
i'm doing nothing else that's a good
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
reason to kill to not pass this bill
 
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.270 align:start position:0%
reason to kill to not pass this bill
right

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's why i was suggesting itl but i
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
can do interim study i'm okay with that
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay good just
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
all right so uh representative ham is
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
here all right good
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative greeson is replacing
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
just a lot shorter
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay and a lot and representative
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
johnson's not here okay so
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh and then oh but i have yeah i'll take
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
johnson so i have patoo okay
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
all right now we're in good shape who
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
would like to uh write the blurb for
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
don't jump up if it wasn't okay
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
all right i will move uh interim study
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative patusek is
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee so what happens when
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
we get to the full committee
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
then we've already done the subcommittee
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
work whatever and and and to be honest
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
why i do it this way is that sometimes
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
someone will come in with an amendment
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i go well where were you when we had
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee with your amendment
 
00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.390 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee with your amendment
so

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's my rationale of doing it this way
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
could you could you repeat the bills
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
that are going
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
into this so the net right now
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
this is just this bill we're doing is
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
15.95 okay
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
is interim study
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the next two i'm going to it out yes
 
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
and the next two i'm going to it out yes
okay

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
so you've got some subs for
 
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.350 align:start position:0%
so you've got some subs for
your

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
your side
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes i'm all set
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
so all those in favor please raise your
 
00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:09.830 align:start position:0%
so all those in favor please raise your
hand

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
one two three i'm just gonna assume it's
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
eight people okay
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
so they can count it up for me
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
all right one
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
down 24 to go okay
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
10.95 a sale of fresh condiments and
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
pushcarts selling frankfurters and
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
a day or two after the hearing i had
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
this brilliant idea why wouldn't we
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
do like new york city and have a
 
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.029 align:start position:0%
do like new york city and have a
uh

00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
a push card plus
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
so that you could have all the perks and
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
everything as a push card plus
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
uh and then we did a little research and
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
found out that uh the new york city does
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
require that you have a restaurant
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
being affiliated in a facility so i went
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
through that going through all that
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
and finally i talked to uh
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative wild and and the sponsor
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
actually that yeah the the guy he his
 
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.510 align:start position:0%
actually that yeah the the guy he his
constituent

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
and it came down to what he really
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
really wanted was the chili dog
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's what it was all about it was
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
about the chili dog
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
and so then this took me another
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
couple of hours i don't know how it took
 
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
me to figure this out and i said
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
well heck
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
we already allow
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
these push guard guys to have anything
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
that's in a single use packaging
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
and which evidently much to my amazement
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
that you can get sauerkraut in a single
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
use packaging
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
okay but you can get anything in a
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
single use packaging including
 
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.710 align:start position:0%
single use packaging including
chili

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
chili
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
and so i dually called up
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
the department and she said no problem
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's already in the rule
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
because it's a single used packaging we
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
all they have to do is have the cider on
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know on the that biscuit side of
 
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.430 align:start position:0%
you know on the that biscuit side of
these

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
the uh that have the
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
the chili
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
and you know maybe something else i
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe you can have baked
 
00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe you can have baked
beans

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
beans
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
you can have anything you want so
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah i think what um what the
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
food car or the push carts um or the hot
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
dog stands what they need to do is
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
partner up with a commissary not that
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
they need to you know spend a lot of
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
money in the commissary or time but they
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
can um uh if if they want to have you
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
know their recipe or chili you know
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
produced in little packages they can go
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
to a commissary that's licensed by the
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
state and they can get it from there or
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
they can buy it from the grocery store
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
but if you work with a commissary then
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know the ingredients and you can you
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
know and it's not a big deal you know
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
they they can a commissary can you know
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
charge them
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the issue was that they really
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
don't want to do business with the
 
00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:01.590 align:start position:0%
don't want to do business with the
commissary

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
commissary
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
they don't want to do business because
 
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.909 align:start position:0%
they don't want to do business because
the

00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
the commission the local kid whatever
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
around them are going to treat them as
 
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.950 align:start position:0%
around them are going to treat them as
competitors

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
competitors
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
no well
 
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
no well
okay

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
so that that was the the person who came
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
in who introduced the bill that was his
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
he was worried about in sunapee that he
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
was you know that but the commissary as
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
i now learned is a much more complicated
 
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.029 align:start position:0%
i now learned is a much more complicated
problem

00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
and so it's not it's not easy
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
even just having the commentary because
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's still the whole point is their
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
kitchen is certified and registered and
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
yada yada yada and um but anyway so the
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
simple solution is as long as that cart
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
has everything in a single use packaging
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
they can go ahead and sell it to the
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
consumer there
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
but under existing law right now if
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
somebody hooks up with the commissary
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
they can do a sidewalk
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
food stand correct so that's legal
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit different you want
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
to do it that way yes okay
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
all the more reason to kill the bill
 
00:27:11.919 --> 00:27:12.789 align:start position:0%
all the more reason to kill the bill
then

00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative mclaren but
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the the mustard
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
and the ketchup that he uses is in a
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
pre-manufactured package correct so
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
this the hot dog guy can't make his own
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
chili and put it into a package correct
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
therefore it seems to me that some
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial will make millions
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
pre-packaging uh chile
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
so i think if there's any entrepreneurs
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
i guess i would look at the department
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
and say uh think of that uh
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
that somewhat problematic
 
00:27:52.799 --> 00:27:54.230 align:start position:0%
that somewhat problematic
because

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
um if i understand correctly if somebody
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
were just you know they if they had the
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
proper kitchen
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
to how they seal that package that would
 
00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:04.470 align:start position:0%
to how they seal that package that would
actually

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
comply with the rule so that they could
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
you want to come over here said i'm
 
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.669 align:start position:0%
you want to come over here said i'm
sorry

00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
just stay there for until we get yeah
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
just you can sit here and we'll stay
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
here until we get through these three
 
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.389 align:start position:0%
here until we get through these three
bills

00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
so so they if they could get licensed to
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
make those pre-packaged
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
chili cups or if they're hermetically
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
stealing them they would have to um you
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
know submit a plan and show that they're
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
packaging them safely but there there
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
would be a pathway for them to do that
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
so like a deli
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
so what's the deli there and jackson
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
there the uh the only one that stays
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
open for lunch
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
the jackson tele so
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
so they would have to still submit a
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
plan that they were going to be selling
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
these to a third party yes
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
okay because otherwise they can sell
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
them now they can you know put it in the
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
refrigerator and sell it now a deli can
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
do that now yes right but in terms of
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
selling it to a third party would they
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
go through jump some hoops to do that if
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
they were going to give it to a cart as
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
long as they have a it depends on again
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
how they're packaging if they're
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
packaging it to be shelf stable then um
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
we would definitely want to look at
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
their process because they'd have to it
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
have to go under sealed has to be sealed
 
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.789 align:start position:0%
have to go under sealed has to be sealed
exactly

00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
so but if it was just
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
they they could do a deli could do it
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
they have seven days for the customer to
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
use it without any kind of additional uh
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
like thermal processing okay
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett um thanks mr
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
chair so in the blurb that if it goes
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
into the consent calendar um it would be
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
important for the person that writes
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
this to just kind of say
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are rules in place for this they
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
can be covered so the constituent
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
understands that it was really
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
not going against what he was asking

and uh they found eight uh references
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
that still needed to be corrected and
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
readjusted um so hopefully that'll be uh
 
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.070 align:start position:0%
readjusted um so hopefully that'll be uh
uh

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
available sometime today so at this
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
point um we're not gonna take up 1503 at
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
this moment we'll we'll wait
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
now here's the deal on 1503 it is a
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
hundred page bill
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
so uh once we once it's available we
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
making it available as a pdf for anybody
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
and everybody who really wants to read
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
it and go into it and get into detail
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:34.470 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
yeah no that's fine
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
but once we get it we'll get the we have
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
to get the new hampshire version of it
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
so that that should be available today
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
so at this point we're not going to take
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
up because we it's not we don't have it
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
i'd be interested to hear what your what
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
but in this document you can knowingly
 
00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.950 align:start position:0%
but in this document you can knowingly
accept

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
accept
 
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.389 align:start position:0%
accept
um

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
um
stolen

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
stolen
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
bitcoin type of cyber crypto currencies
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
and there's no repercussions from the
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
person who buys them and i think that's
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
a real issue
 
00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:42.710 align:start position:0%
a real issue
okay

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
so we will we will make sure that once
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
we get the new hampshire version you can
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
see whether that's still in there or
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
whether they it's interpreted
 
00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:55.510 align:start position:0%
whether they it's interpreted
differently

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
what amendment is that
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay so my amendment was we would call
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
ucc light
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
which basically did nothing other than
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:14.210 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.630 align:start position:0%
so
[Laughter]

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.230 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
okay

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
so no that's why that that that was that
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
was the first um
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
if if we had to have this bill out
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
before you know what you know early okay
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
which was actually it wasn't 1503 i
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
think it was 1502
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
with which we had to get out early so
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
the 1503
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
because that one was um did not have a
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal note to it
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
that was the one that we just that we
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
would then be able to dodge that bullet
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
to having to take action right away with
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
the original 1502
 
00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.670 align:start position:0%
the original 1502
the

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
once issue get a little closer to the
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
mic so everybody at home can hear you
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
we were discussing this in the beginning
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%

suggest that everybody on the committee
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
pull that up um on npr well it's about
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
the problems that china's had because
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
china trying to decide they they
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't control it three years ago when
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
we were here discussing a bill very
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
similar to this um you know one of the
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
arguments was well if we don't do
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
something about it china's going to come
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
in because they're doing so much right
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
now they're out of it completely for a
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
lot of good reasons
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
no i didn't say there was a lot of good
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
reasons oh well i have to disagree i
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
tried to listen to that new story
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
completely really i would really suggest
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
that everybody listen to that article
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
and he said it took too much electricity
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's probably you know at least 10 or 15
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
minutes long
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
so but here's my take on this that
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
actually what was interesting was the
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
fact that um
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
where their their setup is in nebraska
 
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.910 align:start position:0%
where their their setup is in nebraska
okay

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
and i have no idea what nebraska has
 
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.190 align:start position:0%
and i have no idea what nebraska has
done

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
but i do know one thing about nebraska
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
is that there are unicamery legislature
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
and so they they don't have a feature
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
that we have here in new hampshire
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
and that is that
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this bill
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
and send it over to the senate
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
that there will be a whole new set of
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
eyes a whole new pause
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
to really go through it and really make
 
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.910 align:start position:0%
to really go through it and really make
sure

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
that this thing is safe and and that yes
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
it is true the senate might punt and
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
just say we'll wait for the governor's
 
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.950 align:start position:0%
just say we'll wait for the governor's
commission

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.829 align:start position:0%
commission
okay

00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:20.950 align:start position:0%
okay
or

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
they might hear that everyone thinks
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
this is the cat's meow
 
00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:26.150 align:start position:0%
this is the cat's meow
and

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
let's let's go for it
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
and send it to the governor so and i
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
would say that that the one advantage we
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
do have is we are a bicameral
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
legislation and so yes there will be
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
plenty of chances to to
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
get go through this piece of legislation
 
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.710 align:start position:0%
get go through this piece of legislation
yes

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
banking um credit unions i mean how do
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
they feel about this bill
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
they uh all are okay they are all with
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
us concept of the ucc yes they think
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
this is a great idea and here's the
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
reason why they think it's a great idea
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
the most offensive bill was 1504
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
which was the creation of a whole new
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
division in the bank department
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
that was the worst possible scenario
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
you could imagine
 
00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.630 align:start position:0%
you could imagine
creating

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
creating
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
50 by doing 1503 as a ucc simply a ucc
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
statute not only the the department that
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
we have that oversees it okay the
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
securities had immediately come in with
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
the appropriate language
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
to address their issues
 
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.069 align:start position:0%
to address their issues
but

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
in their uh over in the secretary of
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
state's office we have our our guru our
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
ucc guru
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
who has been working on this so this is
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
all done within the state agencies in
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
terms of making this ucc thing work
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
and and frankly uh if if in any moment
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
any banks or credit unions or anybody
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
come in and say no this is not a good
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
idea i would have you know
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
i would have shut the whole thing down
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
but at this point everybody is very
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
excited about us
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
going forward with this
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
and i certainly hope you will find that
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
true too
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative weston yes thank you um
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
i i think that that
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
the difference here is by the way
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
pakistan and india are also
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
on the move to ban
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
this industry completely so it's not
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
just china it's some of the major
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
industrial countries
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
i think that the banks and the big
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
financial firms are interested in seeing
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
how they can make money off it
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're not going to put themselves at
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
risk they just want to be able to make
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
money off it which is why they're not
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to it
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
but i think we need to
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
really watch this industry very
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
carefully because it's
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's a dangerous industry it's full of
 
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.670 align:start position:0%
it's a dangerous industry it's full of
fraud

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
well here's my concern just to address
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
that issue right now
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
right now and this is herbert ii
 
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.390 align:start position:0%
right now and this is herbert ii
is

00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
i didn't i'm not sure i
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
i i bought some mead from from our you
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
know my meetery and he and then somehow
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
i ended up i got a 40 discount if i sign
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
up with paypal
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
credit card evidently i now have a
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
paypal credit card not that they sent me
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
a card but i got it
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
but then so then i'm now going to go
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
online to pay my bill
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
and right there in paypal
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
they're taking crypto
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
they're taking it this is it's out there
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's out there is exchanging is doing it
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
so shouldn't we make sure
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:41:37.839 --> 00:41:39.349 align:start position:0%
that uh
if

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:40.150 align:start position:0%
if
if

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
this is out there
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm i assume paypal is a fine
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
upstanding entity and not a money
 
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.570 align:start position:0%
upstanding entity and not a money
launderer

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:48.580 align:start position:0%
launderer
 
00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:49.750 align:start position:0%
launderer
[Music]

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
they they aren't going to invest in it
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
they're just going to make money off it
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
here's the point
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
what banks in terms of like as those of
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
us who have trust
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay that so those of us have trust yeah
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
did there some of us would want and some
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
of them have trust issues
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
that they would we would want to maybe
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
put it in our portfolio and have our
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
portfolio managers keeping an eye on and
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
tracking and reporting on it for us
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay so i understand
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little scary it's no no i'm not
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
running out to buy it but i don't do
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
gold either
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay you know
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
but at the same time it's out there and
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't it make sense for the state
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
to at least um you know create take what
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
is going to become law
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
in every state in the next four or five
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
years but gambling is out there too and
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
some of us gamble and some don't
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
yeah we're making lots of money off of
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
that now right from
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the super bowl then when they find
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
25 percent of our betters were from
 
00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.630 align:start position:0%
25 percent of our betters were from
massachusetts

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
but there's another issue here we do not
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be first in the
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
nation here i mean there are places
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
where new hampshire wants to be first in
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
the nation but i think this is such a
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
a delicate thing here it's very
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
i just don't think this is where we want
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
to put out the welcome mat
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
and the business with the trust i mean
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
when the pandora papers were stolen who
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
was sighted in there new hampshire is
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
one of the places where oligarchs can
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
come and hide their tainted money
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
i just don't think this is where new
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire wants to be okay well you're
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to your opinion and
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure your constituents would think
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right new hampshire
 
00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:36.710 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right new hampshire
should

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
stay in the hinderlands on this on this
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
issue representative herbert
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
um a question i have is
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
if the federal government sup does the
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
federal government have the ability to
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
supersede the ucc
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
if they find it to be
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
something that they don't want to deal
 
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:55.990 align:start position:0%
something that they don't want to deal
with

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government would always have
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
the authority to supersede anything any
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
state does
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay so okay but that's you
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
just understand the nature of ucc
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
is that and the reason why this is
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
number 12.
 
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.309 align:start position:0%
number 12.
okay

00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
if you go back and look at all the old
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
ucc you know the statutes
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's there is as old as our
 
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.950 align:start position:0%
there's there is as old as our
rsas

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay and the reason being was that the
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
federal government had made the decision
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
that they weren't going to
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
create all the one super federal law
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
they were going to leave it up to each
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
individual state to have model
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
legislation in which every state had the
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
similar statute
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not this
 
00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.109 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not this
further

00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
would you believe i'm not questioning
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
the previous ucc
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh decisions right um what i am
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
questioning is that this particular area
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
should be a federal matter at minimum
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
and and i'm i'm positive that that's
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
where it's going to end up and uh
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
and so therefore
 
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.670 align:start position:0%
and so therefore
um

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i you know my point of view anyway
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes do you think it's money current
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
money not a banking issue
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
and uh and
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
as a result the banks may be able to
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
make a commission on
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
getting their fingers in in this uh pie
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh we we i have a currency issue problem
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
and so therefore it's i find it very
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
problematic fair enough okay yes
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann oh i have a
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
is the objection
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
property

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
because if if the if the objection is
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
that it's i hear concerns about fraud
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
and money laundering well that's been
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
going on long before we ever had a
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
personal computer
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
but if the objection is that it is
 
00:45:58.319 --> 00:45:59.349 align:start position:0%
but if the objection is that it is
digital

00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
digital
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
the federal reserve is already working
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
to establish a a digital dollar a
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
digital currency
 
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
so if you're worried about digital
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
take it up with the fed because it's
 
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.030 align:start position:0%
take it up with the fed because it's
coming

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure i understand what excuse
 
00:46:14.319 --> 00:46:16.150 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure i understand what excuse
me

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
i understand but i'm saying that the
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
paper dollar is going to go away and
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
is that this rumor has the federal
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
government was playing with the digital
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
concept but they haven't they're not
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
actually stated they're working on it
 
00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:32.630 align:start position:0%
actually stated they're working on it
i

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
what i read is that it ain't happening
 
00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:35.990 align:start position:0%
what i read is that it ain't happening
okay

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the coin is just
 
00:46:38.319 --> 00:46:39.430 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the coin is just
remember

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
there are multiple companies in this
 
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.270 align:start position:0%
there are multiple companies in this
industry

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
bitcoin is not
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
is it's just it's it's their competitors
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
so it's a free marketplace on the these
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
choices of products are out there
 
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.030 align:start position:0%
choices of products are out there
so

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
it is not a currency it's a commodity it
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
is and and i would have to tell you that
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things when and and when i
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
spent many hours when they had the
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
original subcommittee the banking
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
department always took the position that
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
it was not currency
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
that it was a commodity and she called
 
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.829 align:start position:0%
that it was a commodity and she called
them

00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
beanie babies
 
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.230 align:start position:0%
beanie babies
okay

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think we care that it's digital
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
i mean i think that
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
what bothers me is exempting it from
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
security laws
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
what is the need to exempt them from
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
security laws i mean
 
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.270 align:start position:0%
security laws i mean
yeah

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
okay so you were right it's only 20
 
00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:48.790 align:start position:0%
okay so you were right it's only 20
pages

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
so can anyone answer my question
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's not as it's not a security
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's your opinion exactly that's your
 
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.430 align:start position:0%
that's your opinion exactly that's your
opinion

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.470 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
yeah the sec has ruled it is not a
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
security it's not traded as a security
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's treated as property
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
it everybody has a copy of it
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
and you can use it as
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
on your snow day reading
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
and hopefully it will make you go to
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
sleep early and we'll be taking this up
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.270 align:start position:0%
next week
okay

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
but i i would i sure hope i mean i i

hear your concerns and i hope you guys
 
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.349 align:start position:0%
hear your concerns and i hope you guys
will

00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh use the resources you have and the
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
people you know
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
to communicate and people you trust
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh to find out whether you know you this
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
is something you want to get behind but
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
i would not i'd say myself personally i
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
would not be pushing this if i did not
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
think this was a good thing for new
 
00:49:12.319 --> 00:49:13.430 align:start position:0%
think this was a good thing for new
hampshire

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
and it's not you know as you know i'm
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
not that partisan
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
and and so i i really do think that this
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
was a great solution
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
um in terms of how the role we play um
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
and like i say i was around when we
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
basically decided that we were going to
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
have no statutes no law
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
regulating this and leaving it up to the
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office for someone
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
just you know to use you know the right
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
or pride of action and suing and just
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that that
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
this is the industry is matured enough
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
to get to this point i think we don't
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
doubt your sincerity mr chair it doesn't
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
mean we'll necessarily agree with you
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
but we don't doubt your sincerity okay
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
so i just hope you you know check in and
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
talk to people about it because i think
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
you'll find there we are talking don't
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
worry good moving thank you uh
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
in in reference to the concern about um
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
penalties for receiving stolen property
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's a valid concern
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
but does the ucc
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
i i have no idea well i don't know
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
what's in here
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
we'll read it we'll read it and find out
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
do they normally would they normally
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
address that issue
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
is that something that would have been
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
addressed in chapters 1 through 11 that
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
have been adopted previously
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
or would that be something i
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:44.790 align:start position:0%

okay so representative patusek is
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
i am adding for
 
00:53:16.319 --> 00:53:17.109 align:start position:0%
i am adding for
this

00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
and that is a
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
on this on on business and that is a
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we're talking about the
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
because i want to get through all of
 
00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:36.950 align:start position:0%
this you know
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:40.150 align:start position:0%
this you know
[Laughter]

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.750 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
okay

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
all right so so does that so is greason
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
off of insurance
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
no he's just on here right now
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
so these two homeowners bill because i i
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
don't think i would ever have created
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
this list of
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
i mean i've always would have had a
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
republican majority including you know
 
00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:03.589 align:start position:0%
republican majority including you know
so

00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
at any rate
 
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.950 align:start position:0%
at any rate
um

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.630 align:start position:0%
um
god

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
god
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
in all due respect
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
for us to
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
tell condos
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
that they have to accept something they
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to accept
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
is just an anathema to me i just can't i
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
can't i just can't get my arms around
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
forcing them and i realize you want
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
solar and you really want to have solar
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
and solar is you know
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
if nothing else we would
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
we would love to see pvs on every
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
every house
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
because then we would be generating
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
electricity you know and and good
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
electricity not
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear or or gas generated electricity
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
to run our electric cars that we're all
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
going to have okay
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
so there's no doubt in my mind i you
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
know i i am you know as someone who owns
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.750 align:start position:0%
you know
78

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
78
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
kilowatts of you know
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
pvs you know i'm i'm absolutely with you
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day the problem of
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
these homeowners association condos you
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
know whatever
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
is that you know when you buy into it
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
you're buying into that that everybody
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
there is going to be on the same page
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
and if you got a homeowner's association
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
where there's some stick in the muds who
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
say no i don't want your house to have
 
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.030 align:start position:0%
say no i don't want your house to have
pvs

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
pvs
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
you know i want everybody's house to
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
look the same
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
all right then you you've sold your soul
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
socialist government if i was to say
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
but you know that but obviously you know
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
you you're you still have the right to
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
ability to convince everybody in your
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
community that it'd be okay
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
but if if there are stick in the months
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
who don't want it
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
how do we how how
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
is that really right for the state to
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
force it on them
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
may i just yes
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
first of all this is enabling this is
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
not it's not a mandate uh as a matter of
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
fact it's the reverse of a mandate it
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
allows the freedom
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
of being able to put solar onto your
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
the mandate being that the association
 
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:16.789 align:start position:0%
the mandate being that the association
could

00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
say refuse
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's a mandate to me that you're
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
telling the association that if somebody
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
wants to put this on the roof they have
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
to accept it
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
is that not mandated no because this is
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
only enabling legislation so you have
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
ordinances and other layers on top of
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
this we're talking about the state level
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
here but um what i'm saying about is not
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
being a mandate is that it's allowing
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
freedom of the individual to have a
 
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.589 align:start position:0%
freedom of the individual to have a
choice

00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
not requiring the
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
the individual individual to do anything
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not a mandate in that sense so i
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify terminology off off
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
the topic yeah but i disagree with you
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
totally that's okay we've
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
disagreed you're saying it's
 
00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.510 align:start position:0%
disagreed you're saying it's
individual

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
this is an individual who lives in a
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
community yes and they want to force
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
to do something when they okay that the
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
community could have
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
voluntarily agreed with them
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
and let them do it
 
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
but the community didn't and that's the
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
reason why you have this legislation in
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
front of us right and the issues that
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
the the constituents to whom i've spoken
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
and i've spoken to very many because of
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
where i live where i live is fraught
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
with uh condos and and homeowners
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
associations uh the issues that they
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
have there are two-fold uh one many of
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
these documents were crafted and as we
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
heard crafted decades ago
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
the the utility of of solar has grown
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
the cost-effectiveness of solar has
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
grown the interest in solar has grown
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
and so they these people are saying that
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
the documents while they did exist and
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
they were
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
important at that time are worth taking
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
a look at now so that's one of the
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
issues that i'm hearing about this the
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
other is that
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
they are hoping that the state will look
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
at the idea that
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
aesthetics should not be trumped
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the opportunity for
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
a fiscal economy for the chance for
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
clean energy
 
00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:16.950 align:start position:0%
clean energy
so

00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
there's these people are saying that
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
things are different now
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
and that we have many people as you said
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
who are very fixated in this who are
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
saying okay it's a contract it's it's
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
something i have to abide by when we can
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
change contracts and that's what they're
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
asking for but again it's enabling it's
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
not a guarantee
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
so if this bill goes forward of the city
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
of manchester for instance has
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances and things that will make a
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
difference here to our to our
 
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.870 align:start position:0%
difference here to our to our
constituents

00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
so those are the primary points here
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
there are many people who care about
 
00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.109 align:start position:0%
there are many people who care about
this

00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
right now they have a two-thirds bar
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
to get permission and their homeowners
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
associations to make this happen
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh many homeowners associations include
 
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
renters and people that that own blocks
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
of homeowners of homeowners uh units
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
and therefore the two-thirds hurdle is
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
very difficult to to uh
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
to reach also the snowbirds
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
who don't particularly care about having
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of interest whatsoever so
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
there are there are distinct reasons
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
here why the individual is looking for
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
an individual right that has not been
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
accorded because the documents came so
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
far back in the past the documents
 
00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.870 align:start position:0%
far back in the past the documents
are

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
worth taking a look at now and that's
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
what we're doing with this bill
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative mclaren
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
well it would seem to me whether we had
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
this bill or not that somebody in a
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
condo association could go to the
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
association and simply say let's amend
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
the agreement let's get to modern times
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
and this law would have no effect on no
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
need for this law
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
no need for this law
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
but the bar is two-thirds no it well
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
if everybody everybody in the community
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
thinks it's a great idea
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
you know there is no bar
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's no bar that everybody's agreed
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes let's do it and we've heard
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that people don't attend the
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
annual meetings that they don't that
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
they don't vote this just opens the door
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
for people to to do something on
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
property that they own now this is not a
 
01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.870 align:start position:0%
property that they own now this is not a
condo

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
condo
 
01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
we had some concerns about condo versus
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
homeowners association this is not a
 
01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.230 align:start position:0%
homeowners association this is not a
condo

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
condo
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
if if the homeowners association owner
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
wishes to have something on his roof
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's his ownership he owns that he
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
owns the lot as well he or she i should
 
01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:27.270 align:start position:0%
owns the lot as well he or she i should
be

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
careful with my pronouns here but he or
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
she owns that lot and that roof
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
and now there are the things were
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
different in the last 30 or 40 years
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
since those documents were
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
were crafted so the the premise here and
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
again obviously if it's not not
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
something that we're ready to do
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
do here as a state
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
i think it will be something we'll be
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
ready to do in the very near future to
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
allow these things i mean i drove by the
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
gas pump on the way here i paid my
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
my heating bill
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
there are very valid reasons why
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
allowing our citizens the option for
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
more more cost-effective heat and for
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
more cost-effective energy should be on
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
the table and they should see that
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
rationalize it representative abel's
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
next and then represent fargo and then
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative herbert
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
i was going to make the same point
 
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.109 align:start position:0%
i was going to make the same point
as

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
was just made that this is only
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations not condos and
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
that there is there's a quite a bit of
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
legal difference between the two
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
a homeowners association
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
the owner owns the property
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
and owns the
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
owns the building
 
01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.829 align:start position:0%
owns the building
um

01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:43.839 --> 01:01:44.950 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
that there's no universal
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
uh two-thirds half of the members have
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
to agree to this
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of difference among
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
the bylaws and the deed restrictions for
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
for a homeowners association
 
01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:05.750 align:start position:0%
for a homeowners association
and

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
i believe that this is this is a
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
forward-looking thing um
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
and that in fact
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
many people who live in homeowners
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
associations rue the fact that when the
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
buildings when the houses were
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
originally built
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
builder didn't make them all
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
be solar powered
 
01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.270 align:start position:0%
be solar powered
and

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
whether whether we want to act on this
 
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
or not i think is is
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
is a useful debate
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't see any anything in here
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
that would would change any would change
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
anything i i would
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
i can't see where
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh there why there's any reason not to
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
not to support you if the homeowners
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
association has written in their
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
agreement that everybody bought who
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
bought it signed
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
and agreed to
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
says there would be no exterior changes
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
to your
 
01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.069 align:start position:0%
to your
house

01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
without permission from the homeowners
 
01:03:10.799 --> 01:03:12.470 align:start position:0%
without permission from the homeowners
association

01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
you don't see this bill basically
 
01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:16.710 align:start position:0%
you don't see this bill basically
trumping

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
trumping
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'd have to think about that and that
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
was crafted many decades ago
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
i've never seen to be frankly with you i
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
have never seen a homeowners association
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
agreement that doesn't have deed
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions oh absolutely i agree yeah
 
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.069 align:start position:0%
restrictions oh absolutely i agree yeah
okay

01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
and all we're saying here is
 
01:03:42.559 --> 01:03:43.349 align:start position:0%
and all we're saying here is
that

01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
if it had any deed restriction that
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
would somehow
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
we're saying is
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
and it just it just turns it back to the
 
01:03:58.799 --> 01:04:01.029 align:start position:0%
and it just it just turns it back to the
locality

01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
locality
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative herbert
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's the question i have um
 
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
that's that's the question i have um
uh

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
i'm i thought i heard the sponsor say
 
01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
i'm i thought i heard the sponsor say
that

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
some of these documents are are so
 
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.990 align:start position:0%
some of these documents are are so
outdated

01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
outdated
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
that i kind of got the impression that
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
they said you had to use gas or you had
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
to use
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
some particular type of
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
energy in order to
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
heat your
 
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.789 align:start position:0%
heat your
home

01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
is that the case in some of these pardon
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
me we're just talking about external
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
fixtures really here
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
the heating system so it is not the case
 
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:37.910 align:start position:0%
the heating system so it is not the case
that

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
some of the documents would uh prohibit
 
01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:43.349 align:start position:0%
some of the documents would uh prohibit
solar

01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
um as
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
the chair said documents differ
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
it could have been to association so
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
there could have been an association
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
that specifically says
 
01:04:55.039 --> 01:04:56.950 align:start position:0%
that specifically says
um

01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a frank now i did my
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners association in 1982.
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that's considered old
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
or young
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
but in my our original agreement we
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
wrote into it that everyone was supposed
 
01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.109 align:start position:0%
wrote into it that everyone was supposed
to

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
not use fossil fuels as a primary
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
heating system
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
and that the houses should all be just
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be solar homes
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
that's what i wrote way back then i was
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
young i was in my 20s
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
by the time i got to my 30s the
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
homeowners association decided they this
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
was problematic
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
and they did remove the exclude that
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
they could not use fossil fuels as
 
01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:41.750 align:start position:0%
they could not use fossil fuels as
exclusive

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
exclusive
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
but they made the choice they didn't
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
want oil trucks
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
so they said that you could use
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
natural gas propane as your
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
primary heating system that was and we
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
uniformly 100 percent
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to worry about the 230 we
 
01:05:58.559 --> 01:05:59.589 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to worry about the 230 we
100

01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
100
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
uniformly agreed to that homeowner's
 
01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:03.670 align:start position:0%
uniformly agreed to that homeowner's
change

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
representative greason
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
if the state has established that
 
01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.589 align:start position:0%
if the state has established that
two-thirds

01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
is what a homeowners association
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
majority must be
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
then could the state say to each
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners association we truly want to
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
make this enabling could we go out to
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
the homeowners associations and say you
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
can establish your own majority as long
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
as it's not doesn't exceed two-thirds
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
and then you can make whatever
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
any homeowners association can do
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
whatever they want
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
with whatever majority they decide to
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
establish they just have to tell the
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
state what that majority is going to be
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
so if there's any questions
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
the state now knows hey you said it had
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
to be 60 you said it had to be 51 you
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
said it had to be whatever and they
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
could be held to that standard but if we
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
want to make it enabling
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
then say if you want to change your
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
standard on what a majority is you can
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
do that but we're not going to tell you
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
what you have to do
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting concept i would
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
just point out that we just voted down
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
the previous bill is to change the uh of
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
the home the association's
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
voting authority to approve a budget and
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
say we want to keep the current law in
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
its current form so i would be a little
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
careful with that i would say that um
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
many many many moons ago and i don't
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
think there's i don't know how many
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
people in the room were around when i
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
was around this actually was a hot issue
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
up in brenton woods when the developer
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
and there is you could have you had 10
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
years to develop out the houses and it
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get developed and the homeowners
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
association wouldn't refuse to give him
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
permission to fill up fill out the
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
development and it was a and and back
 
01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:48.870 align:start position:0%
development and it was a and and back
then

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
back then
 
01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.589 align:start position:0%
back then
the

01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
said in no uncertain terms
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
that the state should not be
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
getting involved indeed you know these
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
arguments should not be involved in this
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
at all that these are absolute property
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
rights now you all hear about how
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes when there's property needs to
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
be done and you've got to go find
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
distant cousins or any relative anybody
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
who could have had some connection that
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
it and that was a hundred percent there
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
was no 80. and we lowered it to 80 we
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
end up doing it to 80 we end up lowering
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
the number but i'm just saying that this
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
is a very sensitive issue because people
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
who sign that deed
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
expect deed restrictions to be held up
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative weston yeah thank you um
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
i think that a lot of the testimony was
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
about the visual aspect of having solar
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
panels on the houses and i understand
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
that that a lot of people don't like the
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
way they look
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
but uh shingles are being developed now
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
that have
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
the that same capability and i think the
 
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.470 align:start position:0%
the that same capability and i think the
whole

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
argument is going to change considerably
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
as soon as we have those shingles
 
01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
as soon as we have those shingles
available

01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
they'll look just like any other roof
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
yeah hopefully i've always wondered
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
about you know the steel roofs
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
and why we can't somehow when that sun
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
is out and hitting that steel and it's
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
really warming up that steel that we
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
can't capture that energy somehow and
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
i've always wondered who somebody should
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
be working on that technology
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
01:09:24.239 --> 01:09:25.030 align:start position:0%
yes yes
yes

01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
just one last point um
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
the last constituent to whom i spoke
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
is in favor and brought up the point
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
that the last thing that she would want
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
is to deny her neighbor the opportunity
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
to save money and to have clean energy
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
for how something looks
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
and she reported to me that there was a
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
an ungodly piece of artwork that is on
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
the porch
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
of the neighbor next door
 
01:09:53.199 --> 01:09:54.470 align:start position:0%
of the neighbor next door
and

01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
the issue of aesthetics really is not as
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
strong as the issue of
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
healthy clean living and clean air and
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
clean heat and so her point is i will
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
live with the ungodly artwork next door
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
but i will really want to make sure that
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
that person who wants to have better
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
heating and better energy has that
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so so just just to
 
01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.430 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so so just just to
clarify

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
the kinds of input that i've been
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
getting and by the way i am not in a
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
homeowner's association there has not
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
been clarity about that uh i live in a
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
condo association
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i cannot have solar energy i would
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
love to have it but that's not an option
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
to me because of the structure that i've
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
chosen to live in the building can't
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
really handle it
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
so represent him
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
i feel
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
fairly strongly on both sides of this
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
issue um
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
knowing a bit about it and understanding
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
there is a public interest here to
 
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.590 align:start position:0%
there is a public interest here to
encourage

01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
homeowners to take advantage of
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
things that have a public good or a
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
public benefit
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
associations that have been around a
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
and perhaps the state of the art
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
was different when they were formed
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
and why uh to require
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh folks that are building new in in the
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
development another phase of it need to
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
um stick with a standard that was uh the
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
standard uh in in 1980 or or 2010 with
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
with all the standards changing so
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
so uh quickly and dramatically
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh in construction in
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
heating sources and and and
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
all the basic
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh aspects of building
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if we have another
 
01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.910 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if we have another
choice

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
to do with this bill something else we
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
can do with this bill not kill it not
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
because i think myself i feel
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
about equally strongly on both sides of
 
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
this issue wanting to maintain that's
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
why you buy into an association
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
you want to guarantee that the community
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
is going to look
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
pretty much as you
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
chose to buy into
 
01:12:16.719 --> 01:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
chose to buy into
versus

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to take advantage of
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
changes in technology and changes in
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
standards over time and not be
 
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.350 align:start position:0%
standards over time and not be
stuck

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
stuck
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
building a
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
chalet style
 
01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.270 align:start position:0%
chalet style
or

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
or putting in
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
a type of energy source that is no
 
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.350 align:start position:0%
a type of energy source that is no
longer

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
in vogue so i feel strongly this still
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
does not address any new
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
projects going forward but
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
and i would i would say i would venture
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
to say i would be very surprised of
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
anybody who was going forward with a a
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
new homeowners association
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't actually want to have pvs and
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be urging people to do it
 
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
because i'm sure the contractor would
 
01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.430 align:start position:0%
because i'm sure the contractor would
love

01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
love
 
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.630 align:start position:0%
love
to

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
charge that extra onto that building and
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
putting it up so i can't imagine going
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
forward any new project this is only for
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
ones that are already built and fully
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
built out and fully built up any empty
 
01:13:15.679 --> 01:13:17.189 align:start position:0%
built out and fully built up any empty
lots

01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
lots
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
like i said empty lots would be the
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
developer can when he sells the deed
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
he can then write whatever he wants in
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
in that deed and certainly i'm sure they
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
would make permission for photovoltaics
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
um well further in that case they know
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
what they're buying they know exactly
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
what they're buying correct exactly what
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
the community looks like exactly what
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
what they're getting and what they're
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
so you okay with killing this bill um
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
if that is the case then it only applies
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
to existing situations and you know
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
exactly that you're buying
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
um something that's
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
does not have pvs and doesn't allow it
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
because the because there's some stick
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the muds in that community won't
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
change the rules and they have the
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to their um
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
in that case if it if it if it does not
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
cover anybody
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh um they know what they're getting
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
they know what they're buying they're
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
not buying a lot and uh
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
having to
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
be in unable to take advantage of new
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
technology then i guess
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
i tell it okay great
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative johnson seconds by
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
representing him moves in extreme to
 
01:14:42.719 --> 01:14:43.910 align:start position:0%
representing him moves in extreme to
legislate

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
any discussion representative bartlett
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm i'm sort of in
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
the same position that representative
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
we built a homeowner's association in 92
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
um here in in concord up at mountain
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
green and
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
it was 25 a year to put flowers by the
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
front entrance that was really the only
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
thing we contributed to
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
i remember that we weren't allowed to
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
hang clothes where anybody could see
 
01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
hang clothes where anybody could see
them

01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.229 align:start position:0%
them
well

01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
we have our dryer is manufactured in
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
1968. i've never used it my kids used to
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
come home from college and use it so we
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
always hang our clothes but they weren't
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
where anybody could see them
 
01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:25.669 align:start position:0%
where anybody could see them
um

01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
we moved
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
after the kids left we need a big house
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
so we um built up um up the road a bit
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then a new con new homeowners
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
association went in
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
on sanborn road very nice association
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
that was really different though
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
they only own even though they have
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
beautiful homes and they start around
 
01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.790 align:start position:0%
beautiful homes and they start around
500

01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
500
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
they only own six feet out from the
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
foundation the rest of it is common area
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
where the other homeowners association
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
you know we had
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
between three quarters and two acres per
 
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
lot right um so i started so when this
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
bill came up i had to start thinking
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
i would like to see this
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
i really think
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
that there are different kinds of
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations out there with
 
01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations out there with
different

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
ideas of how
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
how solar could be incorporated
 
01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
how solar could be incorporated
and

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
as we heard just yesterday
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
the under reporting and underestimating
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
by our government of where we are
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
um regard of all governments just not
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
our government but all governments of
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
where we are as far as how we reduce our
 
01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:44.070 align:start position:0%
where we are as far as how we reduce our
our

01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
reliance on fossil fuel is is
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
much lower than what it really is
 
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.750 align:start position:0%
much lower than what it really is
um

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
than what's being reported
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
we have got to make some difficult
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
decisions about how we reduce
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
our reliance on fossil fuel and that
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
means everybody so i would like to see
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
those of us that are
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
on the fence about this
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
i mean and what are you going to get
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
with an interim study i mean at the end
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
it's the question is are you going to
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
force homeowners associations except
 
01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.830 align:start position:0%
force homeowners associations except
something

01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
that evidently some members of that
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
homeowner association don't want to
 
01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.470 align:start position:0%
homeowner association don't want to
accept

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.430 align:start position:0%
accept
that's

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
to me that's the policy to build forget
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
about the solar i mean they could be
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
something even
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
even better than solar out there okay
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
that we would all sit there and say why
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
what is wrong with that person that they
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to agree to that the idea
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
that this committee could vote as
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
interim study as a recommendation means
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
subject can continue to be discussed and
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's a different message than
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
just killing it and saying nope we're
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
not going to do anything
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have interim study as
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
an option
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so i would like to see us be able to
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
consider that
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
yes connie i i just like to respond to
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
what you said and i do understand your
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
point of view i understand all the
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
points of view because
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
this is a complex issue uh even though
 
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.070 align:start position:0%
this is a complex issue uh even though
it

01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
at its heart and soul
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
it isn't
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking at it from the point of
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
view that we are forcing the
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
associations to accept something that
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
they don't want
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
and my constituents are asking me to
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
come to you and say
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have you look at the rights
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
of the individual
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
the the individual homeowner who's paid
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
the mortgage who's paid the the bills
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
who owns the building
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
to look at those rights instead so just
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
to give you the other side of the
 
01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.430 align:start position:0%
to give you the other side of the
viewpoint

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
viewpoint
 
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.550 align:start position:0%
viewpoint
so

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
what you really want us is to
 
01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.229 align:start position:0%
what you really want us is to
urge

01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
urge
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
new future homeowners associations
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
well that's true that's not the spell
 
01:18:58.239 --> 01:19:01.350 align:start position:0%
well that's true that's not the spell
but

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think christie's viewpoint is well i'm
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
trying to spin this how we're going to
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
rationalize why we would keep this bill
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
alive we're that somehow to urge
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations to be nice to
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
their neighbors and do something for
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
them and and let them you know save
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
energy and that that how how could that
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
be for the greater good of all of us
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
if they just put pvp and i know that
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
interim study is a is a gentle kill yeah
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
generally okay we're a second year i
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
mean let's get real about this a second
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
but i still think we can send a message
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
you know as a committee that says okay
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
it is a complex issue
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
it is worth
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
continuing a discussion
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
we in commerce do feel that
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
solar voltaic cells are something that's
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
happening in the future hopefully i get
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
so how do the
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
republicans feel about that mr speaker
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
as a former nuclear reactor operator
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
i am very much in support of nuclear
 
01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.070 align:start position:0%
i am very much in support of nuclear
energy

01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
oh should we talk everybody should have
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
i started working on a pigeon several
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
how each individual home could have its
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
own little reactor to generate
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
centuries worth of
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
free electricity and i'm not joking
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
nuclear i'm very much in support of
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy and we need to pursue
 
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.270 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy and we need to pursue
that

01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
every bit as much as we pursue anything
 
01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:35.750 align:start position:0%
every bit as much as we pursue anything
else

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
representation thank you mr chair
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
i look at the
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners association as a private
 
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.270 align:start position:0%
homeowners association as a private
business

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
pub pub semi-private business owned by a
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
group of stockholders who are the
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
homeowners and is not the job of this
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
committee to mandate anything to a
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
private business
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
in this way thank you mr chair okay
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
motion is inexpensive to legislate and i
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
think we've discussed this enough um all
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
those in favor of uh anything to
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
legislate raise your hands
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
one two three
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
four five
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
and those opposed oh wait excuse me
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.709 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
just

just
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
and all all opposed
 
01:21:27.679 --> 01:21:28.550 align:start position:0%

three
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
i got herbert
 
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.390 align:start position:0%
i got herbert
abel

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
abel
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
yeah fargo you're
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and fire goes on
 
01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
yeah and fire goes on
okay

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
because it because how many numbers that
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
i came out i have one two three four
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight nine
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
so what somebody you couldn't vote
 
01:21:52.719 --> 01:21:58.470 align:start position:0%
so what somebody you couldn't vote
no

01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
john may i just say that i do appreciate
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
the um the input and the and the the
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
good dialogue that we had here
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
obviously it didn't go in the direction
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
that i wanted from my constituents and
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh but i think we are putting us back on
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
the radar and thinking about it and
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's part of what we do here so thank
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
you very much okay good i'm glad you
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
feel like you got a fair hearing and
 
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.590 align:start position:0%
feel like you got a fair hearing and
then

01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
so good
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
um
1378

01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
1378
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
that was standing in the the fundamental
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
you know having getting a warrant for
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
this and then the the sponsor came up
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
with this amendment that had some
 
01:22:57.199 --> 01:22:58.070 align:start position:0%
with this amendment that had some
uh

01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
there was some limitations of when the
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
warrant whatever was necessary
 
01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.350 align:start position:0%
warrant whatever was necessary
um

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
i guess i couldn't get beyond the
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
language of the the actual law that just
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
and so i my preference would be to
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
interim study this bill so that at least
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
can get clean up the statute
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
and and see if there were some
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
parameters that
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know requiring a warrant was was
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
um but at this point i'm not
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
overly excited about taking that issue
 
01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:30.870 align:start position:0%
overly excited about taking that issue
on

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
and how does everybody else feel i agree
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
the only concern i had was making sure
 
01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.229 align:start position:0%
the only concern i had was making sure
that

01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
going for i agree with with interim
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
studying this and because of the
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
age of this
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
of the current statute uh it needs an
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
overhaul need to totally work going
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
forward there does need to be
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
some statement
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
to the effect of a warrant would be
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
necessary to compel compliance i totally
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
agree with the idea of
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and the innkeeper would
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
have the ability to comply at their will
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
but when you talk about
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
compelling compliance
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
being in the vacation rental business i
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't even know where i would begin
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
because we have no idea who's in the
 
01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.110 align:start position:0%
because we have no idea who's in the
house

01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know we don't i know there's some
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
vacations i know where one time we
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
rented a property
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think it was in colorado and they and
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
they expected us to tell every name of
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
every person that's in the house
 
01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.350 align:start position:0%
every person that's in the house
and

01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
frankly i really didn't i think they
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
were their
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
goddamn business
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
knowing what my grandchildren's names
 
01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.350 align:start position:0%
knowing what my grandchildren's names
were

01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know like is how offensive that was
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
that i'm supposed to let them know who's
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
who's there and you know you all you
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
need is one name the o the person who
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
was renting
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
i i could understand any adult the names
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
of any adults
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
that are going to be on the property
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
having that information um
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes i don't i to me this brought up so
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
many cans of worms that i it's it's
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
really awkward in terms of that
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement ability issue you know i
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
mean i grant you that if
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
in my case
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
if a
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement showed up at the house
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
and said i want to know who's renting
 
01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.470 align:start position:0%
and said i want to know who's renting
just

01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
well it's the only people there is the
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
wretches right
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
and that's when you can say that's none
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
of your business
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
why do you want to know i mean if they
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
come in and say is john doe staying here
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
if as a law abiding citizen interested
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
in in law enforcement trying to catch
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
the bad guys which we all want you could
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
say oh yes sir i have a john doe named
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
here or that's listed as staying here
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
and then is he nobody's i'm not even
 
01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
and then is he nobody's i'm not even
there

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i could be out of state i could
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
be down in my summer home in rhode
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
island when they show up to the house in
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
and say i mean this is not anybody paid
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
enough attention to what's going on i
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
know i know up in jackson there's a lot
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
of people watching reading about it
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
because it was in the newspapers on the
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
conway paper here almost every day
 
01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.790 align:start position:0%
conway paper here almost every day
about

01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
these rentals but you know the issue is
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
whoever owns the property
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
that is renting it out
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
should have
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
should know who's staying there if you
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't know who's staying there then
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness somebody tears up your
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
place how do you hold them accountable i
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
have i have a 775 deposit well that may
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
not cover much of anything
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
but my point is
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
is we're looking at this this is totally
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
from a law enforcement standpoint
 
01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.910 align:start position:0%
from a law enforcement standpoint
okay

01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
you should know who's staying on your
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
property if you don't care well that's
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
your business uh kind of reckless to me
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
but i want to know who's staying in my
 
01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.030 align:start position:0%
but i want to know who's staying in my
home

01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
any adults that come in and stay in my
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
home i want to know who they are
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
so having that information
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
is is my purview
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
now if the law enforcement comes along
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
and says mr greeson
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
who is staying in your home
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
i have the right to say none of your
 
01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.270 align:start position:0%
i have the right to say none of your
business

01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
but i also have the right to say
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
well who are you looking for and why
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
and if i feel like i want to answer the
 
01:27:22.239 --> 01:27:23.189 align:start position:0%
and if i feel like i want to answer the
question

01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
i can answer the question if they say
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
specific names i can say yes or no but
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
to compel my compliance you better have
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
a warrant if you want to come and search
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
the property you better have a warrant
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
so you know we're looking they're not
 
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
searching the property they're just
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're just wanna they want to see
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
if the name they're a person they're
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
is registered and ready and anybody
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
who's who's not a trying to harbor
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
criminals is going to be like yeah this
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
guy's staying here go get him get him
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
off my property
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
so so i i i'm just saying that having a
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
list of names is not an unreasonable
 
01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.550 align:start position:0%
list of names is not an unreasonable
thing

01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
but you don't have to you don't have to
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.390 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
unless they have a warrant in which that
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
compels you to comply
 
01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.830 align:start position:0%
compels you to comply
okay

01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i hear you i i think that the
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
warrant is going to be a problem but
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
i think at least we need to rewrite the
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
statute and let's see how we can
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
get there but
 
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.390 align:start position:0%
get there but
um

01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i the warrant might be
 
01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:27.189 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i the warrant might be
problematic

01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
but but anyways
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
let's see what let's see when we just
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
study what the study come up he comes up
 
01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.149 align:start position:0%
study what the study come up he comes up
with

01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.870 align:start position:0%
okay yes
rich

01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
rich
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes thanks um
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
i thought that
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
when we had the hearing
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
representatives of law enforcement made
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
case for
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
for why this is helpful to them and i
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
didn't completely understand
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh the proponents
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
of this bill and
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
i thought that was a weaker presentation
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
but it also seems to me that that
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
this really ought to go to to uh
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
public safety i wish we could just refer
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
to them and let them figure it out a
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
different yeah um but i guess we can't
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
do that so we have to we have to we have
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
to we
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
can't we can't okay all right so it's
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's our responsibility all right so i i
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
i think i think it actually should be
 
01:29:28.239 --> 01:29:29.910 align:start position:0%
i think i think it actually should be
itled

01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
itled
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
but that's my opinion
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
represent bartlett i feel the same way i
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
mean i can support the interim study but
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
i just soon see it killed
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i i
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
to me that we got to clean up the
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
statute i can't let it let that sit
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
there like that you know
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
so representative fargo
 
01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.950 align:start position:0%
so representative fargo
um

01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
i i think there were two things that
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
concerned me uh when we were we were
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
hearing from the law enforcement people
 
01:29:58.159 --> 01:29:58.950 align:start position:0%
hearing from the law enforcement people
um

01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
because it takes eight to 48 hours to
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
get a warrant which could impede their
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
ability to prevent a crime but it also
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
if they needed to identify victims in
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
the case of
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
something happening um
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
that that would be a problem as well so
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
i think the bill is it stands as pretty
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
flawed i'd like to i agree that probably
 
01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:22.550 align:start position:0%
flawed i'd like to i agree that probably
this

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
the statute or whatever should be
 
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
rewritten but this particular bill i i
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
i would like to see it in expedient to
 
01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.350 align:start position:0%
i would like to see it in expedient to
legislate

01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.510 align:start position:0%
legislate
okay

01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
there are there are such things as
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
exigent circumstances and probable cause
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
things that law enforcement officers
 
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.910 align:start position:0%
things that law enforcement officers
understand

01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
as to when and how they can enter
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
property and what things they can and
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
cannot do again if it if it's a matter
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's a completely different matter if
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
there's a crime in progress or if a
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
criminal has left the scene and entered
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
it that that that that establishment
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's completely different from going
 
01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:01.030 align:start position:0%
that's completely different from going
in

01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
and saying is john doe staying here
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
and that's the way this was presented
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
and so do you have a list of the of the
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the occupants of this establishment
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
and the innkeeper
 
01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.390 align:start position:0%
and the innkeeper
can

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.510 align:start position:0%
can
say

01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
what we're getting down to is compelling
 
01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.229 align:start position:0%
what we're getting down to is compelling
compliance

01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
and it has nothing to do with leave it
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
up to the innkeeper to decide what's
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
that leave it up to the innkeeper to
 
01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.629 align:start position:0%
that leave it up to the innkeeper to
decide

01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
well the innkeeper can say can answer
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions or they can refuse to answer
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
questions but in order to compel
 
01:31:45.679 --> 01:31:46.950 align:start position:0%
questions but in order to compel
compliance

01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we i watched uh french kiss uh
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
this weekend
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
one of my wife's favorite movies with
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
nick ryan and and the and the and the
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
concierge said i um
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
no i can't you know in terms of whether
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
he was still
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
there at the hotel so i guess there is
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
something to be said that it should be
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
the innkeepers rights to uh
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
decide whether they really want to share
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
it and and
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
i know that you guys probably won't
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
agree with that but
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
a compelling you know because it could
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
be an awkward situation because you're
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the person's computer
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying i want you know how does
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
that part how does the land keeper have
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
a right but
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll discuss this
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
come come september we'll have this
 
01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
come come september we'll have this
conversation

01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
well i think we know your position
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
you're you're you would be opposed
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
you're you're adamantly you would like
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
to see this bill die a quick death i
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
know i get that
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
so represent here
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um i i agree with the interim
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
study because i see there is a balance
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
here between
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
public safety and and the rights to
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
expect privacy
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
um and so i think in from study i think
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
we need to think carefully
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
where that line is between your
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy when you rent
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
something versus concerned for
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
safety for for other folks safety so i
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
would agree with the interim
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
study right
 
01:33:24.639 --> 01:33:26.149 align:start position:0%
study right
okay

01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
all right so uh representative mclean
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'll let you vote on this one since i
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay um all those in favor of interim
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.159 --> 01:33:43.189 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%

those opposed
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
you moved unanimously
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.119 --> 01:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.790 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
relative to privacy of online consumer
 
01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:37.350 align:start position:0%
relative to privacy of online consumer
customer

01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
that's information so
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
it seems like a lot of states are
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
playing with a lot of different ideas
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
with this and
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that we should interim
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
study it just just we want to we want to
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
pay attention to what's going on in
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
other states and see what's happening
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
my concern is that some states might be
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
passing it and no one actually
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
uses the statute that it just sits there
 
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
and and uh that
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
if you guys know me that that's an
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
anathema for the way i do business i i i
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we actually pass
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
something that solves the problem
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
the right of private action of people
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
trying to sue verizon or sue their
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
income that jim seems like a nightmare i
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
just don't know how
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is ever going to work the right
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
private action you know you really had
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
you got to have something that you could
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
give the at the attorney general
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
something to work with but yeah
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
representing if you if you enter and
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
study this do you have any idea which
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
direction you're going to go to make it
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
into a workable bill i my attitude would
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
be is just to collect information what's
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
going on all these different states
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
and the case laws of what's going on in
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
those states and seeing what what's
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
really happening but you don't have any
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
legislation i i really have no clue on
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
how to handle this i really don't
 
01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.310 align:start position:0%
how to handle this i really don't
um

01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
um i i don't do facebook
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
because i just there's no way i could
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
ever feel
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
safe with wasted facebook you know
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
just you know you never know who's there
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
who's connecting and you and then you
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
look at this you know they keep changing
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
the long list of things you can check in
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
and get in and out like oh my god this
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
is i thought your comment
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
that gentleman was here about yep you're
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
officially a nerd i mean he was just
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
talking over oh yeah he was definitely
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
talking about in terms of how
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah as someone of a nerd i guess
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
um the truth is if you really understand
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
the technology these broadband providers
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
they can't even they don't even access
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
your debt your data they're picking up
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
packets and moving them that's all
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing right they're the mailman
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
they're yeah yeah ask the mailman what's
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
in my in my mail
 
01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:54.629 align:start position:0%
in my in my mail
and

01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
screen my mail is you know and there was
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
a good internet
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
supposedly right and the other concern i
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
had was enforcement and and i think the
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office had quite a
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
bit to say about this as well
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
and you know i if if nothing else i
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
think that whole piece of it needed to
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
be revisited that
 
01:39:14.719 --> 01:39:16.229 align:start position:0%
be revisited that
um

01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:17.590 --> 01:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
and not that i want to pick a fight but
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
you remember for those of us have been
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
we've had this issue several times and
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
we've struggled with it
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
right in this case it was right
 
01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.470 align:start position:0%
right in this case it was right
and

01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i in
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
my in my mind is let's let's be sure we
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
can you know
 
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
we really think what we're doing is
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to address
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then why don't we itl
 
01:39:44.239 --> 01:39:45.430 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then why don't we itl
it

01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
yeah which is what we did to the last
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
version i agree
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
you want to just kill it no yeah you
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
guys how do you guys feel about just
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
i think this problem
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
is much bigger than these three pages
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
there's a real concern about our about
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
our information and
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
it is it is a commodity and people are
 
01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.709 align:start position:0%
it is it is a commodity and people are
multi-multi-billionaires

01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
multi-multi-billionaires
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
just just just off of our information so
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
how do they get the information if we
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
don't volunteer it now when you sign up
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
for facebook or anything else you're
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
volunteering a lot of information
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
and then when you conduct commerce
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
online they have your information
 
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
and then of course we have data breaches
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
that we always hear about
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know years after it's been oh hey
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
somebody had the names of like
 
01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.109 align:start position:0%
somebody had the names of like
even

01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
even department of defense and social
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
security have had data breaches uh and
 
01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.149 align:start position:0%
security have had data breaches uh and
so

01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:44.159 --> 01:40:45.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
personal defense personal records uh
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know how
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
the internet service provider
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh how we can even regulate them in in
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
knowing whether or not they're
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
they are the ones now i believe they
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
certainly have the ability to track all
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
of your
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh all of your activity there's no
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
question that they have that capacity
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
they have right they could get it if
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
they wanted to whether or not they do or
 
01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.790 align:start position:0%
they wanted to whether or not they do or
don't

01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they do
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
um but i just don't know how in the
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
world we could even begin to
 
01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:22.390 align:start position:0%
world we could even begin to
uh

01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
to regulate this yeah well you really
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
hit the nail on the head when you say is
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
even though
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
and and i remember talking to this guy
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
who when i
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
before we had fiber come to the house we
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
we actually had this guy did shortwave
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
you know and he said to me that known
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
certain terms said yes it is he is
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
capable for him to see
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
what's going back and forth
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
if it was un
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
unencrypted if it's encrypted he can't
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
see it but if it was unencrypted and and
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
let's face a lot of stuff we do we we
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't we don't pay attention to every
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
web page and see if it's encrypted
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
before we load it up so um
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
but he said you know there's
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
he would never do that because it just
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
has a business policy why would you ever
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
want to do that
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
but more importantly is
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
how would you be able to prove
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
that that data that that information it
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
was them who did it
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
that's the thing i mean it's how you're
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
gonna how are we gonna have to prove
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
who's the one who actually was the
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
league viewers are advancing so so
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
rapidly now with with quantum computing
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh that basically there will be no
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
encryption of anything because as soon
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
as you can encrypt it you can decrypt it
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
at the speed of light that's what
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
quantum quantum computing is all about
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
i'm studying this back within my
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree
 
01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:43.510 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree
so

01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh it's a real threat and it's really
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
starting to happen so so is it worth
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
interim study or just kill this bill and
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
let's wait let's wait the next session
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
i have a minor in physics i still have
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
six more hours to get the degrees okay
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's way beyond my head yeah represent
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
him i i agree
 
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
i have a master's in business and this
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
is way beyond
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
me or us i think to come up with
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
something you know we can study it and
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
try to understand it but i don't know
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
what we're going to come up with
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
so i would be okay with itl it because i
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
don't know what we'd come up with okay
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative weston seconded by
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative ham moves in expedient to
 
01:43:35.199 --> 01:43:36.950 align:start position:0%
representative ham moves in expedient to
legislate

01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay last but not least
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
requiring warning labels and consumer
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
advertising containing
 
01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:13.990 align:start position:0%
advertising containing
pfas

01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
represent but i'm not going to make a
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
motion but i have been doing a lot of
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
research over the last
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
a couple months about
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
actually over the last four years about
 
01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.270 align:start position:0%
actually over the last four years about
pfas

01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
this bill um i i do know that uh the
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
state of california and maine have
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
passed bills regarding pfas
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
one of them is labeling the other one is
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
the one in california is banning pfas in
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
juvenile products
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of um
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
there are some states that
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
um studying this and have moved forward
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
and the governors have signed bills
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
regarding pfas um
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
this bill really is not ready for prime
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
time that's for sure interim study you
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
know we're not studying warning labels i
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
think we're studying how to move forward
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
with educating
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
people on pfas and not only that the
 
01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:11.189 align:start position:0%
people on pfas and not only that the
sludge

01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
sludge
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
now that's spread on farmlands
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
has contaminated many farms um that we
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
know in maine so there's a big problem
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
with pfas so i'm not sure if interim
 
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
study is the way to go with this bill um
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
we can certainly you know move forward
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
next year i'll be here next year well we
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
did pass one study committee already on
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
pfas right it's um uh bill boyd's yeah
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
boys right
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
right so so we can just roll that into
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm saying it really
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
includes that
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
so we could itl this one
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
the thing that struck me
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
was the
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
dumping of
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
contaminated material
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire dumps
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
and and i you know i would be all about
 
01:46:01.590 --> 01:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
saying you can't do that but
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
you just
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know but i mean if
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's against the law and somebody and
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
somebody measures it then they've broken
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
the law i mean i wasn't gonna do it no
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
no i don't know how to do it right but
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
to me that was for my yeah because i saw
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
the stuff here it's in everything you
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
know right so you don't know what's you
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
dump the dish you know the washing
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
machine you don't know that the rubber
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
ring had pfas in it yep right but
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
just as an observation uh the the
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
business about taking it from mass and
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
dumping it in manchester right that's
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
huge too is is to me uh something that i
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
i definitely would go after if we could
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
yeah solid waste is a big problem yes
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative yeah i'm i'm actually
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
encouraged by the education that's going
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
on about this issue and a couple of
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
um originators of pfas up north have
 
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
changed their tune and one is ski wax
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
you cannot find fluoridated ski wax
 
01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:01.109 align:start position:0%
you cannot find fluoridated ski wax
anymore

01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the second is car washes
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
the local i work with a guy up in the
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
canon advisory commission whose business
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
is car wash and they're getting away
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
from putting pfas in the wax that you
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
use simoniz hot wax doesn't have it
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
because the word is getting out to stop
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
it at the source and i really think
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's where we have to put our energies
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
but i like the idea of the study
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
committee because that'll just keep the
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
questions well we have that study
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
committee already we already had that
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
study committee already what bill boyd's
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh bill is
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
interim study okay
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
yeah we kept we kept that so we have
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
something to keep the conversation
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
but it's interesting about the wax
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
because when um we bought our new volvo
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh they sold us on this um glycol
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
there's some surface they put over it
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to mean that we don't
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
need the wax so they were supposed to
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
say no act but i had at the time i said
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
i wonder if it's got pretty fast is that
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
what they're doing putting a p-pass coat
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
over the
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
i will say our car is taking it's it's
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's amazing how well
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's taking the the you know you know it
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
you have to worry about that right i
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't know my daughter upgraded her
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
prius and she's got this flashy red lead
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know it just
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
so just another comment about chemicals
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
and bpas
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
there was you know study commissions
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
committees uh and now bpa is banned in
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know most products in the united
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
states you can't add people that's where
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
the water or the kids baby
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
the baby bottle issue came out right so
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
we did regulate that so there is you
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
know precedent um and so
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we can kill this because we have an
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
interim study i'd love to be on the
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
right we have an internship well it's
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
not a study committee we have we have we
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
have his as an interim study so that we
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
can we can free to think about any and
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
take it anywhere we want to go with it
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
so we can we can meet in the in the fall
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
that would meet in the fall i'll work on
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
this yep okay i'd like to bring you know
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
i'll do a lot of research and
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
um with the other bills that have passed
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
in other states and i think we really
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
need to do something about it
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's definitely up and coming um so
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
but we can kill this one we can kill
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
this one if everybody's okay with that
 
01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.790 align:start position:0%
this one if everybody's okay with that
representative

01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
we do have that other study committee
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
and in my mind this seems to be more of
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
an environmental
 
01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.229 align:start position:0%
an environmental
scientific

01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
01:49:52.239 --> 01:49:54.310 align:start position:0%
scientific
focus

01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
focus
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
versus commerce focus
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
as to what should have labels and
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
what the um
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
hazards are and so forth so congress i
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
think it should be studied by
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
scientists and environmentalists
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
we had an issue years ago the the bovine
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
growth hormone
 
01:50:18.239 --> 01:50:19.350 align:start position:0%
growth hormone
and

01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
they used to send it to the ag committee
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
and the agriculture committee they just
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
struggled over they just didn't know how
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
to handle it they didn't it was it was
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day you know they'd
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
often it would come to the floor with a
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
split vote you know that they couldn't
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
make up a decision they couldn't and
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
and uh finally they sent the bill to
 
01:50:37.119 --> 01:50:38.390 align:start position:0%
and uh finally they sent the bill to
commerce

01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:39.189 align:start position:0%
commerce
and

01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
and and commerce said no this is this is
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know an issue that absolutely
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
to take it completely opposite rather
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
than telling you whether you had you
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
know that the terms of the grove home
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
they actually started using as a
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
marketing tool
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
to say no we don't
 
01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.030 align:start position:0%
to say no we don't
have

01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
so we didn't need to do it so sometimes
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
the reason you send it to to commerce is
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
because we don't get too bogged down on
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
the science that we talk about what is
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
really going on in the marketplace and
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
what is the right you know how how the
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
market is going to handle a product and
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
and i've always said you know that uh
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know what what is wrong with a
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
business just saying you know and where
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
with a private
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
honor if they want if they think they
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
think bovine grown hormones a good thing
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
then let them advertise that or
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
vice versa if they think it's a bad
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
thing then they could should be able to
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
advertise it without without having the
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
state intervening
 
01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.430 align:start position:0%
state intervening
so

01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:40.470 align:start position:0%
so
okay

01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:41.510 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah you're not on the committee but
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%

01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
all right okay representative mclear

so um
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
chris we'll go over these
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know before we take them up on on
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%

01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
which ones people want to okay

all right
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
we did it
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
and look at that
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
jonathan you thought that was a big list
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
that we were going to be here all
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
morning right can i ask you a question a
 
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
i noticed that next week wednesday's
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
schedule includes all
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
i did i did and i will i will see if i
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
could uh intervene now and see if i can
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
change it
 
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.430 align:start position:0%
change it
um

01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
but we do i do know we have 1503
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
is still there so we will have to meet
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
no matter what for the tina three the
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%

01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
know is my goal is for us to be done
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
next week on thursday but we can't meet
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
in just one day yeah because anyways
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
thursday morning so we don't have to
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
come both days i mean to come here and
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill seems
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
well we still have the afternoon bill
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
let me find out whether i can cancel
 
01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and move things around and
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
then just have everything come on
 
01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:52.470 align:start position:0%
then just have everything come on
thursday

01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
you would rather just do this one day
 
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
well yeah to drive that far to talk
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
about one bill to me it seems
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
well it wouldn't be just one bill we
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of uh
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of wednesday if we were really
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
able to get everything done
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
my boy i'd be well i don't know i don't
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
know i think they close i know i know
 
01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:13.189 align:start position:0%
know i think they close i know i know
they

01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
officially the calendar doesn't come out
 
01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
until tonight but you know how much i
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
can cook and cook it let me see what i
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
can do but
 
01:54:20.719 --> 01:54:21.669 align:start position:0%
can do but
i

01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
i think we can announce we can actually
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
just announce the subcommittees are not
 
01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:26.229 align:start position:0%
just announce the subcommittees are not
meeting

01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay but it would be really good if it
 
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
were just one day for everybody i will
 
01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:32.229 align:start position:0%
were just one day for everybody i will
uh

01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
aim that because we did so well and
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
assuming we're going to do just this
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
well this afternoon
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
let's assume that we'll that anything
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's still hanging out there will be
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
done thursday morning okay
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
i think that would be good and i think
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know even if we start at nine
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
o'clock it means a full day but it's
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
only one full day i i hear you
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
you come a long ways too
 
01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:56.709 align:start position:0%
you come a long ways too
uh

01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
okay everybody everybody likes the one
 
01:54:59.840 --> 01:54:59.850 align:start position:0%
day okay all right
 
01:54:59.850 --> 01:55:02.870 align:start position:0%
day okay all right
[Laughter]

01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
but my goal is that we would be done
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
that day
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know next thursday we would exec
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
everything on on you know so that means
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
you have to stay here no matter how late
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
or how bad the snow storm is
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
that a week from now
 
01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:26.790 align:start position:0%
that a week from now
so

01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
all right so i'll go on
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:36.550 align:start position:0%

02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.599 --> 02:01:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what's happening
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.599 --> 02:02:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:40.239 --> 02:05:13.109 align:start position:0%
 
hey

02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.119 --> 02:05:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:58.629 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
are you
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:22.069 align:start position:0%
 
where

02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
anyway

02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:11.189 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think i um
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:31.360 --> 02:08:21.189 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:21.199 --> 02:08:24.149 align:start position:0%
 
then

02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:24.159 --> 02:08:48.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
the two other amendments they're
 
04:21:49.750 --> 04:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
they were sent to me unbeknownst to me
 
04:21:52.950 --> 04:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
because i don't check my emails
 
04:21:55.990 --> 04:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
so there uh hopefully we will get those
 
04:21:57.750 --> 04:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
so let's just take the one we got in
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
hand and get this one out of the way so
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:23.760 --> 04:22:36.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.640 --> 04:22:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
okay so uh hp 1039 uh started out with
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
my original bill that i put in for the
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
related to
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
clarifying that a beverage
 
04:22:54.800 --> 04:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
clarifying that a beverage
manufacturer

04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
if they want to have this uh off-premise
 
04:23:00.800 --> 04:23:03.429 align:start position:0%
if they want to have this uh off-premise
location

04:23:03.429 --> 04:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
location
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to actually
 
04:23:05.920 --> 04:23:07.269 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to actually
manufacture

04:23:07.269 --> 04:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
manufacture
 
04:23:09.750 --> 04:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
at that location
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
which was generally thought to what the
 
04:23:13.990 --> 04:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
bill was to be but it didn't really
 
04:23:16.469 --> 04:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
state it clearly
 
04:23:19.510 --> 04:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
and uh but that it was modeled if you
 
04:23:21.110 --> 04:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
all remember we
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
we've modeled after what we did with the
 
04:23:23.040 --> 04:23:25.750 align:start position:0%
we've modeled after what we did with the
wine

04:23:25.750 --> 04:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
bill madame labelle's bill which was for
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
her to have an outside location which
 
04:23:33.189 --> 04:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
was clearly trying to make wine in a
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
shopping mall was probably not a good
 
04:23:34.960 --> 04:23:36.070 align:start position:0%
shopping mall was probably not a good
idea

04:23:36.070 --> 04:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:23:37.830 --> 04:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
so this will allow them to have a
 
04:23:42.389 --> 04:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
separate location and it clarifies it we
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
did get an ag's opinion that what we
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
wrote did say that but this clarifies it
 
04:23:48.389 --> 04:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
once and for all
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh in the hearing i then brought in two
 
04:23:53.189 --> 04:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
more issues that uh the liquor
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
commission had come to them
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
and as you'll remember they've been
 
04:23:56.960 --> 04:23:58.149 align:start position:0%
and as you'll remember they've been
audited

04:23:58.149 --> 04:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
audited
 
04:23:59.990 --> 04:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
and been thoroughly
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
reviewed in multiple cases and so two
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
other issues that came up
 
04:24:05.520 --> 04:24:06.309 align:start position:0%
other issues that came up
well

04:24:06.309 --> 04:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
the one main issue was the the idea of
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
someone actually taking a license for
 
04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
multiple years
 
04:24:14.550 --> 04:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
in which nobody's ever thought that that
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
was a good idea
 
04:24:18.870 --> 04:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
and never been used but
 
04:24:20.710 --> 04:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
evidently i was around when we passed
 
04:24:20.720 --> 04:24:23.990 align:start position:0%
evidently i was around when we passed
that

04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:25.030 --> 04:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
but maybe
 
04:24:27.030 --> 04:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
maybe that was the year i was i was not
 
04:24:28.389 --> 04:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
on the committee did we figure that was
 
04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
maybe the year i wasn't on the committee
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
that year
 
04:24:31.680 --> 04:24:32.870 align:start position:0%
that year
yeah

04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
well i thought i probably thought it was
 
04:24:35.830 --> 04:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
a good idea it was a good business thing
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
that they didn't why you have to fill
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
out a form every year why not do it
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
every other year but so anyway so uh the
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
auditor said if no one's ever done it
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know get it off out of the statute
 
04:24:48.550 --> 04:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
so that's what section three
 
04:24:51.910 --> 04:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
is is to remove that then section two is
 
04:24:51.920 --> 04:24:52.950 align:start position:0%
is is to remove that then section two is
um

04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:54.309 --> 04:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
you know this is the devil's in the
 
04:24:56.630 --> 04:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
details when you write laws
 
04:24:56.640 --> 04:24:57.429 align:start position:0%
details when you write laws
and

04:24:57.429 --> 04:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:00.870 --> 04:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
that um this is someone who's a a direct
 
04:25:02.149 --> 04:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
shipper who
 
04:25:04.149 --> 04:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
the commission becomes attention to
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who's shipping into the state
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
and but the person never filed with the
 
04:25:11.189 --> 04:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
state and paid us their eight percent
 
04:25:13.830 --> 04:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
the john hunt memorial eight percent tax
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
and instead um they just waited and then
 
04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
the commission points it out well you
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
lost your license and they just waited
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
90 days and then they started up again
 
04:25:25.349 --> 04:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
so this is to ensure that when they lose
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
their license they really lose their
 
04:25:27.439 --> 04:25:29.189 align:start position:0%
their license they really lose their
license

04:25:29.189 --> 04:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
john hunt's rule of licensure
 
04:25:31.680 --> 04:25:33.590 align:start position:0%
john hunt's rule of licensure
so

04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
any questions on the amendment
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
or the underlying bill so there's

five

okay
 
04:32:46.880 --> 04:32:52.870 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
well i i'm waiting we're waiting for
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
these amendments here
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
right so i've got now i
 
04:33:03.390 --> 04:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
have all right so i have
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.600 --> 04:33:28.949 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:28.959 --> 04:33:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay so 1583 had several parts the first
 
04:33:54.150 --> 04:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
two were related to
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
trying to enforce that as a nightmare
 
04:34:11.279 --> 04:34:12.470 align:start position:0%
trying to enforce that as a nightmare
so

04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
the amendment takes that out
 
04:34:14.959 --> 04:34:15.910 align:start position:0%
the amendment takes that out
and

04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
the third section
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:34:22.150 --> 04:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
was their hours of operation
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
and the question was to remove easter
 
04:34:27.990 --> 04:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
because easter is
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
not a high holiday this is something
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
close to a holiday
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
but then when i sat down with the liquor
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and we were discussing this
 
04:34:40.709 --> 04:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
and reading the paragraph that says
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh it's already the commission may in
 
04:34:45.029 --> 04:34:45.039 align:start position:0%
its discretion
 
04:34:47.189 --> 04:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
so well if it's got discretion then why
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
tell them any days let them
 
04:34:51.510 --> 04:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
them decide and operate and
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
what days they want so we're moving
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
any particular day so we're not
 
04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
offending anybody religiously
 
04:35:00.629 --> 04:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
except maybe
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
somebody cares about thanksgiving day
 
04:35:04.789 --> 04:35:04.799 align:start position:0%
but probably the native americans are
 
04:35:06.150 --> 04:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
probably happy to see us take that out
 
04:35:06.160 --> 04:35:08.070 align:start position:0%
probably happy to see us take that out
too

04:35:08.070 --> 04:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:35:08.080 --> 04:35:10.230 align:start position:0%
too
so

04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:10.240 --> 04:35:11.750 align:start position:0%
so
any

04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.119 --> 04:36:01.429 align:start position:0%
 
just

04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:01.439 --> 04:36:02.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:36:02.789 --> 04:36:02.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
any comments
 
04:36:07.349 --> 04:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
kate do you want to tell us how terrible
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
so it could be potentially that we could
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
actually have a liquor store open on
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
thanksgiving and christmas
 
04:36:28.230 --> 04:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
but that only would be if the liquor
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
you know santa claus needs a place to
 
04:36:48.629 --> 04:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
no discussion
 
04:36:57.269 --> 04:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
all right uh the
 
04:36:57.279 --> 04:36:58.830 align:start position:0%
all right uh the
representative

04:36:58.830 --> 04:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:37:01.109 --> 04:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
patusek mr chairman i just want to say
 
04:37:02.709 --> 04:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
that i just think it particularly
 
04:37:06.470 --> 04:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
no that's okay we took it out and so it
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't target anybody the problem was
 
04:37:11.830 --> 04:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
the problem was that we were
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
theoretically open on passover well it's
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
but not on easter it says it may open
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
for business on any sunday or legal
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
holiday you don't even need that
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
sentence in there now
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
i'm saying this is specifically
 
04:37:24.959 --> 04:37:27.990 align:start position:0%
i'm saying this is specifically
targeting

04:37:27.990 --> 04:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:30.070 --> 04:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
those who practice a christian faith
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:34.869 --> 04:37:34.879 align:start position:0%
i thought i was going the opposite
 
04:37:34.879 --> 04:37:38.310 align:start position:0%
i thought i was going the opposite
direction

04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:42.629 --> 04:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
by taking out any identifying qualities
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay that you're entitled to your
 
04:37:44.320 --> 04:37:46.230 align:start position:0%
okay that you're entitled to your
opinion

04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
you actually don't even you actually
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
don't even need this section alone you
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
repeal the whole section of the law
 
04:37:50.719 --> 04:37:52.230 align:start position:0%
repeal the whole section of the law
um

04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:53.670 --> 04:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't be surprised that the the
 
04:37:56.400 --> 04:37:59.349 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't be surprised that the the
unions

04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%

the
 
04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
fundamental issue as i saw it
 
04:39:49.030 --> 04:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%

ninety 1692 dollars a year
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to get a license
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:20.310 --> 04:40:20.320 align:start position:0%

liquor commission and i just wanted to
 
04:40:50.628 --> 04:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh on your comments mr chairman that
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
this uh amendment would not be limited
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
to just farmers right this would be for
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
any business person who decides they
 
04:41:01.270 --> 04:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
want to open a
 
04:41:01.280 --> 04:41:02.550 align:start position:0%
want to open a
a

04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
a starter a nano store
 
04:41:06.788 --> 04:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
you're going to go there
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
i didn't use the word i know you didn't
 
04:41:10.708 --> 04:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
it has broad implications
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
yes it definitely it definitely opens up
 
04:41:18.310 --> 04:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
more opportunity for people to be in the
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
business but at the end of the day still
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
they still got to get a federal license
 
04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
which is going to be
 
04:41:25.270 --> 04:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
much more of a bear than our state
 
04:41:25.280 --> 04:41:27.510 align:start position:0%
much more of a bear than our state
license

04:41:27.510 --> 04:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:41:27.520 --> 04:41:35.830 align:start position:0%
license
so

04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.590 --> 04:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
did you um
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
have to pull the mic did you draft this
 
04:41:41.190 --> 04:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
amendment yes i did with the liquor
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
commission yes i did okay
 
04:41:43.440 --> 04:41:44.948 align:start position:0%
commission yes i did okay
thanks

04:41:44.948 --> 04:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
but did you just say it's going to open
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
up a can of worms
 
04:41:51.270 --> 04:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
no no no no no the the the canned worms
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
i mean when you're when you get a
 
04:41:55.430 --> 04:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
federal license right they have
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
huge requirements and you know
 
04:41:58.080 --> 04:41:59.110 align:start position:0%
huge requirements and you know
so

04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:59.120 --> 04:42:00.708 align:start position:0%
so
the

04:42:00.708 --> 04:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a state license is
 
04:42:02.560 --> 04:42:03.670 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a state license is
pretty

04:42:03.670 --> 04:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
limited in terms of what we do but it's
 
04:42:05.840 --> 04:42:08.708 align:start position:0%
limited in terms of what we do but it's
not

04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
but in this case that that
 
04:42:13.750 --> 04:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
we we've taken obviously we just saved
 
04:42:16.708 --> 04:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
them thirteen hundred dollars
 
04:42:21.030 --> 04:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
to get in terms of getting a license so
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
so this
 
04:42:26.470 --> 04:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
no i'm confused this is
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:42:27.520 --> 04:42:28.390 align:start position:0%
this is
oh

04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:42:28.400 --> 04:42:29.750 align:start position:0%
oh
8

04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
8
 
04:42:29.760 --> 04:42:43.830 align:start position:0%
8
308

04:42:43.830 --> 04:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:43.840 --> 04:42:44.868 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson question uh
 
04:42:49.510 --> 04:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the original bill it has the section
 
04:42:51.430 --> 04:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
one that talks about 65 percent of the
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
final products will be
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
from products grown in new hampshire
 
04:42:57.270 --> 04:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
what happens to that all of that is gone
 
04:42:59.190 --> 04:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay so if you look if you look at the
 
04:42:59.200 --> 04:43:00.390 align:start position:0%
okay so if you look if you look at the
amendment

04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh and this is always
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
always good things to learn
 
04:43:07.030 --> 04:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
is that it starts out on line five it
 
04:43:10.948 --> 04:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
says amend the bill by replacing all
 
04:43:13.030 --> 04:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
after the enacting clause that basically
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
means everything that was in the
 
04:43:16.230 --> 04:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
original bill i i got that but then
 
04:43:18.150 --> 04:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
so then what happened so one and two so
 
04:43:20.638 --> 04:43:21.590 align:start position:0%
so then what happened so one and two so
one

04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
so then for them to find the
 
04:43:24.400 --> 04:43:25.670 align:start position:0%
so then for them to find the
rsa

04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
04:43:27.750 --> 04:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we're amending
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're saying in section and so one
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
that little one there means section one
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
new paragraph
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
so they're saying that
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
in rsa 178.6 if you go find paragraph
 
04:43:41.680 --> 04:43:44.948 align:start position:0%
in rsa 178.6 if you go find paragraph
three

04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
you're gonna now add a new paragraph
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
three a
 
04:43:49.200 --> 04:43:50.708 align:start position:0%
three a
okay

04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
and then in that three a because this
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
was creating is the actual creating that
 
04:43:56.708 --> 04:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
they could there's somebody under a
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
thousand and then
 
04:44:00.628 --> 04:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill says now let's
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
go to rsa 178 29

roman numeral five little b
 
04:44:08.788 --> 04:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
and in this section
 
04:44:10.868 --> 04:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to identify the dollar
 
04:44:10.878 --> 04:44:12.868 align:start position:0%
we're going to identify the dollar
amounts

04:44:12.868 --> 04:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
all right um

04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:08.910 --> 04:46:08.920 align:start position:0%

um

04:46:29.190 --> 04:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:31.590 --> 04:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
i believe i forwarded it to everybody
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
was the bulletin but i'm not sure did
 
04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
it was it was a bulletin
 
04:46:40.240 --> 04:46:41.430 align:start position:0%
it was it was a bulletin
uh

04:46:41.430 --> 04:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:46:44.708 --> 04:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
is that that a bill or is a bullet
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
yeah oh shhh
 
04:46:51.270 --> 04:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay so what this uh to remind everybody
 
04:46:53.350 --> 04:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
with this bill this bill was the one in
 
04:46:53.360 --> 04:46:54.310 align:start position:0%
with this bill this bill was the one in
which

04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:46:54.320 --> 04:46:55.270 align:start position:0%
which
um

04:46:55.270 --> 04:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:57.990 --> 04:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
it became to our attention that if you
 
04:46:58.000 --> 04:46:58.948 align:start position:0%
it became to our attention that if you
had

04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:46:58.958 --> 04:46:59.990 align:start position:0%
had
multiple

04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
04:47:01.670 --> 04:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
liquor licenses
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
that the commission may require you
 
04:47:07.990 --> 04:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
to have to use separate registers
 
04:47:08.000 --> 04:47:08.708 align:start position:0%
to have to use separate registers
to

04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:47:11.590 --> 04:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
use the different purchases so if you
 
04:47:14.830 --> 04:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:17.830 --> 04:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
a beverage manufacturer and also had a
 
04:47:19.750 --> 04:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
restaurant you're in the restaurant you
 
04:47:21.430 --> 04:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
had a nice meal and say now can i take a
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
six-pack home
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
they might be apt to send you to a
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
different cash register to get that
 
04:47:27.760 --> 04:47:28.948 align:start position:0%
different cash register to get that
six-pack

04:47:28.948 --> 04:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
six-pack
 
04:47:30.628 --> 04:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
so with this
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
bulletin makes it clear
 
04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
is that that will not be necessary that
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
as long as their point of sale software
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
is able to handle those multiple
 
04:47:43.030 --> 04:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
transactions so that they can um
 
04:47:45.990 --> 04:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
the licensee can appropriately
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
give the commission uh exactly uh what
 
04:47:52.628 --> 04:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
sales of that category that license
 
04:47:52.638 --> 04:47:53.910 align:start position:0%
sales of that category that license
information

04:47:53.910 --> 04:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
that there would be no need to have a
 
04:47:57.670 --> 04:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
separate point of sale system
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
so at this point
 
04:47:59.280 --> 04:48:00.628 align:start position:0%
so at this point
um

04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:02.230 --> 04:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
i think i mean i don't i don't want to
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
kill the bill only because i would like
 
04:48:06.868 --> 04:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
to hold on to it so we can actually see
 
04:48:09.270 --> 04:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
come and come back in september and hear
 
04:48:12.628 --> 04:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
hear everything yes so i can ask and yes
 
04:48:12.638 --> 04:48:24.830 align:start position:0%
hear everything yes so i can ask and yes
what's

04:48:24.830 --> 04:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
the licensee who offers
 
04:48:38.150 --> 04:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the site may use the same point of
 
04:48:40.628 --> 04:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
sale as liquor license so would the
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
why don't you come over to the
 
04:49:04.390 --> 04:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
04:49:09.030 --> 04:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding from the example if i
 
04:49:11.190 --> 04:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
recall the example correctly is a
 
04:49:13.750 --> 04:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
a business that holds a what we call a
 
04:49:15.430 --> 04:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
combination license beer and wine
 
04:49:15.440 --> 04:49:16.550 align:start position:0%
combination license beer and wine
license

04:49:16.550 --> 04:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:49:16.560 --> 04:49:17.670 align:start position:0%
license
has

04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:49:20.230 --> 04:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
a within their facility
 
04:49:20.240 --> 04:49:21.030 align:start position:0%
a within their facility
a

04:49:21.030 --> 04:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:49:25.110 --> 04:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
separate food operation that that right
 
04:49:27.910 --> 04:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
prepares food to go or operates a food
 
04:49:27.920 --> 04:49:29.190 align:start position:0%
prepares food to go or operates a food
store

04:49:29.190 --> 04:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
store
 
04:49:29.200 --> 04:49:30.310 align:start position:0%
store
then

04:49:30.310 --> 04:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
that they needed to have two registers
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
and i am here to tell you that that is
 
04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
not correct
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
that the only licensee
 
04:49:41.830 --> 04:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
that excuse me the only transactions
 
04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
that needed to be recorded for the
 
04:49:43.440 --> 04:49:44.550 align:start position:0%
that needed to be recorded for the
purposes

04:49:44.550 --> 04:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
of alcohol one registry will do it if if
 
04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
i decide i want to get a milk
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
six pack of beer and go get myself a
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
meatball sub
 
04:49:59.350 --> 04:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
from the from the food side of the house
 
04:50:01.110 --> 04:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's no need to have that done
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
through a separate register we
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's just not accurate
 
04:50:05.200 --> 04:50:06.310 align:start position:0%
that's just not accurate
okay

04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:08.788 --> 04:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not in the guidance
 
04:50:08.798 --> 04:50:09.910 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's not in the guidance
document

04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
document
 
04:50:09.920 --> 04:50:11.030 align:start position:0%
document
because

04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
it's it's not
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
accurate it's not required right
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
so hence the reason why i'd like to
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
interim study this pill
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
so that we will have a chance to come in
 
04:50:24.550 --> 04:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
september just to make sure
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
we if anybody hears of a horror story
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
where they had to use separate
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
point-of-sale systems well i would i
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
would also point out to the chairman and
 
04:50:36.150 --> 04:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:36.160 --> 04:50:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
we

04:50:37.510 --> 04:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
always encourage
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
businesses who have questions
 
04:50:43.990 --> 04:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
to contact the commission if you're not
 
04:50:44.000 --> 04:50:45.030 align:start position:0%
to contact the commission if you're not
sure

04:50:45.030 --> 04:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
or if you're relying upon information
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
that's provided to you by someone else
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
you can get the
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
answer to your question from the
 
04:50:53.840 --> 04:50:55.110 align:start position:0%
answer to your question from the
commission

04:50:55.110 --> 04:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
and and we'll be happy to answer that
 
04:50:58.390 --> 04:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
for you and
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately over my time
 
04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
business people who sometimes will rely
 
04:51:04.080 --> 04:51:05.350 align:start position:0%
business people who sometimes will rely
upon

04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
upon
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
comments offered to them by someone else
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
saying well you can't do that because i
 
04:51:12.310 --> 04:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
was told you can't do that 20 years ago
 
04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
and so you
 
04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
and and it's not accurate so we would
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage
 
04:51:19.110 --> 04:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
any business owner who holds a license
 
04:51:20.708 --> 04:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
from the commission if they have
 
04:51:20.718 --> 04:51:21.750 align:start position:0%
from the commission if they have
questions

04:51:21.750 --> 04:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:51:24.390 --> 04:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
contact us we want to make sure
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
you get clarity
 
04:51:28.708 --> 04:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
in the in the questions that you have to
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
ask yeah i would say that there is
 
04:51:33.830 --> 04:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
two is two issues here one is that
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely there are times where people
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
are rely on old news old information
 
04:51:41.990 --> 04:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
and or let's just say wise tale you know
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
i always thought that was true
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
but they're also the other problem with
 
04:51:47.590 --> 04:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
this is when
 
04:51:47.600 --> 04:51:48.550 align:start position:0%
this is when
a

04:51:48.550 --> 04:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
auditor comes in
 
04:51:50.480 --> 04:51:51.750 align:start position:0%
auditor comes in
and

04:51:51.750 --> 04:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:51.760 --> 04:51:53.270 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:56.470 --> 04:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
the the person the licensee starts
 
04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
trying to produce the reports
 
04:52:00.628 --> 04:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
and the auditor says you don't have this
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
on a separate point of sale system
 
04:52:05.430 --> 04:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
and kind of grouchy you know
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
i have to you know spend a little more
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
time here sorting through your numbers
 
04:52:12.550 --> 04:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
or something that the uh
 
04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
and this would only be an audit because
 
04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
most of the time
 
04:52:18.390 --> 04:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
the licensee just fills out the form and
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
mails it in
 
04:52:21.750 --> 04:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
so this would be an audit and it
 
04:52:24.868 --> 04:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
sometimes is a little scary to have
 
04:52:26.550 --> 04:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
an auditor there
 
04:52:29.270 --> 04:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
and and they seem a little rough and
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
gruff that the licensee might be fearful
 
04:52:33.440 --> 04:52:34.390 align:start position:0%
gruff that the licensee might be fearful
to

04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
say can i talk to your boss and see
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
whether you really
 
04:52:39.510 --> 04:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
have to have it done separately i'll
 
04:52:42.310 --> 04:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
make sure the examiner
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
named amy knows that she's being
 
04:52:46.550 --> 04:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
portrayed as a rough
 
04:52:47.910 --> 04:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
scary person
 
04:52:50.390 --> 04:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
that she needs to say in a friendly
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
happy boys i'm so glad to see that you
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
have your information
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
as as readily available as you do
 
04:53:00.550 --> 04:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
but to to
 
04:53:03.190 --> 04:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
to address mr thompson's question and
 
04:53:06.150 --> 04:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
the industry circular that was produced
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
yes in relation to 1556
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
was to clarify
 
04:53:13.830 --> 04:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
the issue that was presented
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
at a beverage manufacturers facility
 
04:53:19.350 --> 04:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
so that it's it's written in that
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
vein alone
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
we did not address this question that mr
 
04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
thompson mentioned
 
04:53:25.200 --> 04:53:26.628 align:start position:0%
thompson mentioned
because

04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's not an issue as far as
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
as far as you're concerned but that but
 
04:53:34.070 --> 04:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
maybe for the licensee
 
04:53:35.910 --> 04:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
that when it came time
 
04:53:37.670 --> 04:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
for amy to
 
04:53:39.510 --> 04:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
that maybe they felt well amy wouldn't
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
be the person who
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
would visit the
 
04:53:44.230 --> 04:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
retailer okay
 
04:53:44.240 --> 04:53:45.190 align:start position:0%
retailer okay
so

04:53:45.190 --> 04:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:47.350 --> 04:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
um who who's that who's what order is
 
04:53:47.360 --> 04:53:48.868 align:start position:0%
um who who's that who's what order is
that

04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:51.270 --> 04:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
there is no auditor that visited
 
04:53:53.350 --> 04:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
i mean they don't visit that's not their
 
04:53:54.628 --> 04:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
the auditors
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
really work with manufacturers and
 
04:53:56.160 --> 04:53:57.750 align:start position:0%
really work with manufacturers and
wholesalers

04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
wholesalers
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
because those are the businesses that
 
04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
have tax liability
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
right and they're there to ensure that
 
04:54:06.390 --> 04:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
the records match up with the reports i
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
would think it would always come in with
 
04:54:10.550 --> 04:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
someone who's also um
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
does rooms and meals
 
04:54:14.470 --> 04:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
well it may
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
if this if this was attributed it would
 
04:54:19.830 --> 04:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
probably to be an investigator someone
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
from the enforcement side of the house
 
04:54:21.360 --> 04:54:22.070 align:start position:0%
from the enforcement side of the house
but

04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know i just want to make
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
sure that it's crystal clear to you all
 
04:54:29.350 --> 04:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
that the requirement for a second
 
04:54:31.110 --> 04:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
register under that example is not
 
04:54:31.120 --> 04:54:32.310 align:start position:0%
register under that example is not
necessary

04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:54:33.350 --> 04:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
got it
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
so my question then mr chair is why do
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
we want to put this off
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.948 --> 04:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
well there is no amendment for this one
 
04:54:42.958 --> 04:54:44.550 align:start position:0%
well there is no amendment for this one
what

04:54:44.550 --> 04:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:54:46.230 --> 04:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay we just were given them and we had
 
04:54:47.830 --> 04:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment in our in our file for
 
04:54:47.840 --> 04:54:50.628 align:start position:0%
the amendment in our in our file for
1556.

04:54:50.628 --> 04:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
1556.
 
04:54:50.638 --> 04:54:52.470 align:start position:0%
1556.
0.282

04:54:52.470 --> 04:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
0.282
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
but that's the old
 
04:54:55.590 --> 04:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
that was the old amendment right what's
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
the date on that
 
04:55:00.230 --> 04:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
right so we don't want to say we don't
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
want it it's that's not necessary
 
04:55:05.190 --> 04:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
okay so then why
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
so i just want to i just want to interim
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
study 1556 period
 
04:55:13.590 --> 04:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay and then and that way we can
 
04:55:15.670 --> 04:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
be you know if anybody has a problem
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
we'll hear about it
 
04:55:21.190 --> 04:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:21.200 --> 04:55:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:55:24.470 --> 04:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
all right everybody comfortable with the
 
04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.230 --> 04:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
no amendment that amendment that
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
amendment came in during the hearing and
 
04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
it was just
 
04:55:37.510 --> 04:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
thinking that it was out of the problem
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
but it really
 
04:55:41.830 --> 04:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
was no problem
 
04:55:41.840 --> 04:55:44.230 align:start position:0%
was no problem
but

04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:44.240 --> 04:55:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:55:47.830 --> 04:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
all right through all those in favor of
 
04:55:49.590 --> 04:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
interim studying
 
04:55:52.390 --> 04:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
1556 raise your hand
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%

all right
 
04:57:01.110 --> 04:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:01.120 --> 04:57:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:57:09.270 --> 04:57:09.280 align:start position:0%

talking with the sponsor
 
05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
and co-sponsors on this bill
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
they also have another bill very similar
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
to this in labor
 
05:08:54.628 --> 05:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
so it's almost redundant so they're
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
going to work with that one and we'll
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:00.958 --> 05:09:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:09:02.070 --> 05:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:09:03.670 --> 05:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
all good
 
05:09:05.430 --> 05:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
all right all those in favor of interim
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
study raise your hand
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:39.840 --> 05:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
you
