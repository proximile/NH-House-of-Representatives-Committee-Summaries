committee
 
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
and then also what he thinks what date
 
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
he thinks he might be doing the
 
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
i have uh set the 26th
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
for us to exec as a full committee on
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
the bills that we have before
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
us and i think that's going in the
 
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.710 align:start position:0%
us and i think that's going in the
calendar

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure we have all the
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
reports and all the divisions finished
 
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
i have to get together with the
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
speaker and the clerk to schedule the
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
presentation to the
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
to the house on the budget i don't know
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
whether they've got me scheduled
 
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
in those that three-day session or
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
whether i should try to do it the week
 
00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.349 align:start position:0%
whether i should try to do it the week
before

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
like on the 30th or or the 31st so
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
i've got to get together with them and
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
see what what they want to do because
 
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know we've got to have a a big space
 
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't know
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's complicated to go and book that and
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
all that stuff so
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to find out probably today
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
whether there's
 
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
something set up for us on that
 
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.070 align:start position:0%
something set up for us on that
three-day

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
three-day
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
deal okay great
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that question
 
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.790 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that question
because

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
that that stirs in my mind the idea that
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're not scheduled to vote uh out
 
00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
of uh division three house bill 254
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
or 600 until monday if we did that on
 
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.990 align:start position:0%
or 600 until monday if we did that on
monday

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
monday
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
it would not hit the calendar
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
so that it was noticed for the 26th
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
is that a is that a problem do i do we
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
need to vote on
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
on 254 sooner so it can be in the
 
00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.270 align:start position:0%
on 254 sooner so it can be in the
calendar

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
no i'll just just make the assumption
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
and have it in the calendar for the 26th
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
we'll have all the bills that before all
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
the divisions and we'll have them all
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
we can continue to plan on voting it out
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
of division three on monday without it
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
being a problem
 
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.830 align:start position:0%
being a problem
yes

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%

um could represent wilder please
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
clarify something he said he said
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're gonna need a big space
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
for the informational session on the
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
budget i was unsure what he meant by
 
00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.390 align:start position:0%
budget i was unsure what he meant by
that

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
well if we're going to have
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have we don't have a method to
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
do 400 people on a zoom session
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
so i assume i'll get together with the
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
clerk and the speaker and see if
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's any other plan but i assume that
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
we'll have
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
maybe an hour or so uh in those three
 
00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:35.909 align:start position:0%
maybe an hour or so uh in those three
days

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
if we want to do it before the house and
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
have session
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
and hence questions and so on but uh
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
i haven't got into that discussion yet
 
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.909 align:start position:0%
i haven't got into that discussion yet
so

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm still confused but that's okay
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
no i just what i meant by the big space
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
was if we want to have it before all the
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
represent no i
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
just my husband just came in the room
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
just so you'll know um
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
so okay i'm trying to understand i
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
thought that we were having
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
the budget on the floor of the house
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
which will be at the sports arena
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
on the seventh which is the first of the
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
three days
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i thought that i thought we as i
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
remember the briefing needs to be a
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
couple of days before so are you
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
thinking we will have
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
the briefing
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
at an on-site location
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know how else we can do it and
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
still do it before everybody in the
 
00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.350 align:start position:0%
still do it before everybody in the
house

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
because of the because of the setup we
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been we haven't been able to
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
work out a
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
400 member zoom at this point
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
so well i don't know whether we have to
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
have the briefing before that or whether
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be or it's going to be
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
part of that because we
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
we could do it on the first day and then
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
vote on the third day or whatever
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
but i haven't had a chance to sit down
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
with the speaker and this and the clerk
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
and and work that out
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
every time i went to the meeting i got a
 
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
meeting here so
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm not seeing any other
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
questions so
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
um let's uh let's get uh ourselves
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
oriented to the day
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
um i've i've emailed this and i think
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
we've uh
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
we've shared this in other ways that
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
we're going to hit
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
hb2 sections 26 30
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
31 33 38 and we're going to finish up
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
section 39 uh representative walner will
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh will
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
will take us to conclusion there i'd
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
discuss those and hopefully vote on
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
those and then we'll have
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
a time i think to talk about um
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
hb1 and hb2 so so that's
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%

listed as the host so it uh it's within
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
your authority to do it
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
oh well let's see how i do that then
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
um i look go to participants i go
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
earth before you do that can i just ask
 
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:29.829 align:start position:0%
earth before you do that can i just ask
either

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
sharon or i'm sorry representative
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
norgan or representative
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
um any of the people that want the
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
tutorial what it is they're looking for
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
in a tutorial is that how to search the
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
document is it
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
last night i was looking for something
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
um i was looking for the sununu center
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
on the list
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
and you can't really find stuff on the
 
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:03.910 align:start position:0%
and you can't really find stuff on the
list

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
i mean it's really difficult so that i
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
think we just need a clarification of
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
how do we even find
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
a department on your list it seems
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
difficult anyway that's whatever that
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm just confused
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
no no you're not going to hear me let me
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
let me speak you don't need to share any
 
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.630 align:start position:0%
let me speak you don't need to share any
screens

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
screens
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
i understand that okay um
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
you're right you can't i mean i assume
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
people be looking at this on a computer
 
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.389 align:start position:0%
people be looking at this on a computer
screen

00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
and they would be searching for the
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
words because it is a pdf document and
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
you can search for it
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
but let me say this um i don't think you
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
have to worry about it
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
um as we discussed uh yesterday
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
this is not the budget so i don't think
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking any more about
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
that document and
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the channel will correct me if
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong but assuming we're
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
not referring to it any further are
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
there any
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
other issues with that document
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
um i guess my problem was the same is
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
that i'm trying to find things on there
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
because i didn't
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
i as i understood we were adding to this
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
baseline is how you wanted to do the
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
budget and i
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
was trying to find places and i couldn't
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
find things i tried to figure out
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
what order it was in and i actually did
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
try to use it on the computer
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
and do a find or search but i couldn't
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
figure out where you put things
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
and what words you use to um i i
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually on on a few different places i
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
tried up to 10 different ways to search
 
00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:32.790 align:start position:0%
tried up to 10 different ways to search
it

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
and i still couldn't find things okay
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
fair enough but i know that these are
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
not my words
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
this is the dhhs document this is not
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
something i made up
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
so what i search for when i'm searching
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
it is the four digit account numbers
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
if i happen to know the actual name it
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
will work but you have to know the
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
actual name of course not just some
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
something that's close so i tend to use
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
account numbers
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
but i did not make up the ordering or
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
the wording that's a straight that's
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
especially just straight out of dhhs so
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
you all work from the
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
big pdf document that you that we get
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
and we also at the same time got the
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and that's what i was
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
working from so that's exactly what that
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
document is
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we have to go if we search
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
we put in the search issue as the
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
account number
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
so for instance in in your case if
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable which i think
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
please share the document and do a live
 
00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:29.350 align:start position:0%
please share the document and do a live
example

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
please yes i understand that but you had
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
me doing a bunch of other things
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
right now buddy and i just don't have
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
that right at my fingertips if you give
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
me something i don't know
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
we it got overlooked yesterday i asked
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
people to help me figure out
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
what we were going to do today and
 
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.509 align:start position:0%
what we were going to do today and
tomorrow

00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
and i and all of us forgot that we were
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
going to do this tutorial
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
wait a second so representative rogers
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
has properly reminded us
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
that we did commit to doing the tutorial
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
and and it's and it's my fault for not
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
putting it on the thursday agenda and
 
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
reminding everyone
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry but representative
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
rogers is correct now what were you
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
saying representative rogers
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
um are we not going to president earth
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
said we're not going to use this anymore
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
the fact or are we i think we've
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's largely been used i think it's
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
largely been used it served its purpose
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
to be a baseline
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
we went through several major accounts
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday to figure out
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know the difference between the fy21
 
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.110 align:start position:0%
you know the difference between the fy21
baseline

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
baseline
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
and what the governor's budget would
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh do in terms of using the funds
 
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.790 align:start position:0%
uh do in terms of using the funds
available

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
to us from the ways and means estimate
 
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.990 align:start position:0%
to us from the ways and means estimate
so

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that i think uh we
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
got to mmis
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
and we were largely out of resources at
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
i don't really see us needing the earth
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
working document at this point
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
i think it served its purpose which is
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
kind of why i didn't think it was
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
worth sharing with the public because it
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
was such a transitory working document
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative wallner you had your hand
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
so i guess mr mr chair i
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
so if we're not going to use that
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
there it is there it is okay
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
so so can you show us how you would
 
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.069 align:start position:0%
so so can you show us how you would
search

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
search
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
like so for ex example search on
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the medicaid code that we used what
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
was it something like
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
so up in the upper right hand corner in
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
the search bar
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
you typed in seven nine eight four
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
start typing 7948 7948
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
and and there he found medicaid
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
management so
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
so if you search on the activity codes
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
that have been used by the department
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
and by the governor
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
you can find the account lines
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
now it would also work i think if if he
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
were to type in
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
um something like uh admin
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
on aging can you type words in
 
00:16:57.519 --> 00:17:01.749 align:start position:0%
on aging can you type words in
admin

00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
on adm there it is
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
yeah there it is so so you can use
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
either the account code or the names
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
of the state he didn't invent any of
 
00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.069 align:start position:0%
of the state he didn't invent any of
that

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
so that that's how you do a search in a
 
00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:21.429 align:start position:0%
so that that's how you do a search in a
pdf

00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
pdf
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on searching on
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
i i think for the most part we're kind
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
of this document has served its useful
 
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.590 align:start position:0%
of this document has served its useful
life

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
because it was used yesterday
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
extensively for us to figure out
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
how much how many dollars we had
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
to invest in various parts of the budget
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
an fy21 baseline so
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative irv
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any questions on on
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative verse document at this
 
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.630 align:start position:0%
representative verse document at this
point

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
okay can we go and thank you
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%

thank you representative wallner
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
so if we're not using representative
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
erf's document any longer
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
how are we how are we proceeding
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
on the behalf of one we are proceeding
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
with the discussions that have been
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled for
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh thursday and for friday um uh
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%

but that the discussion that we've had
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
will be reflected in the house bill one
 
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.549 align:start position:0%
will be reflected in the house bill one
amendment

00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
that we'll bring in for discussion and
 
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.070 align:start position:0%
that we'll bring in for discussion and
voting

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully i said that in the
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
email i sent earlier
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
that voting on it on monday is is an
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
aspirational goal
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
um all right so house or
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 section 26.
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
can we pull up that mr ripple and show
 
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:36.830 align:start position:0%
can we pull up that mr ripple and show
it

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:50.830 align:start position:0%

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay can everyone see it on their screen
 
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:57.750 align:start position:0%
okay can everyone see it on their screen
or

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
and i can bring up the statute that this
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
references since it may not be too
 
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.350 align:start position:0%
references since it may not be too
obvious

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative weiler when we discussed
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
this initially
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
said that he would recommend that we
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
just simply remove this section
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
is that still the case representative
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
weiler i think that's what we heard from
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
ms rounds and some other people in hhs
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
they said even if we remove this it
 
00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:35.750 align:start position:0%
they said even if we remove this it
still

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
would have the same effect what's what's
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
so did you want me to bring karen over
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.840 --> 00:21:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
good morning hi hello
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
um i i think that uh
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
there might be some confusion between
 
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
this section and another section this is
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
a section that the department
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
would kindly request to keep in
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
this allows us to transfer funds
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
from personnel class lines to elsewhere
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
and the best example i can give was was
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
one that
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative earth got to see this
 
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.230 align:start position:0%
representative earth got to see this
morning

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
um which is we budget moe for lots of
 
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.149 align:start position:0%
um which is we budget moe for lots of
things

00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
in personnel lines and so if a person of
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
a position
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
is not filled we still need to meet that
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
moe so we need to move those funds out
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
personnel line sometimes to contract
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
lines to make sure that we meet the moe
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
so it is a really important
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
provision to be able to manage the
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
department financially
 
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
um and also the other thing i would say
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
about it is it also deport
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
it forces hhs to
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
manage their own budget so when without
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
this language
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
hhs would be put into the pool
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
with all other agencies uh
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
regarding personnel so if a personnel
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
line is overspent
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
you go to the pool to bring money in but
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
you can't use that pool for anything
 
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.750 align:start position:0%
you can't use that pool for anything
else

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
so it it sort of incrementer mingles us
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
with everyone else and
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that dhhs manage
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
their own budget
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
and and not be reliant on other agencies
 
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.149 align:start position:0%
and and not be reliant on other agencies
lapses

00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
my note did say that you suggested
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
removal and then we i added a note that
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
the department will address it
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
and i i think ms brown's just addressed
 
00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.029 align:start position:0%
and i i think ms brown's just addressed
it

00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
are you satisfied or do you have other
 
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:02.789 align:start position:0%
are you satisfied or do you have other
questions

00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
sir well i think i was confused with a
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
different section
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
i got confused if you want i would make
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
just one other thing i'm sorry go ahead
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
um the other thing i would add is the
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
department put in the request for this
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
transfer authority to end on 6 30 at the
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
end of the biennium
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
um which has been traditionally what's
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
thing so we would request that it went
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
until the end of the biennium the
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
governor's office did change it
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
to be january um and my understanding it
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
is that they
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
wanted us to see what would happen
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
if we only had it if we didn't have it
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
i'm very nervous to see what happens if
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
we don't have it
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
so that that would be my request
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay so let's look again at section
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
26 if we could miss ripple
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
before we head this in there would be
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
several agencies that would
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
ask to have more people added and so on
 
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.990 align:start position:0%
ask to have more people added and so on
and

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
tell us why they had to add them and add
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
people to their budget
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
and then when they ran short of money
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
they would transfer money out of those
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
lines that they knew they were going to
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
keep empty anyway
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
and spend it on other things and we
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to keep all the other
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
departments strictly
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
to personnel money goes into personal
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
alliance because
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
what happens is at the end of the year
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
das goes in and because some of the
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
departments didn't have enough money put
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
in to cover all the
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
benefit lines especially in the
 
00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:58.390 align:start position:0%
benefit lines especially in the
insurance

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
that they would take the uh ones that
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
had a higher
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
higher income people and they would they
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
would have a higher input
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
and they would level them out with the
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
lower income people that didn't have as
 
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.950 align:start position:0%
lower income people that didn't have as
much

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
contribution toward the insurance so das
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
wanted them all to all the personnel
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
lines to stay
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
as personnel lines for that reason so we
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
put that in
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
but um several years ago we decided that
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
hhs needed more flexibility and i i
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
supported it i think we all did been
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
around a while and we put this in
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
but it's it's kind of temporary because
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know we might want them to go back
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
if the das comes in with the same
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
problem we might
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
want to have everybody keep all the
 
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.350 align:start position:0%
want to have everybody keep all the
personnel

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
so i i my interpretation is that this
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
this provides dhhs additional
 
00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:56.870 align:start position:0%
this provides dhhs additional
flexibility

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
and if they were to operate in a
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
constrained budget environment
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
that that flexibility might be
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
really important to helping them meet
 
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.630 align:start position:0%
really important to helping them meet
needs

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
so is that the case ms rounds in a
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
constrained budget environment this
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
becomes more important
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
yes exactly exactly and and i think i've
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
talked before like we we never know what
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
crisis is coming right we didn't see the
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis all of these things things
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
that happen within a biennium and we
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
need to move funds from one area to
 
00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:28.789 align:start position:0%
need to move funds from one area to
another

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
to address the crisis
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
so then if if we're predisposed to
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
accepting this language
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
um i think we just should uh
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
the committee members should comment on
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
whether we should go with the governor's
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
expiration date of january 1 23
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
or the traditional end of the biennium
 
00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:52.630 align:start position:0%
or the traditional end of the biennium
june

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
june
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
30 of 23. are there any thoughts on that
 
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.870 align:start position:0%
30 of 23. are there any thoughts on that
subject

00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
well i would think that the end of the
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
biennium would make
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
more sense i mean we would just
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
discontinue it
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
before the end of the year into the
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
biennium doesn't seem
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
like a good plan but i mean
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's just my thoughts yeah do we have
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
anyone from the governor's office that
 
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:30.630 align:start position:0%
anyone from the governor's office that
might

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
explain to us the reasoning for
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
kind of an unusual end date
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to tap dance and i'm going
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm betting they did that because
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
they thought that if you get if you let
 
00:27:56.399 --> 00:27:57.029 align:start position:0%
they thought that if you get if you let
that

00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility go all the way to the end of
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
you start to motivate uh the use it or
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
lose it mentality of a lot of budget
 
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.789 align:start position:0%
lose it mentality of a lot of budget
people

00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
that say let's figure out how we can
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
obligate or spend this money
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
and that tends that use it or lose it
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
attitude is often wasteful
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
and so maybe they thought let's let's go
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
ahead and allow the
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
the flexibility but let's end the
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility so that we don't create
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
a end of the year panic buying
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
that would be my theory for why they
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
um why don't we defer this and see if we
 
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:37.669 align:start position:0%
um why don't we defer this and see if we
could

00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
invite somebody from the governor's
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
office to just
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
restate why they wanted it six months
 
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.630 align:start position:0%
restate why they wanted it six months
early

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
early
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh who can who can reach out to either
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
of those two
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll come back to that and
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
those of you who have your hb2 up
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is another one liz rounds where i
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
think we said that the department should
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
come talk again about this
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
yes kevin could you bring meredith over
 
00:29:29.279 --> 00:29:33.190 align:start position:0%
yes kevin could you bring meredith over
sure

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
so i can give you like the 300 000 foot
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
view and i i don't think that's gonna be
 
00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:37.590 align:start position:0%
view and i i don't think that's gonna be
helpful

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
should be in no
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
good morning can we also bring in
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%

hi good morning um thank you for letting
us

00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
speak today on this bill i wanted to go
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
over a little bit of the history
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
last year um in house bill
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
1162 the parental reimbursement
 
00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.310 align:start position:0%
1162 the parental reimbursement
obligation

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
by bipartisan legislation was actually
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
um taken away there is no longer a
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
parental reimbursement
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
obligation and again that happened last
 
00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.269 align:start position:0%
obligation and again that happened last
year

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 2020 by bipartisan
 
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.549 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 2020 by bipartisan
legislation

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
the legislation we are proposing today
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
that you are looking at simply moves the
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
back to june of 2020 or
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
really july 1st 2020 it was supposed to
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
be effective on january 1st
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
2021. so
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
that's section 30. section 31
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
let's stop let's hold up there sure
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
so um this is this would be retroactive
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
so what i assume
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay so what i think this parental
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement was
 
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
as i recall was that we could go back
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
and try to do debt collection from
 
00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:03.909 align:start position:0%
and try to do debt collection from
parents

00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
to help recover some of the costs
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
associated with the child
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
services that we provided and that our
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
debt collection experience on this was
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
such that
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
we found that the cost of collection
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
greatly exceeded
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
the cost of or the amount that we were
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
able to obtain
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
so we were running a losing business
 
00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:26.470 align:start position:0%
so we were running a losing business
proposition

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
proposition
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
and and and so i'm guessing that you
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
guys just
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
halted it when you could in july 1
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
2020 and by passing this we're going
 
00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:36.630 align:start position:0%
2020 and by passing this we're going
back

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
and giving you guys permission to have
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
stopped early
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes that is a good summary correct
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
just to yes by one point though we
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a it was a a one to one
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
we weren't bringing in any money we
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
weren't losing money but we weren't
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
bringing in any money it cost as much to
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
run the program as what we were getting
 
00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.509 align:start position:0%
run the program as what we were getting
back

00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative weiler
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman i can remember
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
going way back that if a child was in
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
the dcyf detention center
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
and at the time was like a hundred
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
thousand a year if the child was there a
 
00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:18.630 align:start position:0%
thousand a year if the child was there a
year

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
or even six months there was a huge debt
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
of 50 or 100 000
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
and you know they would look at the
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
parents financial of
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh ability and get it
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
maybe come up with a payment of two or
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
three hundred dollars a month
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
and so it was like having another
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
mortgage so
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
we did that for a while and then there
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
were so many complaints
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
they knocked it down to okay you pay so
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
much a month
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
while the child is in the facility and
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
after that
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
the payments stop but i wonder if
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
maybe we overlook the fact that some
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
parents might have been carrying
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
what amounted to a second mortgage for
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 years so
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
does this relieve those parents that
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
might have been paying for for years and
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
years or
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
did we stop that already no that's a
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
good question
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what the section 31 would
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
allow us to do
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
it it would allow us to stop to motion
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
the court to stop those enforcement
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
orders so all those orders that are
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
so what the legislation did was it then
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
department you no longer have to
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
establish orders
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
as of this date and so section 30 is
 
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
as of this date and so section 30 is
asking

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
can we stop establishing order stop the
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
program as of
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
july 1st 2020 instead of january
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
1 2021 section 31
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
does allow us as you said to go back all
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
these we have
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
over a thousand orders so it would allow
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
us to petition the court and save this
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
unit no longer exists can we
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
stop um this collection and i have a
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons for that when you're
 
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.310 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons for that when you're
ready

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead you're on a roll thank you
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
um again once this position went away we
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
had about
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
six uh financial agents in
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
this unit they all left so this unit is
 
00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.030 align:start position:0%
this unit they all left so this unit is
now

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
the collections part of it is being um
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
handled by our administrative support
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
staff so we're really not
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
doing the active enforcement that we
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
were doing
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
we are simply collecting checks that
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is it leads to
 
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.069 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is it leads to
some

00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
inequity right so if we're not enforcing
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
orders of the people who
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay and we're just
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
collecting um there's a certain number
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
of people who aren't paying there's a
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
certain number of people
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
um who are and it uh
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
when running the numbers i looked
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
quickly last night about a third of our
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
cases are in delinquency
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
meaning those parents just aren't paying
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the staff right now to
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
bring them back to court to enforce
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
these orders
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure that the um
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the reasoning behind it
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
is even there if we brought
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
this to the court if the court would say
 
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:08.630 align:start position:0%
this to the court if the court would say
um

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
hey department the legislator changed
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
their minds they don't even want you
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
doing this program anymore why are you
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
asking me to enforce this so there's
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on sections 31
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
okay uh there's a question uh
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
no i i think there ought to be some way
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
we can tell parents
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know you didn't you didn't raise
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
this child responsibly
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
and this this was a way to get their
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
attention but
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
some of the irresponsible children had
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
irresponsible parents so
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
i don't notice we changed anything thank
 
00:36:52.839 --> 00:36:55.030 align:start position:0%
i don't notice we changed anything thank
you

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
all right uh well uh well thank you for
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
for for coming in uh francesca i
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know if you have
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
other things to talk about here we're
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
we're gonna go to section 33 now for a
 
00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:13.270 align:start position:0%
we're gonna go to section 33 now for a
discussion

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
and my note here says the governor's
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
office wanted
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
replacement language and that was
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
completed over the weekend
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
so i think what we're seeing on the
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
screen is the original
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
hb2 language is is was the
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
did we receive replacement language to
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
this that you know of mr ripple
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
um i don't you know i don't think so but
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
karen correct me if i'm wrong maybe you
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
sent me something that i didn't
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
notice i did but i probably sent you
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
yes i did uh draft language i had it
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
approved by the governor's office and
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
sent it over all right i'll find that
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
and send out
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
well go ahead and take a moment
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
and see if between the two of you you
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
can find a way to get it on the screen
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
and and then if anyone from the
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
governor's office has joined us since we
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh asked them to um please raise your
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.839 --> 00:38:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
notice

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
well i see matt uh is there so uh one
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
once once we look at 33
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay mr ripple you keep keep doing that
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have to change your screen for
 
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.030 align:start position:0%
you don't have to change your screen for
us

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
to keep working on that and if mr malou
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak i can ask him a
 
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.150 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak i can ask him a
question

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
yep and i'll bring him in and just stay
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
on finding the updated 33.
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
so so mr mellow and i'm still not saying
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
your last name
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
correctly i have no french in me
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
whatsoever i'm sorry
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh matt uh
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
we were talking about uh
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 30
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
house bill 26
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 section 26
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
and this is one uh i don't know if you
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
know it offhand
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
but it gave the dhhs some flexibility in
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
moving monies around from personnel
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
lines to other lines
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
and that typically we would put an
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
expiration date on that
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
of the end of the biennium and we have
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
word that the governor's office wanted
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
to go with the january 1
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
2023 date for that
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
expiration of authority do you recall
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
that can you
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
explain to us what your reasoning was
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question uh this
 
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.470 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question uh this
section

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
is a prospective repeal that was first
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
passed in senate bill
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
580 from 2018.
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature during the last budget
 
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.630 align:start position:0%
the legislature during the last budget
process

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
opted to extend that prospective repeal
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
for another biennium
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
what hb2 does it extends it once again
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
for 18 months if
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature no longer wants to
 
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.710 align:start position:0%
the legislature no longer wants to
repeal

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
this transfer authority i would argue
 
00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:04.150 align:start position:0%
this transfer authority i would argue
that

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
we should eliminate the prospective
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
repeal entirely
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
if that's the prerogative but the
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
governor's office our position was that
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
it would take effect
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
within this biennium rather than
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
continuing to
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
kick that date two years out at a time
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
so so thank you for that background
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
while you were
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
um while we were asking for you to come
 
00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.550 align:start position:0%
um while we were asking for you to come
in

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
one of the observations we made and i i
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
want to see if you share this thought
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
is that in a period
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
of constrained budgets
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
this authority to transfer
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
gives the dhhs leadership
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
some flexibility that could help them
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
navigate through
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
budget constraints that is correct
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards and i can't
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
why this bill was brought forward in
 
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
why this bill was brought forward in
2018

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
2018
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
but it did it did become law
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
right so clearly at one point this
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
legislature believed that this transfer
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
authority should sunset
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then again the legislature
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
subsequently delayed that by two years
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh we've even proposed to delay it
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
another 18 months
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right that the
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
department does utilize this unique
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
transfer authority
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
to move money between class lines in a
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
way that other agencies aren't able to
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
and during a constrained budget session
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
like the one we're in
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
that may be worthwhile what i would
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
argue is if the legislature's
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
prerogative is to remove this
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
prospective repeal
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
right to delay this prospective repeal
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
yet again
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
for a whole biennium it probably
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
warrants a conversation as to whether or
 
00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:55.990 align:start position:0%
warrants a conversation as to whether or
not

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
this provision of law should remain on
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
the books if it does not appear that it
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
will ever actually
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
take effect okay will you
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh take a question from representative
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
wallner be happy to
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you chairman and
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you matt for being here
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
um i wondered why you picked 18 months
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
instead of the full biennium
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
so our and this was something of debate
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
right we wanted to make sure the
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
department did have
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
a glide path to adopt to
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
losing this transfer authority you could
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
argue that it should be
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
the start of any given fiscal year
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
our thinking was that by picking january
 
00:43:39.119 --> 00:43:40.309 align:start position:0%
our thinking was that by picking january
1st

00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
1st
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
if it did become apparent that this was
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
a serious issue for the department to
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
manage through
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
by not having this transfer authority
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
our thinking was that the legislature
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
would be in session at that point
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
and could take quick action to reverse
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
that repeal
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
if necessary if you do it on july 1
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature is not in session in
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
most years and let's hope we're not in
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
session come july 1 this year either
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
there's less of a window of opportunity
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
to rectify the issue
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
if it becomes operationally difficult
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
for the department so that was our
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
thinking in picking january 1st
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
and again the intention of putting this
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
language into hb2 was that
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
if this law is going to continue to
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
exist on the books it should take effect
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
rather than just kicking it out a whole
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
biennium you know year after year if you
 
00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:33.109 align:start position:0%
biennium you know year after year if you
will

00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay i just wouldn't we be
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
in session and doing the budget
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
during that period of january to
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
to june and at that point evaluate
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not we wanted to include it
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature would be until june
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
and as part of that right as you're
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
going through the budget for the next
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
you're experiencing in real time whether
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
or not this is actually a substantial
 
00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:10.790 align:start position:0%
or not this is actually a substantial
issue

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
or not right obviously the legislature
 
00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:15.030 align:start position:0%
or not right obviously the legislature
could

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
reverse this through a bill that is not
 
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.270 align:start position:0%
reverse this through a bill that is not
hb2

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
i lost you yeah you're having some audio
 
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.190 align:start position:0%
i lost you yeah you're having some audio
issues

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think he's answering my
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you matt thank you for being
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
here okay
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for matt
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh i i think your hands still up but you
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
don't have a follow-up representative
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
no i'm i'm all right
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
so uh uh and mr chairman just one last
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
thing if i may
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
yes sir is that again if the legislature
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
does want to extend this for the full
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
biennium that's certainly within your
 
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.270 align:start position:0%
biennium that's certainly within your
prerogative

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
prerogative
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
what i would say is maybe we eliminate
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
the prospective repeal
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
and i know karen at hhs has articulated
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
why this is important to the department
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh and i think just decide which
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
direction we went ahead and
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
just decided to you know row in the same
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
direction at that point
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
okay i i'm gonna listen to the committee
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
members that have been around
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
finance longer than i have i i happen to
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
be predisposed to accepting the
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
governor's recommendation on this but
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm open to
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
a discussion there so um
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple were you able to find the
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
new language and maybe with matt here
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
since we were saying that the governor's
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
office looked at this language and
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
improved replacement language he could
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay karen can you explain uh
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
what you remember about why we thought
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
the the existing language in hb2 needed
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
this amendment and what this amendment
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
is trying to do
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
sure so the existing language and hb2
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
has a lot of unintended consequences
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
um going back to tanf
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
and the general funds being budgeted for
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
the moe all across the department if it
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
if it's not um spent then we need to
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
move it and then we would replace it
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
with a federal fund and the way that
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
that language was written
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
we would then have to lapse the general
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
fund and we wouldn't have it available
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
for moe because
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
technically the federal funds supplanted
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
it and that's just a
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
one very small example um so when i
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh talked to the governor's office about
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
it they understood
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
my concerns and were willing to uh let
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
me propose
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
language that still uh met
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
what they were trying to obtain which
 
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:07.910 align:start position:0%
what they were trying to obtain which
was

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
um just more transparency around when we
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh may be accepting an additional
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
federal dollar that may offset
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
a general fund dollar um and then what
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
would happen with those general fund
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
dollars so
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
that's what this language does it puts
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
in a reporting requirement that when we
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
are doing a transfer or an exception
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
expend with fiscal committee
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
that uh we are reporting about
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
supplanted general fund dollars
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
um and reporting on how much of that is
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
anticipated to lapse versus
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
used for other purposes
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
all right so do we see
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
a a longer term opportunity to put any
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
of this in an
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
rsa or is this something that's going to
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
live forever in an hb2
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
so i mean certainly my preference where
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is the first time
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
we we've done this would be to see how
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
it goes because i don't
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
we haven't exactly figured out how we're
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to report on it
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
and what questions might come up so my
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be one biennium with it
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
as it is let's see
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
how the reporting goes what questions
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee might have
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
and then refine it if we need to
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
i've forgotten which section this
 
00:49:23.359 --> 00:49:24.790 align:start position:0%
i've forgotten which section this
replaces

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
replaces
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
so uh matt while you're on with us
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
do you do you have any uh
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
interest in revising or extending this
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
round's remarks
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
i would say that our office did consult
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
with uh karen
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
on this we do agree section 33 of hb2 as
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
drafted is problematic
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
and we would support revising it to be
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
the language that you see here on the
 
00:50:06.559 --> 00:50:08.069 align:start position:0%
the language that you see here on the
screen

00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
were there any other questions from the
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
um and let's just check real quick the
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
audience uh the the just to see if there
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
are any hands up i i doubt if there
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh are there any i don't see any hands
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
up so
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh so i would entertain a motion at this
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
point to accept the draft language as
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
shown on the screen
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
as replacement language for section 33
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
in the zero second and then there's a
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
second uh moved by
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
irf seconded by wyler
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh would the clerk take a
 
00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:07.270 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh would the clerk take a
roll

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
you're muted okay on the
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
question to amend section 33
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
as shown on house bill 2
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
is to accept the amendment
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative earth
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative weiler votes yes
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative bean yes
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative walder yes
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren yes
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative rogers yes representative
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
edwards yes mr chairman the vote is 7-0
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
to amend
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
very good thank you um
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
all right so where are we we are
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
ready to take a look at section 38.
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
yep so let me bring that up um while i'm
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
doing that just so you know i am going
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
to have ols draft
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
that language that you just just
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
accepted in the form of a formal
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
amendment with an amendment number and
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
everything so once that
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
i'll bring it in uh bring it in for the
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
committee to look at
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
right i i think
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
technically what you just told me is we
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
should have done it the other way i
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
should ask you to make get ols to make
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
that amendment and then we'd vote on a
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
formal amendment
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
well yes but i didn't tell you that in
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
time so oh you've told me before i just
 
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.470 align:start position:0%
time so oh you've told me before i just
uh

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
i need to make the same mistake two or
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
three times before i remember so
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
so my note on 38
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
said this seems like a committee bill or
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
should be under a current program
 
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.750 align:start position:0%
should be under a current program
already

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
why is this a section hb2 section
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
the the governor's office may be
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
thinking this is a one-time
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
deal and maybe it was realized too late
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
to put into hb1 and so my question was
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
do we drop it from hb2 or do we accept
 
00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.230 align:start position:0%
do we drop it from hb2 or do we accept
it

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:19.030 align:start position:0%
it
so

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
so this was a proposal that i think
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
allowed care coordination out in the
 
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.230 align:start position:0%
allowed care coordination out in the
community

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
by funding for an additional period of
 
00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:30.870 align:start position:0%
by funding for an additional period of
time

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
the transmission of what is called an
 
00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:34.150 align:start position:0%
the transmission of what is called an
eight

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
adt transaction or event
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
out to receiving information systems
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
so that they would know if there was a
 
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.230 align:start position:0%
so that they would know if there was a
discharge

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
discharge
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
and they would know that a patient was
 
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.950 align:start position:0%
and they would know that a patient was
re-entering

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
re-entering
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
or transferring into their community
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the sum needed to continue those adt
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
transactions was two hundred thousand
 
00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:03.910 align:start position:0%
transactions was two hundred thousand
dollars

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
and it didn't find and this is 200 000
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
that did not
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
find its way into hb1
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
so um so is that an is that a accurate
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding yes
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
so this is something that we could move
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i i because the program exists
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
right you're already doing the adt
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
transactions so this is just a
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
funding of an ongoing operation
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
so that we could we could drop it and
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
and care and need to worry about it is
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
something that's already
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
potentially funded or needs additional
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
funds for hb1
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
correct the 200 000 would need to be in
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
hv1 it would be
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
in the bureau of information services
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
budget and class 37
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
i believe so you'll help us find that
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
line item
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
later again please when i'm able to look
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
at a spreadsheet maybe
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
but um all right so
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh is there any are there questions from
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
on this i mean i think the momentum on
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
this is that we want to delete this from
 
00:55:26.079 --> 00:55:27.829 align:start position:0%
this is that we want to delete this from
hb2

00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
because this is a this is an operational
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
item this program's already in operation
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
and this is just funds that are
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
can need to be allocated internally to
 
00:55:38.559 --> 00:55:39.109 align:start position:0%
can need to be allocated internally to
this

00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any questions um uh dave
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
wetters is he coming in today or is that
 
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.589 align:start position:0%
wetters is he coming in today or is that
tomorrow

00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
so that's tomorrow um they so he wants
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
to bring
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner for doit with him as
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
well and so they're uh
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
available between 10 and 12 tomorrow and
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure exactly what the plan is
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow i know there's also a
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee meeting
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
um so i don't know if we could do it
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
closer to 10
 
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:15.270 align:start position:0%
closer to 10
um

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
i was just thinking in my head whether
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
we should go ahead and
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
take a vote on this now right or wait
 
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:23.430 align:start position:0%
take a vote on this now right or wait
for

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
his input but i it seems pretty
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
straightforward to me
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
um i i would entertain a motion to
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh delete section 38 from hb 2.
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
some of this ripple mr ripple wants to
 
00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:37.910 align:start position:0%
some of this ripple mr ripple wants to
mr

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
mr
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
wants to change their name i'm sorry
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
before you continue with that i
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that deleting anything
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
as well as changing anything would also
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
require an ols amendment because
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
in both cases you're amending the bill
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay so um do you want to
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
take an action then to to draft an
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to delete section 38 please
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then we can vote on it amendments
 
00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.510 align:start position:0%
and then we can vote on it amendments
ready

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative do you have a
 
00:57:08.319 --> 00:57:09.190 align:start position:0%
yes representative do you have a
question

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes i do so is the uh proposal here to
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
delete it from house bill 2 and we will
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
add it in house bill 1.
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
that it will be cover okay so the first
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
half of that is
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
is literally correct and i agree with it
 
00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:25.990 align:start position:0%
is literally correct and i agree with it
it

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
would be this is an operational expense
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
of an ongoing existing
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
program and and should be funded within
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
hb1 when they built hb1
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
apparently they overlooked the funding
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
requirements for this
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
and so so separately they are asking
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
us to put 200 000 into a line item
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
in hb1 to support this ongoing program
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not in the governor's proposal
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's not in
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
i mean you could argue that it's in the
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
fy21 base because
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh it is an ongoing program
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
but but it does appear to be a new
 
00:58:10.079 --> 00:58:11.190 align:start position:0%
but but it does appear to be a new
demand

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
for resources that is not currently
 
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.270 align:start position:0%
for resources that is not currently
reflected

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
reflected
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget proposal
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question do you
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
well i guess i yes i do i i guess i
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
don't quite understand i went
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
so if we take it out of here and we
 
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.870 align:start position:0%
so if we take it out of here and we
don't

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
do an amendment to house bill one that
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
adds it in
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
then they've lost it well are they
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
we just have talked about giving them an
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
authority to reprogram pretty
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
generously within line items
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
so so they would be in a situation
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
of a budget constraint where they would
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
need to make priorities and maybe
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
move some money around to cover this
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
program that
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
sounded like this program was pretty
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
important so maybe it has a high enough
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
priority to compete well
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
well i think to me it feels like
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
we have to decide do we want to fund
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
this program or don't we and this is the
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
sort of the spot if we take it out of
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
here and we don't put it in one
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
then the decision was that we didn't
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
want to fund it
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
if we want to fund it and we want to put
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
it where it
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
approp should be appropriately then we
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
have to do something in house bill one
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
an amendment to house bill one to make
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
sure this money goes over to
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
house bill one uh one otherwise the
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
decision now
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
if we don't do the if we don't do
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
something in house bill one the decision
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
is we decided we didn't want to fund
 
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.069 align:start position:0%
is we decided we didn't want to fund
this

00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
particular item well that we didn't want
 
00:59:50.799 --> 00:59:51.510 align:start position:0%
particular item well that we didn't want
to

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
provide dedicated funding we're not
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
telling them not to fund it either
 
00:59:56.319 --> 00:59:56.630 align:start position:0%
telling them not to fund it either
though

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
so we're sort of uh would allow an
 
00:59:59.520 --> 00:59:59.990 align:start position:0%
so we're sort of uh would allow an
internal

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
internal
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
transfer to cover it based on a
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
departmental priority but
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
so submit we're not making any decision
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
today because as mr ripple correctly
 
01:00:08.799 --> 01:00:09.990 align:start position:0%
today because as mr ripple correctly
stated

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
stated
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
he needs to draft an amendment with ols
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to take a vote
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
on what to do with section 38 until we
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
have an amendment
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
and then we can discuss this again so
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
but so ms rounds would you
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
would you add this topic to mr
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
watters to come in and tell us about
 
01:00:30.079 --> 01:00:31.750 align:start position:0%
watters to come in and tell us about
because

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
i want to understand that two hundred
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
thousand is that a hundred thousand a
 
01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:35.750 align:start position:0%
thousand is that a hundred thousand a
year

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that just seems like a boatload of
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
money for
 
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
an i.t system that's already set up to
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
trigger hl7 messages i don't see that
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
as being in i don't i don't understand
 
01:00:46.799 --> 01:00:47.510 align:start position:0%
as being in i don't i don't understand
an

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
incremental cost to an existing it
 
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.349 align:start position:0%
incremental cost to an existing it
function

01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
that should cost tens of dollars
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
not 200 000 so
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
so i i if he could come back and explain
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
why it would cost so much to maintain a
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
hl7 transaction that'd be great
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes i will ask him to also speak to that
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative and i wasn't ignoring you
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
if you have a question
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
all right so we're gonna we're gonna
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
defer 38 and we're going
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
to add conversation from mr rutter's to
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
give us
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
more details on on justifying 200
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
i'm ready to move on to
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
section 39. this is uh the section that
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative wallner
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
opened up to us on monday i i don't
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
anyone has submitted a draft
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
to uh mr ripple for us to vote on
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
in this case you did because you did
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
discuss it the other day and there was
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
some discussion about removing the
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
section entirely i did have an amendment
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
drafted that i just literally just got
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
from ols
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
to delete this section so if you were so
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
inclined you could vote on that
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay it's good to have that flexibility
 
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:12.630 align:start position:0%
okay it's good to have that flexibility
so

01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
so representative walner uh would you
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
would you remind us what we said on
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
monday and what your current thinking is
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
why i think that what we
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
talked about what um was your suggestion
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
really actually of
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
of taking it out at this time and in
 
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:32.870 align:start position:0%
of taking it out at this time and in
april

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
april
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
some point in april when we have a
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
little more time
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
basically having a public information
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
session where people can come in and
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
talk to us about this section
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
so that the house finance committee
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
will have information to move forward i
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
mean i think that
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
my assumption was that we felt like
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of information we needed
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
and we our time was getting was getting
 
01:03:00.079 --> 01:03:00.630 align:start position:0%
and we our time was getting was getting
short

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
short
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
so um that that was a suggestion you
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
brought in and i thought it sort of made
 
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.150 align:start position:0%
brought in and i thought it sort of made
sense

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
and there like i said there were a
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
number of bills floating around over the
 
01:03:11.599 --> 01:03:12.549 align:start position:0%
number of bills floating around over the
last

01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
three or four years about this and this
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
has been in the budget before
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
and actually it's non-lapsing money from
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
the 20 from the 2021 budget
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
that was in this line and this does
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
this particular proposal has
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
bonding in the operating budget and i
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
is a serious one for the legislature to
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
start down that
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
down that path we've been there before
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
all right so representative do you have
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
follow-on questions well i just wanted
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
to know
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that i have written is
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
senate bill 156
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
kevin can you refresh us on what that
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
bill does please
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 156 i believe inserted into
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
the language that was in the trail
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
bill from two years ago a provision to
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
prevent the department from contracting
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
with a for-profit
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
prison company or run the facility
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
and i would also second what
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative walner said i think we
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
have had this discussion already
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
but we need to remind ourselves that
 
01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.230 align:start position:0%
but we need to remind ourselves that
we're

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
a little concerned that this isn't going
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
through the capital budget process in
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
public works
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
i think representative rogers also
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
pointed out that she didn't think it
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
had been properly or fully coordinated
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
with the city of concord
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
and and that that struck me as something
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
that ought to be done
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
so um okay
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
so i i think we should entertain a
 
01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.069 align:start position:0%
so i i think we should entertain a
motion

01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
to can you show the amendment on the
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
screen mr ripple
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
yep let me just bring that up oh there's
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative rogers would you go ahead
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
and while you're bringing that on the
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
screen representative rogers do you have
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to comment you talked
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
about the city i did in fact talk to the
 
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.029 align:start position:0%
about the city i did in fact talk to the
mayor

01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
mayor
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
and um he said that neither he nor the
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
city manager had been contacted about
 
01:05:25.599 --> 01:05:26.069 align:start position:0%
city manager had been contacted about
this

01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
and they wanted they would would very
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
much like to be contacted and talk
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
have some involvement with the planning
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
of this and where
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
what's going on with it so i would hope
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
that um the department would make sure
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
so if we could send a strong message to
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't need to necessarily be in
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment but i would hope that um
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
you as the chairman of this division
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
might help send a
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
a strong message to the department that
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's something we'd like to see happen
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay well i i think with the department
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
listening in on the hearing and
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
and i think hearing us all basically say
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
after this vote they may have a
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
a big part of the message thank you very
 
01:06:11.119 --> 01:06:13.510 align:start position:0%
a big part of the message thank you very
much

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
there was a meeting scheduled for 316
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who it was with the city of
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
concord but
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
there was a meeting scheduled i don't
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
know that it happened but that was
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
the information that i got karen i would
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
just ask that somebody contact the mayor
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
in the city manager's office

35 uh
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
what was this about this was oh this is
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
a m study and having 10 million dollars
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think i've heard from his rounds that
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
this a
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
m report has been completed and that
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
we've been sent a copy
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
and that this is one of the big things
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
that i
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
have been wanting to read or look at but
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
i personally have not done that
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
can we confirm that this a
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
m report is completed and has been
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
emailed to us
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
is that is that is that true it has been
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
emailed to you and it's also posted on
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then uh for anyone who's looked at
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
it i'm just curious did
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
is that ten million forty three thousand
 
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.310 align:start position:0%
is that ten million forty three thousand
dollars

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
for the biennium is that backed up by
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
the report for the
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
people who have looked at the report or
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
or or is that
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
an estimate that needs to be refined do
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
we know
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
i don't remember seeing it specifically
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the report but saw it later in
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
another form a report
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
was actually four reports and
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
you know there was a lot of repetition
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
in all of them but
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
there were several places where they
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
showed savings
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
if the department would would file their
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
paperwork a little differently
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
so they could get more federal funds and
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask miss rounds who have
 
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:17.910 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask miss rounds who have
maybe

01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
done more thorough adding up of all
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
those little sections
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
if those savings if they were
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
followed would amount to at least 10
 
01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:32.149 align:start position:0%
followed would amount to at least 10
million

01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
i uh not
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
let's be fair to you we're not really
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
discussing this until
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow i think yeah i think so you got
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
24 hours to kind of
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
stick your nose into that yeah let me
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
let me think about it
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
let me think about it you understand the
 
01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.310 align:start position:0%
let me think about it you understand the
question

01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
i do i do and i it i think it applies to
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of different sections of
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
let me let me think i representative
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
weiler asked very about a very specific
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
finding but i think
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
all of the findings there's definitely
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
an roi but i'd rather wait till tomorrow
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
when i have some of the am
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
a m folks available um so they can
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
talk to you about what they found
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
because they they were really
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
independent in their review
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative follow-up yeah
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
and also you have to uh figure out where
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
the overlap is
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
because here's two different sections
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
first time period and then two different
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
sections for the second time period
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
you know the recommendations in the in
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
the first section for the first time
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
period the same as the
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations in the second report on
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
the same time period i
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have the patience to read all the
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
many pages in the detail and make notes
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
in the margin but i was just kind of
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
glancing through and i did see that
 
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
there was quite a bit of repetition
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
in what i saw with two reports in each
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
of the two time periods thank you
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
chair if you would like what uh what we
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
could do starting off tomorrow is have a
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
m give like a five minute overview of of
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
and and their what they reviewed
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
if that would be helpful you know it
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
would i
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
just to talk about tomorrow i i
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
i i've told uh representative leon
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
already that section 34 would be
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
the first up in the batting order and
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm anticipating that that's probably in
 
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
going to take at least an hour right
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
there so
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to give the a m people a
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
heads up
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
it it's probably about 10 30 at the
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
earliest before we
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
we'd come to 35 okay and it'll probably
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
be a little after that because we have
 
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.189 align:start position:0%
be a little after that because we have
to

01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
talk to the mmis folks uh around that
 
01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:58.950 align:start position:0%
talk to the mmis folks uh around that
time

01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
next because that's the only time
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
they're available tomorrow oh this is
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
really good to know
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
you should tell me when i have to talk
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
to mmis
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
yeah it should be right after 34. we
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
should do
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
those folks they're going to join at 10
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
o'clock so they'll be available
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
as soon as we're done with 34.
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
we may have to we may have to recess 34
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i want to do that but
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
when they're available um
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
okay so so so
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
with representative weiler's question
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
about an
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
roi being associated with some of this
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
if it's going if it's going to reduce
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
produce a net reduction like in fy 23
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
where yeah yes it's about 5 million
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
but we're going to get an roi of 3
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
million you're only asking for two
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
million of new cash
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
in fy 23 that's just an example
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
but if it's if it's that kind of
 
01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.030 align:start position:0%
but if it's if it's that kind of
analysis

01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
then would you make sure that we
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
understand the net
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
because we're we're already into the
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
gray zone where we're
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
we're looking for money i can absolutely
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
we want to be sure that those
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations can in fact
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
be accomplished without finding out from
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
the department that it's impossible to
 
01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.149 align:start position:0%
the department that it's impossible to
do

01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
understood so
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a preview of coming
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
attractions on section 35
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so let's go to section
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
now these grants to senior citizens this
 
01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.070 align:start position:0%
now these grants to senior citizens this
feels

01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
feels
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
like it's an existing program
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
i i thought we talked uh
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the long-term care supports about a
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
program that had this function
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
supporting services to combat struggles
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
with mental health and social isolation
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to grants for
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
safety upgrades and other capital
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
improvements to improve their facilities
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
i i is so so i guess tomorrow i would
 
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:29.590 align:start position:0%
i i is so so i guess tomorrow i would
like

01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
confirmation of whether or not this is a
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
new program
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
or an existing program and if it's an
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
existing program
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
is this capital money because we're
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
talking about capital improvements
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
and if it's operating money in an
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
existing program why isn't it already in
 
01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.990 align:start position:0%
existing program why isn't it already in
hb1

01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
did you follow all that yes and i think
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
this is one that you
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
as a committee had a question out to the
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
governor's office on because the
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
governor's office added this provision
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
so we really needed them to speak to it
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
so let's
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
let's see what my note says why is this
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
a sec
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
hb section 852 section the governor's
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
office may be looking at this as a
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
one-time thing
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
and if we don't can we ask him to come
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
back at around
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh one o'clock tomorrow to talk to this
 
01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.070 align:start position:0%
uh one o'clock tomorrow to talk to this
section

01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
he's not in the audience but yes i can
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:47.430 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:48.709 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry i didn't hear that which
 
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:52.870 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry i didn't hear that which
section

01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
oh section 41. i i said 43 because my
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
eye is
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
my left eye is problematic and was
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
so section 43 uh i have meant to follow
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
up with representative mcquatt mcguire
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
because she said that historically there
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
was a reason to not
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
move the controlled drug prescription
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
health and safety program into dhhs
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and and so
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
this hb2 could potentially be
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
problematic because it's circumventing
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh a specific legislative decision from
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
a year or two ago i think
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
so so this is my reminder to contact
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire representative
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
norgren it looks like you may want to
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
say something
 
01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:52.790 align:start position:0%
say something
no

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
okay i don't i i'm going to assume that
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
i i misinterpreted your hand motion
 
01:19:08.719 --> 01:19:09.990 align:start position:0%
i i misinterpreted your hand motion
there

01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative walter
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
is division one looking at this section
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh also one originally had the section
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
but they asked
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh division three to take it instead
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay so they don't have it they didn't
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
make any
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
they didn't make any comments on it or
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
give us
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
any ideas about how they felt about it
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any comments from
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
division one
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna try to get
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
some background from
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcguire and then rep
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
ms rounds if you could
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh re-remember the the the argument the
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh institutional argument for moving it
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
that'd be great
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative roller your hand is
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
still up do you have a follow-up
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
ma'am i do have a question that i want
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
to ask you
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
when we get through um all of these
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
sections okay representative norgren do
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
yes yeah i think i had a note that the
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
question was about the office of
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
professional licensing in division one
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that's
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
what clarification would you like made
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
help me understand that
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think the issue was division one deals
 
01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.550 align:start position:0%
i think the issue was division one deals
with

01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensing so
 
01:20:45.679 --> 01:20:45.990 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensing so
the

01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
question that i had written was
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
should they have seen this and i guess
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's something we're going to
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
check on thank you i think i think the
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
answer i just heard from
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative weiler was that that they
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
they cons that the division one chair
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
considered this and asked that division
 
01:21:06.159 --> 01:21:06.709 align:start position:0%
considered this and asked that division
three

01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
take the lead on it and so they've not
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
come to any determination because
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
they passed it to us is that is that a
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
correct assumption
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
um is this a good time to take your
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
question representative walner
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
well when i asked a question you can
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
tell me if it's a good time or not
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay so um i do i have an amendment
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
um that i would like to bring in it's a
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
house to
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
um house bill 2 amendment
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
what would be the appropriate time for
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
so let me just check its status if as
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
mr ripple had an opportunity to get ols
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
to pro
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
to create amendment document for us to
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
yes he has does it
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
address a specific section that's
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
already in hb2 or does it
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
add something it really addresses a
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
section that's in hb
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
one but i we
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
we sort of went back and forth mr ripple
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i talked about whether it should be
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
in house bill one or house bill two
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
um i think we came down on the side of
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
but would be open to hearing other
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
people's ideas about it
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
it has to do with a line in house bill
 
01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.310 align:start position:0%
it has to do with a line in house bill
1.

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
i think if you're ready to talk about it
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
we could talk about it
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
now but uh let me check with
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative weiler he's got his hand
 
01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:45.030 align:start position:0%
representative weiler he's got his hand
up

01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
and yeah representative weiler
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
no i just i thought i lowered it thank
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
you all right
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to put you on the spot
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
though representative walter if you're
 
01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:55.830 align:start position:0%
though representative walter if you're
not

01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
prepared in this instant to talk about
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
it we can
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i just the only thing i need to
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
find is the page
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1 because we'll have to
 
01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:10.550 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1 because we'll have to
use

01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
i think to make to have this make sense
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
people will need to use both documents
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
so if you want to do it after lunch i
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
can have all the um
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
right lines and everything ready
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i want to continue previewing
 
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.510 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i want to continue previewing
tomorrow

01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
to talk about sections 24 25 106
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
110. so if you happen to be able to get
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
ready to talk about it while we're doing
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
the previews
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know let me know and and and we'll
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
offer questions okay good thank you
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative rogers you have your hand
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
up yes um i have an interest also
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
in that um i believe i'm not positive
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
but i believe that um
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
we had all talked about the sununu
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
center and possibly amending
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
something there but um there again i
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
believe that would go in house bill 2
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure where in
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
um in house bill 1
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
what what amount we're using as our base
 
01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.510 align:start position:0%
what what amount we're using as our base
amount

01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering if if
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
you or representative earth could maybe
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
explain to me
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
where or how i can find out what base
 
01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.310 align:start position:0%
where or how i can find out what base
amount

01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
for a figure we're using for the sununu
 
01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.709 align:start position:0%
for a figure we're using for the sununu
center

01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
if we're using the 12.5 million if we're
 
01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.709 align:start position:0%
if we're using the 12.5 million if we're
using

01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
using
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
14.5 if we're using less than that or
 
01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.430 align:start position:0%
14.5 if we're using less than that or
whatever

01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
and um if you or anyone else has
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
has got an amendment or somebody should
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
be working on amendment or
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
where we stand on that so i'm kind of
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
throwing open that question
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
while we're previewing future actions on
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay so the most signifi we can do all
 
01:24:59.110 --> 01:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
of that the the biggest
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
chunk of what you said that has the
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
biggest impact i think is
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh the question has anyone done
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
an hb2 amendment related to the sununu
 
01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.550 align:start position:0%
an hb2 amendment related to the sununu
center

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you i'm not aware of any
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh if uh representative weiler sir
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
do you have a comment on that not on the
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
sununu senate per se i think we should
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
put something in there to to give
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
and then shut it down and give them a
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
year to figure out what they need and
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
then cut the budget way down
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
so that they realize we're serious but
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
we're going back to
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh number 41 we need to alert
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
hhs because this would be a whole
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh au or uh
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
appropriating unit you have to have all
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
the figure out how many people they'd
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
need and all that sort of thing and it
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
would be a whole page in hb1
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
so we've got to give them a heads up if
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
accept this because it basically belongs
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
in hb1 with a new au
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
once we accept it thank you
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh i i'm assuming that it would
 
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.229 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh i i'm assuming that it would
be

01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
total over to the overall budget of the
 
01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:13.350 align:start position:0%
total over to the overall budget of the
state

01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
it would be budget neutral because it's
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
an existing program
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
that would be laterally moved into dhhs
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh changing the finances would be
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
mechanics that would happen in
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
background is
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
rounds do you have a comment about that
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i had to step away for for
 
01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.910 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i had to step away for for
okay

01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
okay so so we of course we named you
 
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
while you were away
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
the uh so the i think to
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
phrase representative weiler's comment
 
01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:55.590 align:start position:0%
phrase representative weiler's comment
is

01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
if we accept section 41 that would cause
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
dhhs to need to create new accounting
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
units and
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
codes and and it would have to be in hb1
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
and and my assumption is that this is
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
an existing program that and all of the
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
manpower and money
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
is would be a lateral over
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh later as kind of an administrative
 
01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.629 align:start position:0%
uh later as kind of an administrative
action

01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's correct we we brought over the
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
program exactly
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
how it was um budgeted by oplc
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
and it is already uh showing in hb1
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
in our budget oh it already is so you're
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
assuming that we're going to approve
 
01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:38.790 align:start position:0%
assuming that we're going to approve
this

01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.310 align:start position:0%
this
correct

01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't then if this is removed
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
then um the budget would get moved back
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
all right do you have a follow-up
 
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.910 align:start position:0%
all right do you have a follow-up
representative

01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
oh you're saying all we have to do is
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
you scroll up uh mr ripple to
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is the county cap issue uh i think
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative irf has and i and
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
others have done a lot of work in this
 
01:28:38.239 --> 01:28:39.990 align:start position:0%
others have done a lot of work in this
area

01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
and we talked about it yesterday as we
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
were trying to do some ad backs
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
oh i'm going to stop myself
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative rogers you add two parts
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
to your question
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
we talked about the the sununu center
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
for just a moment but didn't finish it
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any hb2 recommendations
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
on on uh
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
on the sununu center and
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
and and at this point is there anyone in
 
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
that has asked mr ripple to draft
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
an hb2 for the sununu center or mr
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
ripple can you just tell us
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
yes or no if anyone's asked you to draft
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
such an amendment
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
no one has asked me to draft that
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
amendment as of now
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
okay so so so representative rogers if
 
01:29:29.199 --> 01:29:29.990 align:start position:0%
okay so so so representative rogers if
you

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
think that it needs to be amended and
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
you probably
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
would not be alone uh you know feel free
 
01:29:37.679 --> 01:29:38.390 align:start position:0%
would not be alone uh you know feel free
to

01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh get a group of people together to
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
figure out what you want to say and
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
and let's say it uh is that is that okay
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
all right thanks and then i think you
 
01:29:49.679 --> 01:29:50.629 align:start position:0%
all right thanks and then i think you
asked

01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
asked
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
another question in there about where
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
could you find the sununu center
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
in representative earth's document and i
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
believe if you
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh use that search bar in the upper
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
right hand corner to look at the
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
either its account code or the name
 
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.229 align:start position:0%
either its account code or the name
sununu

01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
sununu
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
it it should come up for you and and
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
i am assuming that the that the
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
the current baseline that would go into
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
our proposed hb1 amendment at this point
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so so not adjusted
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
for fy not not added to in 22 and 23
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
but just what they were at the end of fy
 
01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.470 align:start position:0%
but just what they were at the end of fy
21.

01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
21.
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative erf are you still there
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
i'm still here style okay can you
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
confirm my assumption
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
that for the sununu center uh
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
right now we're planning to maintain the
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
fy21 adjusted
 
01:30:54.080 --> 01:31:00.830 align:start position:0%
fy21 adjusted
baseline

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:10.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i guess the answer is yes that's the
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
plan we we didn't add any back yesterday
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
so using the algorithm
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
you used the the lower of the governor's
 
01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
number or fy21 and i assume the fy 21
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
was lower so that's the number that
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
we're planning on at this point
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
yes i'm now going i would apply the
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
algorithm that is correct but not sure
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
off top my head which way
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative weiler good comment
 
01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:46.790 align:start position:0%
representative weiler good comment
question

01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
mr joy wants a meeting later today
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
and uh he sent me a zoom lim link i
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
think he has a suggested amendment for
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
the sununu center
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
so we'll see what he's got thank you sir
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i asked him for an agenda for that 230
 
01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.310 align:start position:0%
i i asked him for an agenda for that 230
call

01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
and and he just said he wanted to clear
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
up some confusion
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
and i i was hoping for something more
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
specific than that but i guess we'll
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
find out at 2 30 what what he thinks
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
because i'm confused maybe maybe i'm the
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
first one to clear up
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
so representative rogers i belatedly did
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
we get to your
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh answers to your question um yes thank
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
so uh so section 24.
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
there's a whole discussion here that
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
we'll have tomorrow
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
on the county cap
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
and uh representative irf uh we talked
 
01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:42.950 align:start position:0%
and uh representative irf uh we talked
about

01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
it a bit yesterday uh i think
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
we are proposing
 
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
to do some add backs to
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
the this line item and that those add
 
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.590 align:start position:0%
the this line item and that those add
backs

01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
backs
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
would keep the rate of increase
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
at a three percent level we've talked
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
what it would cost at a two percent
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
level but
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
but i i think right now the proposal is
 
01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
but i i think right now the proposal is
is

01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between there two and three
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
percent and
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
with the idea that an hp2 could be
 
01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.470 align:start position:0%
with the idea that an hp2 could be
crafted

01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
crafted
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
to um to lock in future
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
growth at a three percent rate
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
is is that an accurate summation of your
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
proposed hb2
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
representative earth that we would keep
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
it at the hb2 line would say keep it at
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
three percent
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh we can go either way
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
um i thought we talked about low into
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
two percent but i am working with kevin
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
to get that amendment together
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
so we can send that out so people will
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
review it and then we can vote on it
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
but tomorrow you have time on the agenda
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
to talk about it in section
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
when we talk about section 24. i can
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
certainly speak to the amendment
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow for sure yes i assume you're
 
01:34:04.159 --> 01:34:04.550 align:start position:0%
tomorrow for sure yes i assume you're
kept

01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
kept
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
ready by them in fact they might already
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
have it i know kevin
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
and if ols can produce an amendment we
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
could maybe vote on it
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
and that is with ols now okay
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh section
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
25 thank you representative uh
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
prospective repeal regarding eligibility
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
of services extended
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay so we talked about this
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
this repeal i guess yesterday and uh
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and we have some more comments on
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
it but
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
but bottom line i think this section
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
25 becomes uh overcome by events
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
because uh in talking to representative
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
marsh of hhs
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
he says that he and he quoted it to me
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the the link to it
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
he quoted me rsa language
 
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
that will become effective on july 1
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
and that rsa language would make section
 
01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.550 align:start position:0%
and that rsa language would make section
25

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
move and therefore
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh it sounded like we could delete
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
section 25. so
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
8 25 and then we'll talk about it in
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
more detail tomorrow
 
01:35:48.719 --> 01:35:53.189 align:start position:0%
more detail tomorrow
sure

01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
i suppose everyone would be okay
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
deleting this if
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
in fact it's going into an rsa with a
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
projected effective date
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
so um all right so
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
um footnotes there's
 
01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh i think on the order of 32
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
footnotes uh and there's a
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
document that's floating around that
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
lists them
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
in sort of uh a grid format uh and shows
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
where the footnotes are throughout the
 
01:36:24.159 --> 01:36:26.470 align:start position:0%
where the footnotes are throughout the
hb1

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh and so there's just an issue of
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh we've we've we've looked at each
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
other and we like these footnotes
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple would you remind me if
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
those that footnote document you sent
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
that to all the
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
members right i believe i did
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
yes is that also listed
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
as its own document on the lba website
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
or would that have been considered
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
redundant since the footnotes are in hb1
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if we have that one on the
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
website or not let me take a look
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
so if you guys want to prepare yourself
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh you could look at the footnotes and
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
that document
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
and figure out if you want to accept the
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
footnotes or if you have
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
a change you want to make i i think this
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
morning i asked mr ripple
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
to get mr hoffman to create
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
a short list for us and i would describe
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
the shortlist
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
of being assuming fy 19
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
as the baseline what footnotes got added
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
in the current budget or and or
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
are proposed for the for the governor's
 
01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.350 align:start position:0%
are proposed for the for the governor's
budget

01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
and and mr hoffman has not had a chance
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
because that we just talked about that
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
this morning but
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
do you think you might have that
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
so we're showing you what document we're
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
yes this is just the one showing
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
footnotes in the governor's recommended
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and then
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
if you could go to sections 106 through
 
01:38:28.639 --> 01:38:29.669 align:start position:0%
if you could go to sections 106 through
110

01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
110
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
of the hb2
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
we we might actually do more than just
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
preview

01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
so sections 106 through 110 were
 
01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:49.830 align:start position:0%
so sections 106 through 110 were
submitted

01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
by uh the veterans home
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
um you know as as a
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
as a if i were a purist
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
i would be bothered by these sections
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
because there's a little bit of
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
internal redundancy where the same thing
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
is repeated in two of the
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
sections and that there's some
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
redundancy also
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
where one of these sections uh says
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
something that's already in the
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
footnotes so it's redundant in that
 
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.510 align:start position:0%
footnotes so it's redundant in that
regard

01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
regard
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
and so if i were
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
really fastidious it would be a big deal
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
to clean up 106 to 110
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
to get it clean and and lined up
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
but given all the work that mr ripple is
 
01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.669 align:start position:0%
but given all the work that mr ripple is
doing

01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if there's a lot of
 
01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if there's a lot of
benefit

01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
now to do it because it
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
it has it has no negative effect except
 
01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:50.310 align:start position:0%
it has it has no negative effect except
it's

01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary redundancy and and just
 
01:39:53.199 --> 01:39:53.669 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary redundancy and and just
not

01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
clean so um
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i'm saying is i think i
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
i would be willing to just accept
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
sections 106 through 1 and 110
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
knowing that they're not technically
 
01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.790 align:start position:0%
knowing that they're not technically
clean

01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
clean
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
but that they're not going to do any
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
harm it's okay
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
if anyone disagrees with that
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know this is actually a good time to
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
say something because
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
it would require mr ripple and uh lba to
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
do some
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
or the ols to do some work uh and the
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
value of that work i think is marginal
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
um are there any
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
so so let's try it this way i i would i
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
would entertain
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
emotion to accept sections 106
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
through 110 as written in hb2
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
i would move that are we really just
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
asking kevin though to produce the
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
amendment first and then actually vote
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
on it tomorrow
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
in this case we're just going to accept
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
106 through 110
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
and not ask him to do an amendment
 
01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:13.109 align:start position:0%
and not ask him to do an amendment
because

01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
second by representative weiler is there
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
a discussion
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
so so i i i'll discuss it just one more
 
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
time to summarize my thinking
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
106 through 110 are fine
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
if with them in hb2
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh it it it gives the veterans home
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
some flexibility from a technical
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
writing perspective there's some
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
redundancy that could be cropped
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
out of this but that redundancy isn't
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to cause us any problems in the
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
maybe it can be fixed next next time
 
01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:50.790 align:start position:0%
maybe it can be fixed next next time
around

01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
that's my discussion i i i'm predisposed
 
01:41:54.239 --> 01:41:54.709 align:start position:0%
that's my discussion i i i'm predisposed

while she was briefing it so i think we
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%

thoroughly but i think
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
in about four places on sections we're
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
anticipating talking about tomorrow four
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
or five places
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
we asked you specifically to to go drill
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%

okay so representative erf what are we
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
i just want to ask kevin a little one
 
01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.189 align:start position:0%
i just want to ask kevin a little one
question

01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet looks a little different
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
than this but i assume it's just the
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
same numbers looking differently
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes yes okay that's fine so
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
what i asked uh mr rebel to do was to go
 
01:48:20.159 --> 01:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
what i asked uh mr rebel to do was to go
as

01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
the other day he went through all of the
 
01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:24.870 align:start position:0%
the other day he went through all of the
accounts

01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
that had only federal funds and we
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
voted to accept those from the
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
and going through the budget there are
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
many other
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
accounts that do not have general funds
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
they might be
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
agency funds only they might be private
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
funds only they might be revolving funds
 
01:48:42.239 --> 01:48:42.709 align:start position:0%
funds only they might be revolving funds
only

01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
so i asked them to pick out all the
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
other accounts
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
that have no general funds in them so
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
that we could just consider them for
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
approval as the government or has
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
budgeted them
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
i have not had a chance to go through
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
the entire list yet but i was planning
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
later i think there are 32 of them
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
aren't there
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
or some number like that can you go to
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
32. and and when i looked at them
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
i i didn't see any issues but
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
i'm the most junior on the committee so
 
01:49:18.719 --> 01:49:19.990 align:start position:0%
i'm the most junior on the committee so
um

01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh i i i don't i don't see any issue
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
or a problem just accepting these
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh for our proposed
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
hb1 amendment accepting these into the
 
01:49:33.119 --> 01:49:36.229 align:start position:0%
hb1 amendment accepting these into the
amendment

01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
do you do you mr or representative erf
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
because you haven't had a chance to look
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
at the document you requested would you
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
like to defer
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
voting on it no if
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
does he need to prepare an amendment or
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
is this the amendment
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
well i think we're letting him know that
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
we want this to go into the hb1
 
01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:56.870 align:start position:0%
we want this to go into the hb1
amendment

01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
kind of like we did for the federal rule
 
01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.950 align:start position:0%
kind of like we did for the federal rule
right

01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
yeah no i'm fine with that if anybody
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
mr ripple what's the right way to tell
 
01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.030 align:start position:0%
mr ripple what's the right way to tell
you

01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
that we want this captured in house bill
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
one amendment
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
well i think there's no way to do it no
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
reason to do an amendment because in
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
this case you're approving accounts that
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
are already in
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
house bill one um but as you did with
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
the federal funds only accounts you
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
could certainly opt to vote to approve
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
this just to
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
just have a record of the committee's
 
01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.750 align:start position:0%
just have a record of the committee's
approval

01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
so uh i'd entertain a motion to accept
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
these 32 line items
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
into um the division three budget
 
01:50:40.719 --> 01:50:41.910 align:start position:0%
into um the division three budget
proposal

01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
so moved for a second
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative weiler uh mr
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
roll would you
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
ever excuse me uh is there any
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
discussion on this
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
i don't want to railroad anyone could
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
could we go back and look at the middle
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
of them so
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
like from 24 at the bottom to 12 or
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
whatever it's going to be
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay so so now you've i think you've
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
like glanced at all three pages
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
a little out of sequence but that's what
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
um i say the total is 319 million that's
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
neither general funding or federal funds
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's right there there are some big
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
ones on here for example the
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid enhancement tax revenue that's
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
budgeted for uncompensated care
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
up at the top and the equip revenue
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's budgeted for
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh in long-term supports and services
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
right below that so these aren't all
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
inconsequential accounts by any means
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
that makes sense those taxes are big
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
yep is there any more discussion
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the floor or any
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
more discussion not seeing any
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
mr clerk would you take a role the
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
motion is to
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
accept these 32 line items into the
 
01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:05.669 align:start position:0%
accept these 32 line items into the
division

01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%

ripple for putting that together and and
 
01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:38.310 align:start position:0%
ripple for putting that together and and
representative

01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
for for thinking about it i i like the
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
fact that we're shrinking
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of moving parts
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
i at this point have
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh think that we've accomplished what i
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
thought we
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
could accomplish today we have more time
 
01:52:58.320 --> 01:52:59.189 align:start position:0%
could accomplish today we have more time
available

01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
but because um tomorrow's going to be a
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
busy day and i think it's going to take
 
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
folks some some some independent time to
 
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:08.550 align:start position:0%
folks some some some independent time to
read

01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
read
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
and and get ready for some of these
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
things i i'd be
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'd be open to having folks have take a
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
an independent work afternoon and not be
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
in work session
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative walner do you have a
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
question well i am ready with my
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
amendment if
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm willing to wait until tomorrow i
 
01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:28.229 align:start position:0%
but i'm willing to wait until tomorrow i
i

01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
i want to do it now because tomorrow is
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
full if
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're not at lunch time now if you're
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
ready let's do it
 
01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay great okay so
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
you probably need to take um
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
look at your house bill one and go to
 
01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:48.550 align:start position:0%
look at your house bill one and go to
page

01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
950 of the governor's budget
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
mr can you share that just again i'd
 
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
like i like making sure we're all
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the same thing
 
01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:07.350 align:start position:0%
looking at the same thing
or

01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
normally i would uh take a bio break
 
01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:10.470 align:start position:0%
normally i would uh take a bio break
here

01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
but this feels like it's going to be
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
done in about 15 minutes
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
is that your estimate representative
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
walner or do you think it's going to be
 
01:54:17.119 --> 01:54:18.149 align:start position:0%
walner or do you think it's going to be
longer

01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
no unless there's a lot of questions i
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
can do it i think in 15 minutes
 
01:54:22.239 --> 01:54:35.350 align:start position:0%
can do it i think in 15 minutes
easy

01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay so if you go if you take a look at
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
class line 536 which is called
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
and i think if you remember the other
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
night at the public hearing
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
there were a number of people who spoke
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
to this line
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
so you can see that between um
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
20 21 and then with the governor
 
01:55:03.599 --> 01:55:05.030 align:start position:0%
20 21 and then with the governor
proposes

01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
proposes
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
quite an amount of less funding
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
and the real concern here from the child
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
care community is
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
that um you know during the pandemic
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's been really hard to gauge how many
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
children would be in child care how many
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
child care centers would be open
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
how many child care providers would be
 
01:55:32.070 --> 01:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
available so it has been
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
really hard to come up with um
 
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
estimates of how much child care is
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
going to be needed
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
when we get past this um how quickly
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
will we go back
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
to where we were before
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
um so my suggestion is
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
instead of adding money funds to the
 
01:55:55.199 --> 01:55:56.709 align:start position:0%
instead of adding money funds to the
line

01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'm suggesting a way that and we'll show
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
you the amendment
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
that i'm suggesting to a house bill too
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
i'm suggesting a way that
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
if we start drawing down the 26
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
million if we start drawing down
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
rapidly because people are going to go
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
back to work and i think
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
that's our goal we want people back to
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
work we we don't want people to
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
have to stay home and
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
it apply for state state services so
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
we want people to go back to work so as
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
that draws down
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
if we get to the point where um in
 
01:56:39.119 --> 01:56:40.550 align:start position:0%
if we get to the point where um in
either

01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
towards the end of 22 or towards the end
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
of 23
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
um there would be those lines would be
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
out of money
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden everyone would lose
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
their reimbursement
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
or have to go onto a wait list
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
that we have a way of
 
01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
monitoring that and then transferring
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
from the tanf reserve
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
money into those lines so let's maybe we
 
01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:11.910 align:start position:0%
money into those lines so let's maybe we
could

01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
show the um maybe we could show the
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:30.550 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
can you give us a second to read this i
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.840 --> 01:58:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay i i've read it is is are other
 
01:58:07.199 --> 01:58:07.830 align:start position:0%
okay i i've read it is is are other
people

01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
ready to for go ahead represent walnut
 
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.669 align:start position:0%
ready to for go ahead represent walnut
continue

01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay well um so
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
the tanf reserve fund there are only
 
01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:19.109 align:start position:0%
the tanf reserve fund there are only
certain

01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
things that you can use the tanf reserve
 
01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:22.709 align:start position:0%
things that you can use the tanf reserve
for

01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
and one of those is child care because
 
01:58:25.599 --> 01:58:27.430 align:start position:0%
and one of those is child care because
obviously

01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
getting families back to work and not on
 
01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:31.030 align:start position:0%
getting families back to work and not on
tanf

01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
tanf
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
temporary assistance to needy families
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
is a goal that
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
the department has but i think it is a
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
goal shared by
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
probably most of the people in new
 
01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:42.390 align:start position:0%
probably most of the people in new
hampshire

01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
that families should be working and
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
supporting their families so
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
without child care though if you have a
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
young family
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's really it's hard it's hard to do
 
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
the child care
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
employment related child care program
 
01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
helps families low income they're very
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
low income families
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
low income families be able to afford
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
child care it's a
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
they call it a scholarship program it's
 
01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
basically a subsidy
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
parents pay apart and the state state
 
01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
and federal government pay apart
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
um so what this does is basically
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
um safeguards that if we get to
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
like may and we're out of money
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have to say to families okay
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
no more money no more money for child
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
care so families
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
may lose their jobs they may have to
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
stay home i mean there's
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
and um i don't think that's what any of
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
us want to have a child care weightless
 
01:59:46.149 --> 01:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
families that needed care would have to
 
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
go on to wait list so i don't think
 
01:59:49.599 --> 01:59:50.070 align:start position:0%
go on to wait list so i don't think
that's

01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
what we want um and like i said
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
the tanf reserve is
 
02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
pretty specific about what um
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
what it can be used for and child care
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
is one of those things that the federal
 
02:00:05.119 --> 02:00:06.950 align:start position:0%
is one of those things that the federal
government

02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
encourages states to use
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
the tanf the tan of funding for
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
people have questions yeah oh yeah i
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
just was waiting for you to
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
finish with your okay so uh we have
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative weiler and then
 
02:00:30.070 --> 02:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
i just want to look and see the
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
amendment numbers to put it in the
 
02:00:33.119 --> 02:00:33.669 align:start position:0%
amendment numbers to put it in the
record

02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
plus i think this is brilliant so this
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't add
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
any new money it just is not available
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
for us thank you very much
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
no it does not ask for additional funds
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
it only asks that
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
if we start to run out and we you know
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
we may not run out the first year we
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
we have no way of predicting really how
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
many families or how quickly families
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
are going to go back to work
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
after having lost their employment or
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
been at home with their children during
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemics so
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
um i hear from providers that people are
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
already starting to come back and
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
they're starting to go back to work
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
and these i want to remind you that
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
these are people in jobs that are
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
hands-on jobs these are not people who
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
are going to stay home be on a computer
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
these are people who are nursing
 
02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:28.470 align:start position:0%
these are people who are nursing
assistants

02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
assistants
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
um aides in nursing homes
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
working in restaurants these are people
 
02:01:34.239 --> 02:01:34.950 align:start position:0%
working in restaurants these are people
who

02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
are going to really have to go out of
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
the home and get back to work
 
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think this is an outstanding amendment
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
the tanf fund was originally budgeted to
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
be down to i believe like 14 million
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
dollars by the end of this year
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
and because there hasn't been a need to
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
draw it down for the last couple years
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's much higher than that i think it's
 
02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
up over 40 million dollars
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
so the tana fund certainly has the
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
capacity to support what representative
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
walnut has proposed this is absolutely
 
02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:10.310 align:start position:0%
walnut has proposed this is absolutely
outstanding

02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the support thank you
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
well so representative wallner that
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
would all be too easy so
 
02:02:20.070 --> 02:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
so let me let me throw the frog in the
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
punch bowl
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
so so i i love the concept i think it's
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
a great idea
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
my only issue with it is it reads a
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
little bit like
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're signing a blank check and and just
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'll draw your attention to two words
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
that i would
 
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
like to have you consider changing um
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not asking you i don't tell
 
02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
any i'm just asking you to consider
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
changing them
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
and line four the word
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
fully so i would like to just see the
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
word fully
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
deleted to where it reads
 
02:02:59.589 --> 02:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
to to fund employment related child care
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
services to avoid a wait list
 
02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay the word fully
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
um is is just kind of
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
adds a level of extremeness that i don't
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
really know
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
the upper gauge to that the upper end
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to be extreme
 
02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to make sure there is
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
no wait list right
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
and and so uh then the other one
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
is on line five
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
towards the end of that blind five where
 
02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
you use the shall
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh i i would i would like to see the
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
word may
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
just because i i'm a little less
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
directive than some people i i would
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
like the management of dhhs
 
02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
to have the flexibility knowing what we
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
want them to do
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
but you know if for some reason they're
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
having problems i
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be compelling to do
 
02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't make sense
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
so so i i would i would ask that the
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
word shall
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
on line five be changed to may and
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
that the word fully on four
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
be deleted do you want to
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
i agree with fully i want to think about
 
02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:16.149 align:start position:0%
i agree with fully i want to think about
xiao

02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
xiao
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you that i've had
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
conversations with the department about
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
um they're they're very supportive of it
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
i have um also talked with um karen
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
rounds about it and she was supportive
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
and i talked to um the people who
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
managed the
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
um the child care program and they
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
they felt comfortable with it and um
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
especially as we go into these times
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
when we don't know what's going to
 
02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:45.830 align:start position:0%
when we don't know what's going to
happen

02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
for children needing to come back to
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
child care
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
so let me think about the may and xiao i
 
02:04:52.159 --> 02:04:53.350 align:start position:0%
so let me think about the may and xiao i
understand

02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
i under i certainly understand that and
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
i will
 
02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:00.149 align:start position:0%
i will
um

02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
i will um maybe get back to you at the
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
final tomorrow
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
or or just call me if if you if you come
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
to you know think about it because i'm
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
just giving you my first reaction
 
02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
also because i have not read the
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
language until 10 minutes ago so
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're getting sort of my first
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
blush response
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
so uh ms rounds do you do you have a
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
comment question yes um
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
i think it it goes to um
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
to your comment about um
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
about it not being a blank check if you
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
will there are federal
 
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
regulations as to how much tanf we can
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
transfer to cd
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
ccdf um so we
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh there would be about another six
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars over what has already
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
been budgeted in tanf that we could
 
02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
transfer to ccdf
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
um so you know i think a possibility
 
02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
would be to just add
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
um to the extent allowed by federal
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
regulation and that
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
i mean it wouldn't be a blank check
 
02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
anyways and we would have to follow the
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
federal regulation anyway but it it
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
would just
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
draw that attention to it's not a blank
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
check yeah
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
so so i would be happy that way too if
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
if the language of this section uh
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
stated what the what the what the guard
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
rails were
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
for um spinning a little tighter
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay i will work with kevin to reward
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
that'd be great okay great and i would
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
just say we are in support of
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
okay so um so we're gonna
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
what what are we gonna uh we'll call
 
02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
that the uh the
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%

don't please don't call it babysitting
 
02:06:55.679 --> 02:06:56.950 align:start position:0%

02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have to call it scholarship
 
02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:08.069 align:start position:0%
you don't have to call it scholarship
right

02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:08.079 align:start position:0%

maybe ms rounds you could you could take
 
02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
the first shot at writing something so
 
02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:24.790 align:start position:0%
the first shot at writing something so
it

02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
comports to federal regulations
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
i i don't i think just adding um as
 
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
allowed by federal regulation is fine i
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:44.550 --> 02:07:44.560 align:start position:0%

that was nine minutes oh no that was 14
 
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
minutes so that was a good time estimate
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
