ways in which we can improve our

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
the areas we can agree on
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%

care to open the discussion with what's
 
00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:12.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
oh yeah before before I begin before I
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
begin I would just uh I'm going to
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
schedule two more meetings today
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
one for two weeks from today
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
and another for two weeks after that
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that one of those
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
meetings will
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
include a representative from the
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to talk to us
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
about enforcement of campaign Finance
 
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.330 align:start position:0%
about enforcement of campaign Finance
law

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh hope maybe the next meeting but one
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
if you need that Jerry sir which which
 
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.049 align:start position:0%
if you need that Jerry sir which which
oh

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:46.669 align:start position:0%
oh
yeah

00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:48.539 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh and I think on the uh the second of
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
those two meetings uh whichever one is
 
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.250 align:start position:0%
those two meetings uh whichever one is
open

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.390 align:start position:0%
open
it

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be a good time to start
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
discussing uh you know see what the
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
areas of agreement are among us
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
and maybe start outlining what a report
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
would look like I'm not look looking to
 
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
truncate this process prematurely but
 
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
we've had several meetings now and I
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
think it's probably time to start
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
thinking about the end product that
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
sounded oh that sound good to you guys
 
00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
two more meetings scheduled
 
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
two weeks from today another two weeks
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
after that that would be the
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
13th and the 27th thank you
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
representative Ward
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
and one of those meetings hopefully
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
we'll hear from the Attorney General's
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
office and the other will start planning
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
what our end product will look like
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative that sounds like a
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
good a good plan and I really could we
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
send something official and maybe urgent
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
to the AG's office because if they came
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
on the 13th that would set us up
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
to kind of Define our tasks with more
 
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.409 align:start position:0%

precision

00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
precision
 
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:03.539 align:start position:0%
and be more productive on our second
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.100 align:start position:0%
that would address most or all of the
 
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
problems identified in the Secretary of
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
State's memo and I sort of just listed
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
those in a very mechanical fashion in
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
that handout that I just passed around
 
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:52.909 align:start position:0%
that handout that I just passed around
um

00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
but uh there's kind of a very I think
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
very it's persuasive that the the things
 
00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
identified as problems really are
 
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
problems that don't involve
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
um political the kind of political
 
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
judgment the Democrats and Republicans
 
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.330 align:start position:0%
judgment the Democrats and Republicans
often

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
that generate disagreement
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
um that that are more administrative
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
problems that that you know good clear
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
legislation could solve I think that's
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
what the Secretary of State's memo
 
00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
really that was a great service to us
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
and so I think yeah well you know we we
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
should set as our task solving most of
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
those problems
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
right what one example I don't know if
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's in your list I haven't had a chance
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
to read it yet but the the use of
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
Fiscal Agent Financial agent Treasurer
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
with regard to candidates and candidate
 
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.070 align:start position:0%
with regard to candidates and candidate
committees

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh I can't see a reason why we can't
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
settle on a single term there
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
single a single phrase to use right so
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
yes there's another there's another just
 
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:55.940 align:start position:0%
uh maybe process or anything
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
did you pass around your definitions to
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
everybody so maybe the next meeting if
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
people have
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
um this this is just represent I'm
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
speaking for you representative Lane
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is her you know not her best and
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
final effort it was just kind of an
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
initial effort to create uh to solve
 
00:22:15.649 --> 00:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
some of the problems that are current
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
definitions create by by writing new and
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
better ones but maybe everybody could
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
take a look at those between now and the
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
next meeting and
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
um and come back with suggestions
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
um so that we can make a little we we
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
can lay down that Foundation the
 
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:33.299 align:start position:0%
foundation of good definitions sooner
 
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
rather than later
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
I can I can send them out electronically
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
to the folks if that helps
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah that would definitely help
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
all right to get an electronic copy and
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative mirrorhead would you
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
send one of your list also
 
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I've uh
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
I started a similar list I don't
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
consider it ready but I was I was a
 
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299 align:start position:0%
little hesitant but yeah
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
but by our next meeting I'll have
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
I figured this way everybody can look at
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
them and say no that doesn't make sense
 
00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:30.299 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to do it this way then
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't do it you know because the
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
hardest thing I'm having trouble with is
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
candidate and candidate committee and is
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
a can't do we do we require the
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
candidate to have a candidate committee
 
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
and if we don't
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
um then how to how do we work that
 
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
filing or just do we just have a
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
separate we have a political committee
 
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
and a candidate committee and a
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
candidate and those are the only three
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
things we have I I don't know I'm trying
 
00:23:59.159 --> 00:24:00.409 align:start position:0%
things we have I I don't know I'm trying
to

00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
figure that approach out well I've been
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about that also and
 
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
I do think
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
enabling uh particularly a state
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
representative candidate to run as a
 
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
candidate without having to form a
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
committee reduces the the burdensiveness
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
of the process because for State Rep
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
not as expensive or complicated uh
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
with regards to the campaigning and if
 
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
we make it too burdensome for what's
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
typically a small effort compared to you
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
know the higher offices then it
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
increases the barrier to entry which we
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to do
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
we want to keep the barrier to entry for
 
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.930 align:start position:0%
we want to keep the barrier to entry for
candidates

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
at some level so we don't exclude people
 
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
is what I think
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
and as far as candidates and candidate
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
committees in that state rep context
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking about this as well I
 
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
don't know why we couldn't just have the
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
same set of requirements for both in
 
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
terms of deadlines for reporting
 
00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:09.299 align:start position:0%
and for that matter for contribution
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
limits or
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
one of the areas that this right you
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
think in the same way
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
we'll have to look at it and look for
 
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539 align:start position:0%
pitfalls in that but
 
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
so far I'm not seeing any
 
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.930 align:start position:0%
so far I'm not seeing any
uh

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
one area that's different between the
 
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.690 align:start position:0%
one area that's different between the
two

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.110 align:start position:0%
two
were

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
I remember right limits on how much a
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
candidate contributes to somebody else
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
another effort versus how much
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing why those should be
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
different at this point
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
that's just an example of something we
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
could bring into
 
00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
are we fairly decided that we want to
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
put all of them no longer have
 
00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.250 align:start position:0%
put all of them no longer have
exploratory

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
exploratory
 
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.930 align:start position:0%
exploratory
campaign

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
and either transition or whatever they
 
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
were just going to have one kind of
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
cycle and the limits are going to be on
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
that cycle
 
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
yeah that was one of the items on my
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
list which okay I need to refine a
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
little bit okay but
 
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.950 align:start position:0%
little bit okay but
uh

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
yeah basically
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking I'm thinking we should
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
Define what we mean by election cycle
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
and we've discussed this in previous
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
meetings I'm thinking it the election
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
cycle as defined should start the day
 
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
after the general election
 
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
and go through the day of the general
 
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:55.970 align:start position:0%
and go through the day of the general
election

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
again have the conversation because I
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't think representative Barry was
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
here last week last time we met
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Barry wasn't here so I
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
wanted him to see yeah he'll be here in
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes by the way okay but
 
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.529 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes by the way okay but
uh

00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
another item on my on my list Common
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
Center reporting deadlines for
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
candidates and candidate committees
 
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh that the list of Secretary of State's
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
office Mr Fish gave us
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
or the table showing
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
the different reporting deadlines
 
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:35.630 align:start position:0%
the different reporting deadlines
uh

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that I had about that
 
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
is that some of these particularly the
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
super Pacs
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
they start spending like right before
 
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
the sometimes right before the election
 
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:48.539 align:start position:0%
or get really intense so some of those
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
reporting dates may not capture those
 
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
before the election so so I can't
 
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
remember if we have we have
 
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
a reporting date not long before the
 
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
election and then again right after
 
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.870 align:start position:0%
election and then again right after
so

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
just as a way of discussing it for the
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
packs that don't really start spending
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
money until say a month or 45 days
 
00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:16.490 align:start position:0%
money until say a month or 45 days
before

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
if we have them on a regular cycle
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
do we put it close enough or some places
 
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
tie it to when they make the expense I
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
think even now our own one says
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
expenditures over a certain amount you
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
have to immediately report them or
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
within three days or something
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
so but then we start differentiating and
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
again it makes it more complicated but
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm just throwing it out there no I
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
understand I I was actually thinking
 
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:46.940 align:start position:0%
specifically of the distinction between
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
a candidate running as a candidate
 
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:54.059 align:start position:0%
and as his or her own Fiscal Agent for
 
00:28:54.059 --> 00:28:55.070 align:start position:0%
and as his or her own Fiscal Agent for
example

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
and a candidate committee
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I think a candidate committee has
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
already has already defined differently
 
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
and I think we've discussed this also I
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
was also thinking right right now we
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
have an election cycle
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
I think it I'm not did we find a
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
definition of that term in the statutes
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
does it exist
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
no it's kind of I think it's
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
most people assume it's what we were
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
just talking about which is the day
 
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
after the general election until the
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
through the day of the next general
 
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.750 align:start position:0%
through the day of the next general
election

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
but the election cycle has I think three
 
00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
phases right there's free filing there's
 
00:30:00.169 --> 00:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
the primary
 
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh period and then there's the general
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
when the secretary of state was here
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
with Mr Fitch I think
 
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
he was floating the idea of having you
 
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
know the the date that a candidate files
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
his candidates his or her candidacy
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
would be the date on which they
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
officially become a candidate
 
00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
and I was thinking that made some good
 
00:30:39.899 --> 00:30:43.549 align:start position:0%
and I was thinking that made some good
sense

00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
I don't like it because oh there's a lot
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
of campaign campaign Finance going on
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
before you announce I mean
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
and so you would lose all of that you
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
would lose all of that transparency
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
so somebody's really smart you can you
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
donate you get all your donations and
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
spend as much as you want before which
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
you can do and and then but you don't
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
have to declare it
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
and you're not really a candidate so
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
what so when I I floated a balloon and
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
what I drafted that it's like when you
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
start acting like a candidate and when
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
you make get contributions and you get
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
dispersed and you start making
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
disbursements that's when you're a
 
00:31:27.659 --> 00:31:28.669 align:start position:0%
disbursements that's when you're a
candidate

00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
and then you have and I guess then you
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
I haven't completely thought that
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
through yet what my thinking was more
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
along the lines we do have
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
in the statutes that when you
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
put out advertising
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
in intended to
 
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:54.299 align:start position:0%
promote or elect someone as a candidate
 
00:31:54.299 --> 00:31:56.990 align:start position:0%
promote or elect someone as a candidate
and

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
maybe we can work it around that I don't
 
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
it does offer a broader definition
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
candidate than just when you announce
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
because you know even in my small
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
on an unopposed one I was running well
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
before I filed well and with a two-year
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
term for any office you're really always
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
running campaign is never over right
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
right really if you're intending to run
 
00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:30.889 align:start position:0%
right really if you're intending to run
again

00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh you did say something a bit ago about
 
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.549 align:start position:0%
uh you did say something a bit ago about
uh

00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
removing some committee types and one of
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
the ones you mentioned was the
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
dude I remember that did I hear that
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
right we talked about
 
00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:46.010 align:start position:0%
right we talked about
um

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.529 align:start position:0%
um
expiratory

00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
expiratory
 
00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:51.419 align:start position:0%
um then the campaign and then is there
 
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
there's three different kinds I think
 
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
right now in the three three of them is
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
it transition or inauguration oh that's
 
00:33:00.899 --> 00:33:01.669 align:start position:0%
it transition or inauguration oh that's
the

00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
it's the one in the
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
so when we were talking before we were
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
saying let's just say for instance I
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
think one of the it's 5 000 for each
 
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
category so in other words just make it
 
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand for the whole shebang
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
so you can give 15 000 from the time
 
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
you know that candidate is a candidate
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
and if you want to do it early grade if
 
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
you don't you can wait but I think
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
rather than have all these you know
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
it's not a lot I don't know how many
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find it in the statute
 
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:51.590 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find it in the statute
yeah

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
that's going to take some more thought
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
on my part yeah it's primary yeah it's
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
in 6644.
 
00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.230 align:start position:0%
in 6644.
so

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.970 align:start position:0%
so
it's

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:03.980 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount contributed during
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
exploratory than during the primary and
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
then during the election
 
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is that you can
 
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and I think this was representative
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
Barry's suggestion is that then the
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
whole the total then for a candidate
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
um and for a non-candidate so and then
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
they divide it up by different political
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
committees which we can do or cannot do
 
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
I mean we can decide
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
I think for the ones that are quote
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
super Pacs we can't limit their
 
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.710 align:start position:0%
super Pacs we can't limit their
expenditures

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.970 align:start position:0%
expenditures
under

00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.629 align:start position:0%
under
um

00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
federal law we can't limit those
 
00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:48.349 align:start position:0%
federal law we can't limit those
expenditures

00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:34:48.359 --> 00:34:49.730 align:start position:0%
expenditures
so

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
um but you can limit the the campaign
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
but the concern I always have
 
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.630 align:start position:0%
but the concern I always have
is

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.910 align:start position:0%
is
balancing

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
balancing
 
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.730 align:start position:0%
balancing
uh

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:18.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
the usefulness of transparency and
 
00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:22.849 align:start position:0%
the usefulness of transparency and
campaign

00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
Finance for the public the voters
 
00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:29.780 align:start position:0%
uh balance that against
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
the absolute respect I think we need to
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
have first the rights guaranteed by the
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
First Amendment right
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
and to me an exploratory committee
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
so-called I mean what
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
was to stop someone from collecting
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
money from people who like them to put
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
ads saying he's a terrific fella or a
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful woman or
 
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
an excellent individual
 
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
the person has a right to do that right
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's where
 
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
but that's why I can that's where I
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
could agree with the exploratory
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
committee designation just going away I
 
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.930 align:start position:0%
committee designation just going away I
mean

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
someone could be exploring how much
 
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
support they might get they could
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
they could sponsor it people could
 
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
sponsor ads saying how wonderful they
 
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
are and then do polling there's nothing
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
to prevent that it shouldn't be anything
 
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
to prevent that all on their own
 
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.370 align:start position:0%
to prevent that all on their own
privately

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
privately
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
that's an exploration
 
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
that's an exploration
right

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
in a sense yep
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I know I'm jumping in and out
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
of Representative there is fine
 
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.849 align:start position:0%
of Representative there is fine
um

00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
yes I know that's why so I'm that's why
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to opine on it we welcome
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
whatever little bit of your time you can
 
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
spare us it seems to be it seems to be
 
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.730 align:start position:0%
spare us it seems to be it seems to be
fleeting

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
fleeting
 
00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.690 align:start position:0%
fleeting
um

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know if we can't get rid of
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
exploratory altogether a easy compromise
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
would be to cap how much it can take in
 
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.550 align:start position:0%
would be to cap how much it can take in
entirely

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
say if you're going to form an
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
exploratory committee you may take in no
 
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
more than fifteen thousand dollars
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
period or something like that that's a
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
compromise if you didn't if I mean if we
 
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
all just want to get rid of it I I'm
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
fine with that it's I think it's just a
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
loop I don't say a loophole but I just
 
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
find the notion that you can raise
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
a bajillion dollars as an exploratory
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee it's like you're not exp if
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
you're if I raise a million dollars
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
around for state representative am I
 
00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:14.579 align:start position:0%
exploring state representative
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
I think I I think I figured it out
 
00:37:18.839 --> 00:37:20.870 align:start position:0%
I think I I think I figured it out
representative

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
I mean the just the sort of mechanical
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
facts are that the cycle is you've
 
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
defined it accurately runs from the day
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
after an election a general election to
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
the day of the next general election so
 
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's the period of time in which
 
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
somebody might you know campaign more or
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
less officially and the only moment at
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
which we formally know somebody's a
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
candidate is the moment which they file
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
right and so that would just be roughly
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
the last six months of that 24-month
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
period which leaves open an 18-month
 
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
period in which they might raise and
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
spend money right but of course there's
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
no way to know they're a candidate
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
because they don't have to file until
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
June or whatever once they officially
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
file there are these two you know chunks
 
00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:05.579 align:start position:0%
of the campaign the primary campaign and
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
then the general election campaign and
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
and so that's what creates this three
 
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
category categories but I think the
 
00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:14.579 align:start position:0%
and and of course as you say there's
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
there's on one hand a kind of Freedom
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
value that says anybody should be able
 
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.550 align:start position:0%
value that says anybody should be able
to

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
you know raise and spend money to do
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
whatever is legal
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
um including Advanced their reputation
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
if that's the way that's a good way to
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
put it right that's what I had in mind
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
and there's also a
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you know kind of a corruption
 
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.890 align:start position:0%
um you know kind of a corruption
anti-corruption

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
anti-corruption
 
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
um that would normally be dispositive
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
and it would rule out any regulations on
 
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
what people can raise and spend at any
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
point in a campaign except that
 
00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
you know citizens representatives and
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
courts have said that the public hasn't
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
you know an interest in
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
um monitoring what people raise and
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
spend and advancing themselves for
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
public office in an effort to combat
 
00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
corruption and and so that is what
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
allows us to regulate what people raise
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
and spend but it's just that the
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
formalities of things allow us to do it
 
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
more effectively after they file and
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
less effectively in that window of time
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
before they file
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
and and so I see that you know the very
 
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.030 align:start position:0%
kind of
um

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
Instinct here is to is to treat this
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
whole window of time
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
um the same way and and say in that
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
whole window of time people should be
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
able to raise X
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
for advancing themselves and they have
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
to mean they have to let you know once
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
they hit a threshold let the voters know
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
who they're raising money from and what
 
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
they're spending money on
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
um yeah and we're not saying they can't
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
raise the money it's just basically you
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
just have to tell people how you're
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
spending the money who you're raising it
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
from and how you're spending it
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
so and and these are usually going to be
 
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
for the bigger races
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
so governor
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
executive Council and state senate
 
00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:59.990 align:start position:0%
executive Council and state senate
so

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
they would probably have staff doing
 
00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:05.990 align:start position:0%
they would probably have staff doing
that

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
I like the phrase representative
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
Muirhead though about people raising
 
00:40:13.089 --> 00:40:13.099 align:start position:0%
money and spending it to enhance their
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
reputation or or for that matter
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
publicize their views on various issues
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
because it does the uh our election
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
system have a legitimate interest you
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
know a compelling interest in regulating
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
that because people are free
 
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
to express their views on public on any
 
00:40:34.859 --> 00:40:37.069 align:start position:0%
to express their views on public on any
issue

00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:39.470 align:start position:0%
issue
and

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
so we have a con
 
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
telling transparency interest to
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
regulate or monitor that I'm not
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
convinced of that
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
in fact I'm I'm
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
from our past discussion should probably
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
understand already I'm biased against
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
regulation of free speech to begin with
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
and I really need a really good reason
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
to infringe on it
 
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
in my in my view so how do you separate
 
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:07.849 align:start position:0%
in my in my view so how do you separate
them

00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:41:07.859 --> 00:41:09.490 align:start position:0%
them
someone

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:09.500 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
just rephrase the question a little bit
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
if someone spends a year
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh publicizing their views on important
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
and sometimes controversial issues
 
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:23.579 align:start position:0%
and saying what how wonderful they'll be
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
for dealing with it but never ever
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
if we're going to put this in statute it
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
has to be defined so it's you know some
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
unambiguous set of criteria if we can do
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
that I mean
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
and and so also the people won't
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
be using the term loophole personally
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm actually kind of
 
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
fatigued with the word loophole because
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
to me if you're within the law are you
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
within the law as far as
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
the law is concerned
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
but anyway so there's my question
 
00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
I think to that end you know my issue
 
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
with the quote exploratory phase is we
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
they start candidates start getting into
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
the level of ridiculousness of
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
if I were to run for governor or you
 
00:42:12.839 --> 00:42:13.730 align:start position:0%
if I were to run for governor or you
know

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
um and I think
 
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
maybe a summation we can all agree with
 
00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.230 align:start position:0%
maybe a summation we can all agree with
is

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
when is exploring no longer exploring
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
right and federally it's defined as when
 
00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
they say I'm running for X right and
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide state in the state we say it's
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
when you file in June
 
00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:31.730 align:start position:0%
when you file in June
um

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
so I think that's kind of
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
I guess that's something that I'm trying
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
to avoid in this is the Ridiculousness
 
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.829 align:start position:0%
to avoid in this is the Ridiculousness
of

00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
if I was to run for a governor you know
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
um when they're not actually exploring a
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
race they're fully invested they have
 
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
staff right
 
00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:50.810 align:start position:0%
staff right
um

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
you know and so I I get that I mean you
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
know an easy solution is to eliminate
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
the exploratory phase and just take the
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
15 grand and divide it up 75 and 75
 
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
um and call it a day
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I I think the filing period I know
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
that we taught that we tie the filing
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
period to campaign Finance laws
 
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.089 align:start position:0%
period to campaign Finance laws
um

00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have to do that the feds don't
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
do that they don't they don't tie filing
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
to that they do some on reporting they
 
00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:20.579 align:start position:0%
they'll tie to report on reporting but
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
the feds you're a declared candidate
 
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
when you're declared when you declare
 
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
that you're a candidate doesn't mean we
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
have to do it that way I certainly have
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
my issue with how the feds handle things
 
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:29.990 align:start position:0%
my issue with how the feds handle things
um

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
but I I guess like that's kind of like
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
my sentiment is
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
I I just don't want candidates running
 
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
around being ridiculous saying you know
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
if I were if I were to run for governor
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
like nah bro you're you've raised two
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars you're running for
 
00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.530 align:start position:0%
million dollars you're running for
governor

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
um you know so I guess that that's kind
 
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
of my my sentiment on it is it the worst
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
of all evils no
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
um if we can clean it up get rid of it
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
um if your issue is the limiting of the
 
00:43:57.599 --> 00:43:59.390 align:start position:0%
um if your issue is the limiting of the
speech

00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
speech
 
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.130 align:start position:0%
speech
um

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
you know then you just they just
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate the period and break up the
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
15K over the two periods and
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
you effectively have the same
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
the same outcome without having the
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
Ridiculousness of if I were to run for
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
governor but one of my concerns also oh
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
sorry one of my concerns also was that
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
whatever we come up with we try to come
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
up with some
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
unambiguous Criterion
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
who's a candidate
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
with the hope that that will reduce the
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
amount of argument that has to take
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
place in the courts
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
now that's that's an idealistic notion
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
but because people are really you know
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
people are really clever
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
and people as a class are very good at
 
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
communicating in a way that you can't
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
that we can't really control nor should
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
we go ahead I'm sorry representative
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
you know I'll lay around all of the
 
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
exploratory activity Counterpoint as we
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
eliminate exploratory
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
away around it is they just form a pack
 
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
and they operate out of the pack until
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
they file
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and you see you see that happen all
 
00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:08.540 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
you know so it's like there's no perfect
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
outcome I just
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
I want to eliminate the Ridiculousness
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
you know perfect Perfection is not only
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
unobtainable it's really we really don't
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
even know what it would mean so
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think we can respect the
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
quality principle that
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
um that that aiming for Perfection you
 
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
know is a Fool's errand without at the
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
same time aim for some improvement over
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
the laws that are already on the books
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to the study right the
 
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
second thing we want to respect is your
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
you know what you're voicing the freedom
 
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.589 align:start position:0%
you know what you're voicing the freedom
interest

00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
in speech in general and in various
 
00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
types of political speech and so the
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
only speech that we are addressing and
 
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
that our law is already address is
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
speech that aims to influence an
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
election right by promoting opposing
 
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.309 align:start position:0%
election right by promoting opposing
attacking

00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
attacking
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
or supporting
 
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
um a measure or a candidate and and so
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's various political speech that
 
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
this doesn't include such as say if you
 
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
want to create a documentary in global
 
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
warming like Al Gore did and spent
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars making
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
it that's not regulated by this if you
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
want to say you know if you have an
 
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
insurance company and you're going to
 
00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.010 align:start position:0%
insurance company and you're going to
say

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
um you know Betsy Smith's uh jolly good
 
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
person and you should buy insurance from
 
00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.870 align:start position:0%
person and you should buy insurance from
her

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
um or a car dealership or whatever you
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
can promote your reputation with
 
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
Billboards and ads and radio spots also
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
with wouldn't be regulated by this code
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
um that kind of commercial speech so
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
this is only about influencing money
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
spent to influence an election
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
by supporting or opposing roughly
 
00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099 align:start position:0%
speaking measures or persons and
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
um and the question you know what you
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
want to do Ross as I understand it is
 
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.150 align:start position:0%
want to do Ross as I understand it is
um

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.410 align:start position:0%
um
is

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
address in a in a consistent way this
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
period of time between the day after a
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
general election and the and when a
 
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
candidate files and and maybe you know
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
it'll turn out that the quality
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
principle of pursuing Perfection means
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
anything we try here just won't work and
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
we'll have to give it up but we should
 
00:47:22.329 --> 00:47:22.339 align:start position:0%
at least see what we can do before
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
assuming we can't get any Improvement in
 
00:47:24.599 --> 00:47:26.150 align:start position:0%
assuming we can't get any Improvement in
that

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sure having uh
 
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
look through the the election law our
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
election system laws the campaign
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
Finance laws and having looked at the
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's Memo from Mr Fitch
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'm convinced I think we're all
 
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
convinced we can find areas of agreement
 
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
where things can be improved
 
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
even if just to remove contradictions
 
00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.470 align:start position:0%
even if just to remove contradictions
and

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
sources of confusion
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
I did have a thought about
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
you know sources of confusion about when
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
does this end right when we talked about
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
that with the loans two uh three weeks
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
ago yeah I did have some expounding
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
um which is we could set the end of the
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
period as the certification of the
 
00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.349 align:start position:0%
period as the certification of the
election

00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
um because that is in fact the end when
 
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
the election is certified and all the
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
legal contests are over it's over at
 
00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:17.579 align:start position:0%
that point it is done
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's a I just want to toss that
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
out there because I did have that
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
thought that may be a um
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
a happy middle ground for me wanting to
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
end it the day after the election and
 
00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
other people wanted to go on for six
 
00:48:29.819 --> 00:48:30.829 align:start position:0%
other people wanted to go on for six
months

00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
maybe the certification
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
um and see session secession
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me when it stops secession when
 
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
it stops no when all legal contests have
 
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
no and it sometimes that could be a
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
really long time though I mean as we've
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
if somebody really wants because there
 
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
was one that was being contested
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
to the ballot law commission quite a
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
which one
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
I can't remember it was was it a senate
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
it was a senate maybe he wasn't
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
contesting it he wasn't contesting it I
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know oh I think I know what
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
you're talking about it was a senate it
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
was absentee Outlets
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
yes yes yeah I mean that the election
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
was certified it was over a member was
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
sat I mean it was done it was it like
 
00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:20.099 align:start position:0%
what was
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah what was to be gained right and we
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
did talk about the loan piece too as
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
well because you had mentioned if you
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
make a loan and you want to pay it back
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
um that would be you could you could
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
raise money to do that as long as you're
 
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
paying things off from your prior that
 
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
were occurred during your election if
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
you're raising new money to pay off
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
dance in other words there are no loans
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
that's going to be in the next election
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
cycle yes that we just figured we needed
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
a bright line so whether it's the date
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
of certification or whether it's the
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
date after I think it was just trying to
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
find a bright line
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
as to when those would be because you
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
know a lot of people do homes even you
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
know bank loans or whatever as long as
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
you're paying them off oh man let's take
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
a bank one run a campaign
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so you deserve to serve all the
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
well that's tied to my thought that we
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
should Define an election an election
 
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.650 align:start position:0%
should Define an election an election
cycle

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
by certain dates that everybody will
 
00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:27.650 align:start position:0%
by certain dates that everybody will
know

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
and you brought up the thought about uh
 
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
so that then we can define a previous
 
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
election cycle and a current election
 
00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.950 align:start position:0%
election cycle and a current election
cycle

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to make sure that
 
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
candidates still have the opportunity to
 
00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.339 align:start position:0%
raise funds if people will contribute to
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
pay off loans they they took for the
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
previous election cycle
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
currently you can retain those funds you
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
can only spend them for
 
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.290 align:start position:0%
can only spend them for
uh

00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
if you run in one the preview if you ran
 
00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
in the previous election cycle you can
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
retain those funds under your control
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
but they can only be used
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
for certain specific politically related
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
purposes or uh to be donated to an
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
approved charity am I getting that right
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
and you can roll them over to the next
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
Camp the the current
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
election cycle do they leave anything
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
out there Ross no I mean it's I I that's
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
the basics I've said before I have I
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
have issues with that because that's not
 
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
how the money is going to work but what
 
00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
would happen is they would if I took out
 
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
a twenty thousand dollar loan and my
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
election ended and I won
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
and I had twenty thousand dollars
 
00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
sitting on the book and then Russ wanted
 
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
to give me 20 grand to help me pay off
 
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
my loans I would then on paper pay off
 
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:44.579 align:start position:0%
my loans and then give myself another
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollar loan on the other
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
side because the money has already been
 
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.230 align:start position:0%
side because the money has already been
spent

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
um and that that's my problem is it's
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
that that rolling of the loan is is
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen is they're just
 
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
gonna it's it's a way for Russ to give
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
me forty thousand dollars
 
00:51:57.599 --> 00:51:58.250 align:start position:0%
me forty thousand dollars
um

00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
which I look forward to that check
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I thought I already gave you that oh
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
well it didn't clear so you should have
 
00:52:08.089 --> 00:52:08.099 align:start position:0%
got a note well if if the loan appear
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
like I guess it
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
so is he going to be able to give then
 
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
over the campaign contribution amount
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
right is that what you're saying that's
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
my concern yes if they'll be able to
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
to the extent that campaign Finance laws
 
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
should exist within the confines of the
 
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
First Amendment they should be
 
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
equally applied rigid and right not once
 
00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:32.630 align:start position:0%
equally applied rigid and right not once
again

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
not easily circumventable that doesn't
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
mean that we will be able to prevent
 
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
everything I'm not I thought we're not
 
00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
going to get Perfection yeah I'm not so
 
00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.089 align:start position:0%
going to get Perfection yeah I'm not so
um

00:52:41.089 --> 00:52:41.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not so naive to believe that we
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
could do that but I do believe that you
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
can knock out the main easy ways that
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
are that are done to right
 
00:52:52.849 --> 00:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to use the term loophole
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
because that's not appropriate but to
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
so what the the scenario as I understand
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
it that you're suggesting is something
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
where I have
 
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.790 align:start position:0%
where I have
a

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
um you know campaign of your head in
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
2014 year in 2016 year in 2018 2020 2022
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
they they all are in debt because of the
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
money I spent I essentially loaned the
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
campaigns and I can raise money to to
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
pay off those debt to myself
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
um simultaneously for all those
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
campaigns and each campaign has its own
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
limit then I could raise a lot of money
 
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean you could do something as as
 
00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
create you know you pay off twenty
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and then remember
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to give to your campaign
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
an unlimited amount of money it's your
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
campaign so then you paid off twenty
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in debt from 2020 and
 
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
now you've made a twenty thousand dollar
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
contribution from yourself into 2022
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
you know once again
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
um circumventing the intention of the
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
election Finance contribution loss
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's my issues with I I have I
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
have huge issues with loans just because
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
of how
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
it's an accounting trick to move money
 
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
around that that's what it is what's the
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
reality is is the people who loan money
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
into campaigns the reality is people who
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
loan money into campaigns know they're
 
00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
not getting it back
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's the reality you can make the
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
statement if it's a loan they expect to
 
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
get it back the reality is they know
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
they're not getting it back
 
00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:18.790 align:start position:0%
they're not getting it back
um

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
now he tells us so so what happens then
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah don't you wish you'd known that
 
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh if you don't give it back then you
 
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
just have it you maintain it on your
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
books and you carry a deficit for that
 
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
election you have to keep filing a
 
00:54:41.089 --> 00:54:41.099 align:start position:0%
report forever I mean every six months
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
right I I would make you could the way
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
you close it up is you'd say if you
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
insert date that we could quibble over
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
um you're eating you know the loan the
 
00:54:56.809 --> 00:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
loan shall not be paid back and you're
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know the the candidates eating that
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
it's close it's done okay
 
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
you've you have you have you know if
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
you've won your election you have six
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
months or however long it is right now
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
it's six months to go and backfill that
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
like give it six months to backfill that
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
so the loan then if it's a self-made
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
loan so if it's a loan from the
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
candidate oh yeah I've never seen a loan
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
that wasn't from the candidate okay I
 
00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
just checking okay so you have to be
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
from the candidate because if it's from
 
00:55:26.809 --> 00:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
another entity that entity is now making
 
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
a campaign Finance violation exactly so
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
I guess you could have I guess that's
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
where I was headed yeah yeah I I guess
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
in theory you could I guess in theory
 
00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
anyone could loan a campaign up to the
 
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.910 align:start position:0%
anyone could loan a campaign up to the
Limit

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
Limit
 
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.510 align:start position:0%
Limit
um

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
in theory
 
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
so you're talking specifically loans
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
made by a candidate to his or her own
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
campaign once virtually all campaign
 
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
finances I understand you're saying
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's virtually all but you are taught
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
you are talking specifically about loans
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
a candidate makes
 
00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
to that candidate's own campaign right I
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
have never seen a loan in campaign
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
Finance from anyone other than right but
 
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
you're not answering my question I'm not
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not trying to dodge it what is
 
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
the question specifically but I
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
understand that you're saying it's a
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
practical I'm sorry I didn't mean to
 
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
sound that way no it's okay but you're
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
saying as a practical matter you've
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
never seen a case of a loan to a
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
campaign except from the candidate
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
correct the candidates themselves and I
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
would imagine that if another entity
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
made a loan
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
to a candidate it would have to be by
 
00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
definition a contribution right
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and at that point I would question if
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
it's a loan because if it's a
 
00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
contribution in and you pay it back well
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's just refunding a contribution
 
00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
so so I had one more thought so
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
again you're talking
 
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.430 align:start position:0%
again you're talking
simply

00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
specifically about loans that candidates
 
00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
make to their own campaigns yes and what
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
I'm getting what I'm getting from your
 
00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
comments is that that would be it would
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
be adequate
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
to Define it that way in a statute
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
because you've never as a practical
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
matter you've never seen another any
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
other kind of loan yes I I yes that is
 
00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
correct I I would love to find the bank
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
that would loan me a million dollars and
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
run for governor
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
and then you'd move to the Caribbean or
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
no I would just close up the committee
 
00:57:21.849 --> 00:57:21.859 align:start position:0%
and they'd go after the dead entity
 
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:24.980 align:start position:0%
that's why they would never do it anyway
 
00:57:28.329 --> 00:57:28.339 align:start position:0%
like loaning money to an LLC
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
you don't have any assets they're not
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
I don't see a problem on the face of it
 
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.109 align:start position:0%
I don't see a problem on the face of it
with

00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
putting a limit on how long a candidate
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
has to clear a loan that that candidate
 
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.530 align:start position:0%
has to clear a loan that that candidate
made

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
the candidates make for their own
 
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
you don't always understand everything
 
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
about an idea in the first few minutes
 
00:57:56.809 --> 00:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
right but on the face of it I don't see
 
00:57:56.819 --> 00:57:57.589 align:start position:0%
right but on the face of it I don't see
a

00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that don't react as that being an
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
issue that's my I don't want the loan
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
used as an accounting trick to
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
run around the the laws that we've spent
 
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
a long time we are spending a long time
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
to set that being said if a candidate
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
wants to loan their campaign a hundred
 
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:17.460 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that's their business
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
they have a right to put in as much as
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
they want
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
um and if donors want to give to them
 
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
awesomenesses that they could be
 
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
repaying back the loan from the
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
candidate that's fine I just have a
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
problem when that's being done six years
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
down the road right so what you're
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
saying is you're proposing there'd be a
 
00:58:34.609 --> 00:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
time limit
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
during which for that election cycle but
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
that loan from the candidate could be
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
paid back
 
00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:45.059 align:start position:0%
correct uh okay let's think about that
 
00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'm talking about
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
yeah representative mirrorhead you had a
 
00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:52.069 align:start position:0%
yeah representative mirrorhead you had a
comment

00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
so I think we should get the right
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
advice we need to deal with the loan
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
issue um plausible to me that various
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
entities might make effective loans to a
 
00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
campaign if I go and I buy a hundred
 
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
pizzas for your campaign
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
and I've already hit the contribution
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
limit then your campaign needs to refund
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
me for those hundred pizzas I've
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
effectively made a loan of the value of
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
those pizzas or if you rent a fleet of
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
Vans for get out of the boat no you've
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
made it if you go and buy 100 pizzas
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
you've made an in-kind contribution you
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
have bought an item you have you have
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
bought an item and then immediately made
 
00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
an expenditure with it
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
um so you're on both sides of electric
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
so if you bought 100 pizzas a thousand
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
bucks you know you you would have an
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
in-kind contribution rust from your head
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars on the uh receipt
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
Into The Ledger and you'd have a
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh income contribution
 
00:59:43.609 --> 00:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
on the expenditure lips they're perhaps
 
00:59:45.049 --> 00:59:45.059 align:start position:0%
on the same day and that's current law
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
and it counts towards your threshold
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
what if I've already hit the threshold
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
and I buy some pizzas just to facilitate
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
the the event and I expect the campaign
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
to pay me back for those pizzas because
 
00:59:56.809 --> 00:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
I've already hit the limit then in
 
00:59:59.329 --> 00:59:59.339 align:start position:0%
theory you have made a um so if the
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
campaign pays you back that's not really
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
a loan you that's just them reimbursing
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
you for an expenditure there's a period
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
of time between the time I pay for those
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
pizzas and the time in which they pay me
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
back and during that time I've made them
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
alone I think it would be the
 
01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.049 align:start position:0%
alone I think it would be the
expectation

01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:12.059 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
right if I go and I buy pizzas for
 
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
volunteers at noon and I give it to them
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock and then at five o'clock
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
you've reimbursed me I mean because in
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
that sense any staffer who files an
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
expenditure report at the end of the
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
month has made an in-kind contribution
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
but there's no expect there's the
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
expectation that they'd be paid back
 
01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
immediately versus a candidate loan is
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
there's no expectation to be paid back
 
01:00:33.059 --> 01:00:34.549 align:start position:0%
there's no expectation to be paid back
immediately

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
or within 30 days or whatever you know I
 
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
I don't I I totally see where you're
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
saying it's actually kind of a brilliant
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
way to get there but um I don't think
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
that that would be
 
01:00:46.849 --> 01:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
I don't think that would qualify as a
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
loan that's
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
that's a you know it's almost like a
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
vendor yeah it's like yeah like a vendor
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
like if you know and there's yeah that's
 
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
a great way to put it like you know I
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't know which there are some vendors
 
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
that have terms
 
01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.930 align:start position:0%
that have terms
with

01:00:59.930 --> 01:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
um parties and candidates of you know
 
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
net 30 day and that sort of stuff that's
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
not an in-kind contribution or legal
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
fees right
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
um if if you you know you don't even
 
01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
know what the bill is you're incurring
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
the services but there's the expectation
 
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
that you'll be paid back
 
01:01:15.059 --> 01:01:15.890 align:start position:0%
that you'll be paid back
um

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
an in-kind contribution would be you buy
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
the pizzas with the expectation you
 
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
don't get paid back this is a good
 
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
example though what we all all
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
understand which I was saying earlier
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
people are very clever about finding
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
ways to do things so we we can't control
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
it all can we make some changes that
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
improve things and all this business
 
01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
with loans and repaying and all that the
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
candidate under the current system that
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
is still transparent people can find out
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's going on
 
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
yeah and when you see you know on
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursements to what representative
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
muirhead's trying to sit but saying is
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
they don't go in if you let's take the
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
the pizzas again right and you expect to
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed for the pizzas you're not
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
buying them for the campaign volunteers
 
01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
you are buying them with the expectation
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
of being reimbursed it wouldn't go in as
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollars of pizzas to
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead it would go in
 
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
as one thousand dollars of pizzas to pop
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
from Papa John uh two pot an expenditure
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
to Papa John's your name actually in
 
01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
theory should never appear on it because
 
01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
you didn't make the pizzas all you did
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
was buy them and transport them
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
um that's how that's how that's supposed
 
01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
to be done otherwise you can ossificate
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
literally anything
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
um in an exponential line by saying it's
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
a reimbursement clouded through a vendor
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative Riverhead you had a
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
comment and on the
 
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
just the earlier your earlier concern
 
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
Ross about the exploratory period
 
01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:40.849 align:start position:0%
Ross about the exploratory period
um

01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
you know one one
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
possible solution would be to have a law
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
that says something like right any
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
person or group that raises or spends X
 
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
dollars whatever the threshold is to
 
01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
peso a measure person
 
01:02:56.819 --> 01:02:58.490 align:start position:0%
peso a measure person
um

01:02:58.490 --> 01:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
during an election cycle must you know
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
register as a candidate or committee and
 
01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:06.059 align:start position:0%
must not raise more than why dollars
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
whatever the limit is from any person or
 
01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.230 align:start position:0%
whatever the limit is from any person or
group

01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
and and at that point we get away with
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
the distinction between exploratory
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
Primary in general
 
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.630 align:start position:0%
Primary in general
um

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and treat treat both you know
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
persons and groups the same is that is
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
that the kind of thing you're you want
 
01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
to work toward yes simplification less
 
01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
entity types streamline uniform
 
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
contribution limits
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
um I would love it if RSA 664 was like
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
four pages
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
not with loopholes or no I know it's not
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
the word use um not with um easy ways to
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
circumvent the intent of the legislator
 
01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily complex aspects of it and
 
01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
specifically with exploratory committees
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
what I've used the Ridiculousness of it
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
um there's a person running for governor
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
right now who is marching in parades
 
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
raising funds and says they are
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
exploring a race for governor they have
 
01:04:09.599 --> 01:04:10.490 align:start position:0%
exploring a race for governor they have
staff

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
they are running a campaign there is
 
01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
nothing exploring about that they are
 
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
doing that and not going to name names
 
01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
because it's not no point to it I'm just
 
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
saying it happens it happens every day I
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
wasn't doing that right uh there's one
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
um but I I am sure I am to your point
 
01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.299 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there will be more
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
um and it's not to say that that
 
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
candidate exploratory candidate is doing
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
anything wrong or nefarious it's just
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
ridiculous just declare what you're
 
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
running for
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
um because your exploratory phase ended
 
01:04:41.089 --> 01:04:41.099 align:start position:0%
when you raised a hundred thousand
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
dollars or whatever it was
 
01:04:45.049 --> 01:04:45.059 align:start position:0%
um you know you have the funds you need
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
to figure out if you want to run or not
 
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
because nothing stops you from stopping
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
and running at any point including if
 
01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
you file for a primary Nothing Stops you
 
01:04:53.569 --> 01:04:53.579 align:start position:0%
just your name just doesn't come off the
 
01:04:53.579 --> 01:04:56.809 align:start position:0%
just your name just doesn't come off the
ballot

01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
because I I've always viewed the filing
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
period as
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
these are the names that go on the
 
01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:01.990 align:start position:0%
these are the names that go on the
ballot

01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
and a little more than that because the
 
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
reality is is the primary
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
the primary not to get in the primary
 
01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
date discussions but the primary doesn't
 
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
begin the first week of June we all know
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
a joke like we all know that's that
 
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
that's not true the primary begins when
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
candidates start running for that office
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
the year before that a year before that
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
which by the way is totally their right
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
probably the smart thing to do
 
01:05:30.299 --> 01:05:31.549 align:start position:0%
probably the smart thing to do
politically

01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
politically
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
um but let's not act like it's anything
 
01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:35.579 align:start position:0%
my issue with exploratory candidacy is
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
it acts like it's something that it's
 
01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:38.329 align:start position:0%
it acts like it's something that it's
not

01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
and like let's just drop the pretense of
 
01:05:44.329 --> 01:05:44.339 align:start position:0%
what it is you know there's very little
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
in politics there's very little
 
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.510 align:start position:0%
in politics there's very little
legitimate

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
exploratory activity there is some
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
there is some I would never say that
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
there's none
 
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
but the reality is is once you start
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
getting to certain thresholds
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know if you raise a million dollars
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
in an exploratory campaign you're going
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
to tell me that that person's not
 
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.250 align:start position:0%
to tell me that that person's not
running

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:06.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
like come on now like a million dollars
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
to advance their name and their ideas
 
01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.609 align:start position:0%
to advance their name and their ideas
um

01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
you know and they don't even need by the
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
way they don't even need to declare an
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
office like you can form a candidate's
 
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
com or I know we don't call it anymore
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
but we can form a candidate a
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
candidate's committee or whatever the
 
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
term you want to use right
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
does the contribution limits are the
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
same across the board for State offices
 
01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't it doesn't matter you're a
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
candidate for office period it doesn't
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
matter the the limits the contribution
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
limit for State Rep are the same as the
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
contribution limits for governor council
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
state senate
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
um they're all exactly the same so it's
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's even if you changed your mind it
 
01:06:58.970 --> 01:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
so what exactly are you proposing we
 
01:07:01.799 --> 01:07:03.589 align:start position:0%
so what exactly are you proposing we
change

01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
what I would propose
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
um is eliminate the exploratory phase in
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
the interests of what I would believe
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
your concerns and also my concerns is
 
01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
that we don't artificially depress the
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
contribution limit so take the five five
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
and five and make it 75 and 75
 
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
call it a day I could personally
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
tolerate a world where it was five and
 
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
five but if we need a compromise to get
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
to the two phases that's fine and if you
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
want to leave exploratory phase in there
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
for legitimate exploratory phase
 
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
activity put in a low a total receipt
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
limit not individual donor receipt limit
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
total organizational receipt limit
 
01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:44.579 align:start position:0%
we can debate over that number what it
 
01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.990 align:start position:0%
may be
um

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
but that would be
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
um but that would be if I was making
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
let's call it the ideal system
 
01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
um representative Ward you know that
 
01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:00.299 align:start position:0%
that's what I would go because I you
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
know is it semi going to form an
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
exploratory committee for that's to go
 
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
to the chair you guys are subtle
 
01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:09.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
Persian class
 
01:08:12.059 --> 01:08:13.250 align:start position:0%
Persian class
um

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:15.059 align:start position:0%
you know is anybody here going to form
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
an exploratory committee to run for
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
state representative or are you just
 
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
so legitimate question like but for
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
governor by the way I think there is a
 
01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
legitimate phase of that um you gotta
 
01:08:28.249 --> 01:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
ask your spouse and if your spouse won't
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
support you
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
you've had it that's the explanation if
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
that was the case I wouldn't have won
 
01:08:32.759 --> 01:08:34.870 align:start position:0%
that was the case I wouldn't have won
twice

01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
twice
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
I believe my wife did tell me she voted
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
to get she told me she voted against me
 
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
the first time and voted for me the
 
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
second time you know she said I earned
 
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
that vote the second time
 
01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.329 align:start position:0%
that vote the second time
um

01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
it was because she liked how how much I
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
was out of the house she was like oh
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
I do too
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
I kind of like the idea of just having
 
01:09:01.199 --> 01:09:03.050 align:start position:0%
I kind of like the idea of just having
one

01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
this is the time
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
and to just blend them all together yeah
 
01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:12.179 align:start position:0%
in terms of contribution limits that's
 
01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
kind of what we're that's what we're
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
talking about here basically because do
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
we really need two phases even Primary
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
in general do we need those
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
again I'm not suggesting we change
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
anything about how these amounts are
 
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.769 align:start position:0%
anything about how these amounts are
reported

01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:09:29.809 --> 01:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
I mean I looked at that again last night
 
01:09:29.819 --> 01:09:31.370 align:start position:0%
I mean I looked at that again last night
and

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh you know the reporting element would
 
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
stay the same but do we need to have
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
separate limits for a primary and a
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
general election
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
individual you know those are individual
 
01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
con those are contributions from
 
01:09:45.289 --> 01:09:45.299 align:start position:0%
individuals basically
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean organization that's I mean
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
part of me is like no because I mean I
 
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
know that some people might want to wait
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
to see who wins the primary and then
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
give that money but they can still do
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
that in other words they give the person
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
save the total amount is 15 they give
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
them 10 and then if they win the primary
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
they give them another five there are
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
donors that do that
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
um right and they still could they still
 
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
could it doesn't change their behavior
 
01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:16.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering what is that
 
01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
division doing well I don't know so the
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
to answer the question what it does is
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
it prevents
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
what that does is it prevents the money
 
01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
from being spent in the primary so if
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
the contribution limits are five five
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
and five right now let's just say five
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
and five for keep it simple for right
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
now if if I go and I give you ten
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in theory you can only
 
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
spend five thousand of that dollars
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
and if you don't make it through the
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
primary you have to give me my money
 
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.510 align:start position:0%
primary you have to give me my money
back

01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.530 align:start position:0%
back
um

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
or you have to spend it I guess on your
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly how the state laws
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
are written but I think you'd have to
 
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
like you'd have you can't spend that
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
five Rand that second five grand until
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
you until after the primary phase is
 
01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.189 align:start position:0%
you until after the primary phase is
over

01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
um and there are like on the federal
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
side I know you cannot spend that money
 
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and that if you don't win your
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
primary you actually do have to give it
 
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.890 align:start position:0%
primary you actually do have to give it
back

01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we have that in state
 
01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you have to give it back
 
01:11:15.729 --> 01:11:15.739 align:start position:0%
in state um my my understanding is
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look it up to quote it
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
exactly I don't want to take the time
 
01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
right slow the conversation down but my
 
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
understanding from having read that
 
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:24.890 align:start position:0%
understanding from having read that
recently

01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
if you have money left over at the end
 
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
of a campaign
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
whether primary or general when the
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
campaign's over
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
you can use it for certain
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
politically related purposes you can
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
donate to another candidate I believe
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
you know in the next election cycle
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh you can roll it over and if you're
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to run again for some office you
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
can use it for that purpose or you can
 
01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:48.860 align:start position:0%
donate it to
 
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
a charitable
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh organization of some type and I think
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
that's you know specified some approved
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
charitable organization that's how I
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
understand you have to use the funds if
 
01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
you're not using them in another
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
campaign serps unless there's other
 
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
political purpose or charitable purpose
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
you can't the main point is you cannot
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
convert it to personal use
 
01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
which we all have to agree that that
 
01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense to me okay
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
someone wants to look it up no I'm
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
looking here at a surplus campaign
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
contributions Surplus campaign
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
contributions may be used after a
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
general or special election for
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
fundraising activities and any
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
politically related activity sponsored
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
by the candidate or for donations to
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations such Surplus
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
contributions however shall not be used
 
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
for personal purposes I believe
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative you nailed that okay
 
01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.149 align:start position:0%
representative you nailed that okay
impressive

01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
does it again it does it again
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
you sound surprised no I'm routinely
 
01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's the first 10 minutes of the
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
basketball game last night
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
please let's not go there
 
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
So reading this could you you couldn't
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
give it to your party
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
related activity sponsored by the
 
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.149 align:start position:0%
related activity sponsored by the
candidate

01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
so what does that mean well I don't it's
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
ambiguous so Surplus campaign
 
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
contributions may be used for general or
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
spectral election maybe just after a
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
general or special election fund for
 
01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:39.140 align:start position:0%
fundraising activities
 
01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:41.219 align:start position:0%
fundraising activity
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
I work less about Surplus yeah it was
 
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you um what to do about surplus
 
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
funds got it because it came up in my
 
01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
confusion of filing my own personal
 
01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.689 align:start position:0%
confusion of filing my own personal
campaign

01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
what do I do with it
 
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:05.870 align:start position:0%
what do I do with it
um

01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
so we all love it when election laws go
 
01:14:20.209 --> 01:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
to the courts
 
01:14:20.219 --> 01:14:21.430 align:start position:0%
to the courts
no

01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know if there's really no way to
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
write a campaign Finance law that
 
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't get no I I remember uh one of
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
the first things that chairman Griffin
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
told me
 
01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.330 align:start position:0%
told me
said

01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
Ross there's you should know you should
 
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
be aware there's three election law
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
committees there's the house the Senate
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't see it but I'm pretty sure
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
he talked about it about Surplus I was
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
just looking in his memo
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
oh from the Secretary of State I'm sure
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
they mentioned that what to do with
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
Surplus was a question that they get and
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
we can go back and ask but I I think we
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
still I still think we need to clarify
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
664 colon colon 4 dash B right
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
Surplus campaign contributions on page
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
so and then another question I had when
 
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
we were talking about loans and going
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
back and forth There's No Limit right
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
now and I'm not advocating we have one
 
01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
on an individual the amount of
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
self-funding by an individual it's not
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
clear to me
 
01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:52.100 align:start position:0%
how many people
 
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
report that
 
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
and if it's reportable and I guess my
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
thought would be from a transparency
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
standpoint not saying you can't find but
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
if you're going to sell fund that you
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
disclose that
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
I think you do have to disclose that
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
already it's on the Forum contributions
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
by candidate
 
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
you'd have to put it in yeah yeah you
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
can't just that was my impression too my
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
first campaign a couple years ago I made
 
01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
myself you know a small loan just to get
 
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
the bank account up and running but I
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
had a separate bank account right
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then I did repay that you know after
 
01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
the election but I reported all that
 
01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
so that was my understanding
 
01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
I don't bother with the loan I don't
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
think the money's coming back excuse me
 
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
set it in there I said I don't bother
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
with the loan because I don't think the
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
money's coming back
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
if I'm honest even with myself I I
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
always I always put in my own campaign
 
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
it makes it easier to have other people
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
give me money as a Tom look I'm invested
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
because you you're gonna get that 100 a
 
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
year job well I
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not limiting the discussion and
 
01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
that's not my job as a chairman of this
 
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
particular subcommittee but
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
we I think we've discussed
 
01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
the phases of the election cycle and
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
exploratory committees it seems like we
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
have a general sentiment here amongst us
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
that we could dispense with exploratory
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee as a category of political
 
01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:30.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
Primary in general
 
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
yeah in terms of contribution limits in
 
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
terms of campaign Finance contribution
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
limits yes one one we'll have to debate
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
what the total because at that point if
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
we go to singular status
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
we would have to have a debate on to
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
contribution limit would be from an
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
individual donor for singular status I I
 
01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.870 align:start position:0%
individual donor for singular status I I
think

01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
so so right now there's three phases at
 
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
five grand each right right if you get
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
rid of the phases
 
01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.770 align:start position:0%
rid of the phases
um

01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
you are you know we can't just go from
 
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand dollar contribution
 
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
limit to five thousand dollars yeah
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
right I would just make it 15. and then
 
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
30 for I mean you just want the total Rd
 
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
is I'll be optimistic and think that
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
keeping the total aggregate amount the
 
01:18:26.649 --> 01:18:26.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's way too optimistic I know right
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
but I think it makes sense that it if
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
on one phase that we had over three
 
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
phases then
 
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
no effective difference no practical
 
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.270 align:start position:0%
no effective difference no practical
change

01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
there is some practical change
 
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
um it does accomplish a political goal
 
01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:54.659 align:start position:0%
of mine which is to end the incumbent
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
protection plan that is our campaign
 
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
Finance laws
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
um and say that again emotionally it
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
helps end the incumbent protection plan
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
that is our campaign Finance laws how so
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
because by removing the three phases
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
right income non-incumbents tend to get
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
into the race later right incumbents who
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
are running again just re-up their
 
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
campaign immediately right oh yeah okay
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
so by eliminating that by getting rid of
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
the potential by the three phases you
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.410 align:start position:0%
the potential by the three phases you
allow

01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:23.420 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
non-incumbence basically access to the
 
01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
same not basically the access to the
 
01:19:29.689 --> 01:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
same level of resources that an
 
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
incumbent has
 
01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
even though they get into the Ritz later
 
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:36.590 align:start position:0%
even though they get into the Ritz later
um

01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
and you know how I feel about the
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
incumbent protection plans
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh which is hilarious given that I'm an
 
01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:42.910 align:start position:0%
uh which is hilarious given that I'm an
incumbent

01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
incumbent
 
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
all the time like why can't you fix this
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
like it's hard to get incumbents to get
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
rid of the income protection plan it's
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
you really have to you really have to
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
put your own selfishness so I was being
 
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
overly optimistic when I said it might
 
01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
not be controversial okay well I
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
actually I think it fairness standpoint
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
I think if that's what if you're driven
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
by Notions of
 
01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
fairness and and reducing barriers to
 
01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
participation it but not everyone's
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
driven by that
 
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's when it comes to this
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff I like and I'm an
 
01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
egalitarian I like it to be
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
okay I think that Prince Will Be by many
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
sympathizers I could I I would feel
 
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
comfortable defending that principle or
 
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
promoting it we're going to treat
 
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
and then you don't have to worry about
 
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
the you know if I were to run
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm running for governor not me the
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
state's not ready for that yeah thank
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
all right well
 
01:20:49.570 --> 01:20:49.580 align:start position:0%
okay so are we kind of I mean
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
we are going to I think representative
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
Whaley have a list
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a short list here of things
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
that seem to me uh
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh I kind of uh
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'm still getting this my thinking
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
organized on this but yeah Clarity
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
Clarity revisions
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
I had
 
01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
two sub bullets and a sub bullet for one
 
01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
of them uh first one refine and improve
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
the definitions we've identified some
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
definitions in our our first meeting I
 
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
and you've come up with a a beginning
 
01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:25.739 align:start position:0%
list which I haven't had time to read
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
yet but I will
 
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.250 align:start position:0%
yet but I will
uh

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
and then I have another category called
 
01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:32.209 align:start position:0%
and then I have another category called
removing

01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:32.219 align:start position:0%
removing
 
01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
internal contradictions that's just a
 
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.090 align:start position:0%
internal contradictions that's just a
working

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:36.470 align:start position:0%
working
label

01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
label
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh candidate versus candidate committee
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
I think a common set of reporting
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
deadlines for candidates and candidate
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
committees would it's kind of a low
 
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit when you look at what the
 
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
actual deadlines are for a political
 
01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
committee you know a candidate committee
 
01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
to report
 
01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's very close to the six
 
01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:59.030 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's very close to the six
month

01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
continuing requirement for a candidate
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
remember the table in uh make it all the
 
01:22:06.729 --> 01:22:06.739 align:start position:0%
same it should be like that's right
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
super low hanging fruit nobody should
 
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
have an objection to that
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
right basically I'd say you know the
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
make candidates
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
committees subject to the same six-month
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
continuing reporting requirement until
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
the balance
 
01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.130 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
and another one that should be is it was
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
some some seeming discrepancies
 
01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.310 align:start position:0%
some some seeming discrepancies
about

01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
the reporting period that you you have
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
to report on yeah it was uh some places
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's what was it was uh you have to
 
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
report for the period up and up till
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
Sunday and
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know some ambiguity as to what the
 
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
actual end date of the period you're
 
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
reporting on the following Wednesday
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
and so just make that period make Sunday
 
01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
the last day for each campaign Finance
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
system reporting period make it explicit
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
you know your reporting activity
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
through Sunday you know inclusive
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
maybe just put that word in
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
so you get you get a donation
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
or make an expense on Monday it doesn't
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
go on that report that's due on the
 
01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.410 align:start position:0%
go on that report that's due on the
Wednesday

01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
so you're looking like I'm not making
 
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
sense no that's just the current law
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
because you want to make it clear I want
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
to make it clear right I'm not changing
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
what I think the intent is but make one
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
of the things they told us in that
 
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
discussion we had with the Secretary of
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
State's office Secretary of State
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
Scanlon and Mr Fitch
 
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
was that they get a lot of questions
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
because in one place I don't it's in the
 
01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
list he gave us and one place it says
 
01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:51.110 align:start position:0%
list he gave us and one place it says
uh

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
I don't remember the exact wording maybe
 
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
someone else can find it but uh it was
 
01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
some it's not in the law it was in his
 
01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:00.290 align:start position:0%
some it's not in the law it was in his
list

01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.090 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
anyway just make it clear that your
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
reporting activity through the midnight
 
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
on the Sunday before the Wednesday
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
you're filing the report that should be
 
01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.110 align:start position:0%
you're filing the report that should be
easy

01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
easy
 
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:17.390 align:start position:0%
 
seven

01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
no three on page seven I'm clearly a
 
01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:27.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
such statements are filed and itemized
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
all receipts and expenditures since the
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
cutoff the statement under paragraph two
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
up until the Monday preceding the filing
 
01:24:56.159 --> 01:24:57.410 align:start position:0%
up until the Monday preceding the filing
and

01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.199 --> 01:25:04.850 align:start position:0%
 
6646

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2-a and then 664 6 looks
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
like Roman numeral one
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
requires report up to including the
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
Monday before the statement is due I
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't care if it's Sunday or Monday
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
but just make it the same wording in
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
both those
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh portions of the statute
 
01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.870 align:start position:0%
uh portions of the statute
right

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
no argument about that right right
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's an easy one
 
01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
and uh and we already touched on this
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
earlier you know we've got Financial
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
agent Fiscal Agent and treasurer pick
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
one I personally would say Financial
 
01:25:45.649 --> 01:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
agent but whatever pick one
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
there's easy things I mean
 
01:25:51.169 --> 01:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
and they are you know details but with
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
details that are causing people
 
01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.110 align:start position:0%
details that are causing people
confusion

01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
and increasing the workload of the
 
01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office also
 
01:25:58.260 --> 01:25:59.870 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office also
unnecessarily

01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh well we talk some
 
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh it's my thought
 
01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:11.530 align:start position:0%
uh it's my thought
about

01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:11.540 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
mandatory use of the online campaign
 
01:26:18.649 --> 01:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
Finance system now my view of it is
 
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
generally speaking that I think it's a
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
good idea again for so so the
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
information is more accessible to the
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
can be made more accessible to the
 
01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:27.890 align:start position:0%
can be made more accessible to the
public

01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
but we also I think have to make
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
provision for people who
 
01:26:36.169 --> 01:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
have uh difficulties with computer
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
skills or availability or
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
online access is
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of parts of the state I
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
think there are still many parts of the
 
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
state which do not have good internet
 
01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:48.169 align:start position:0%
state which do not have good internet
access

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
that's been worked on but anyway I think
 
01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
we have to make accommodations for
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
people who are in that kind of situation
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
because again we don't want to create
 
01:26:59.470 --> 01:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
barriers to participation so Mr
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative for us so yes
 
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
um and I think the way we do that is we
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
look at the financial
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
the threshold for filing
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
so if somebody takes in
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars they spent a thousand
 
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
dollars on their campaign for or
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
received uh receipts see yeah I thought
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
because you know I'm a big fan of or
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
right it's one or the other
 
01:27:26.639 --> 01:27:28.490 align:start position:0%
right it's one or the other
um

01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
if they reach that threshold then they
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
have to use the system
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
and my argument I was throwing a
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars out now we can we can
 
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
have that conversation with what it
 
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
should be but if you've taken in a
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of political money I
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
would argue that you have the
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
currently they don't have to you're not
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
required to file a report isn't it a
 
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars now was it raised it
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
was raised to a thousand expenditures or
 
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
receipts yes and if you don't have that
 
01:27:58.850 --> 01:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
level of activity you don't even have to
 
01:28:00.649 --> 01:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
file a report correct to begin with yes
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
and I make yeah and I would make the
 
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
other argument is under that amount
 
01:28:06.169 --> 01:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
active their activity is largely not
 
01:28:06.179 --> 01:28:08.090 align:start position:0%
active their activity is largely not
meaningful

01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
if the goal of the trans if the goal of
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
that the the purpose of the limit right
 
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
is so that the public has a vested
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
interest in knowing what's happening
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
right if you know I don't think
 
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:18.780 align:start position:0%
anybody's getting bought off for a
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a hundred dollar a
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
year job right it's a bigger shame on
 
01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
you sure
 
01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:32.410 align:start position:0%
you sure
foreign

01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:32.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
was a very powerful powerful powerful
 
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
tool right um but no it's whatever the
 
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:39.300 align:start position:0%
limit is I mean I I think if you don't
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
qualify for the limit and the limit's a
 
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
you know you probably if you if you've
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
taken in a thousand dollars of
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
expenditures you've probably in ever
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
seats you've probably had the
 
01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
sophistication to use the internet
 
01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:55.129 align:start position:0%
sophistication to use the internet
um

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
and the money to buy a computer
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
if you don't have one or at least a
 
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
small one that you can tablet
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
a tablet okay
 
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
yeah we can discuss whether the the
 
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar amount is
 
01:29:11.209 --> 01:29:11.219 align:start position:0%
quite high enough but yeah okay I'm
 
01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
seeing your point yeah
 
01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
I mean you could make that argument you
 
01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
could just say you know if you've
 
01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
whatever if it's over two thousand
 
01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
dollars then you have to use the online
 
01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.050 align:start position:0%
dollars then you have to use the online
system

01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
the point the point the justification
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
for the campaign Finance system being
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the public will be aware if there's
 
01:29:30.169 --> 01:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
a possibility of undue influence
 
01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and what I've suggested before for
 
01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.010 align:start position:0%
yeah and what I've suggested before for
the

01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.330 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
mandatory use of the online system is
 
01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
phasing in over the years
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
um State reps being last not because I
 
01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
preference ourself just because we're
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
the smallest races taking the least
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
01:29:58.010 --> 01:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
um but if I was if I was to set it
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
unilaterally it would be governor and
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
all packs
 
01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
um one cycle then the next cycle I would
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
do Council and state senate and then
 
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
finally six years out I would do state
 
01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.470 align:start position:0%
finally six years out I would do state
reps

01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
reps
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
just a phase in over time
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
um I was more aggressive if you want to
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
go more aggressive I'm happy to talk
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
about being more aggressive but that's
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
that would at least start walking Us in
 
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
the right direction if if we as a
 
01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
practical matter if we form a consensus
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
among this subcommittee and then the
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
full committee election law committee
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
agrees with us
 
01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
we still have roughly
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
300 and some 82 other people potentially
 
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
who also need to agree what I have found
 
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
is with dealing with our fellow members
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
is that when you put requirements on
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
them very far down the road they tend to
 
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
be a little more agreeable to them
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
because they think in their head oh that
 
01:30:56.689 --> 01:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
won't apply to me
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
oh because they will be running correct
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's a body that has 33 of the body
 
01:31:03.649 --> 01:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
turns over every year so in you know in
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
six years you've had the potential for
 
01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
nearly 100 turnover right that's
 
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
obviously not 100 tomorrow but you've
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
had right a significant percentage of
 
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
turnover because that hundred dollars a
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
year only goes 87 30 after taxes by the
 
01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:21.950 align:start position:0%
year only goes 87 30 after taxes by the
way

01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
in State Senate and in the packs for the
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
first one and then
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
executive Council and the Reps so I
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
would Swip out Swip out switch out the
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
Senate and the council
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
because uh the Senate yeah send the
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
council because remember we have to get
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate to vote for this too right so
 
01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
if we just it's a practical side the
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
other side of the body has to support
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
this so if if you just say hey I guess
 
01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
what you're going to start using the
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting they might go whoa
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
um if you give them two years to get
 
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
their ducks in a row
 
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
maybe that maybe their Senate Brands can
 
01:32:00.169 --> 01:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
then handle it and and the members of
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
the other chamber are also I think you
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
know part-time volunteers really right
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah they only get paid 100 a year too
 
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.209 --> 01:32:14.219 align:start position:0%
no comments
 
01:32:16.729 --> 01:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
so that would make
 
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
the first group in 2026
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
yeah the next group in 2028 and then the
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
house wraps
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
and I guess anybody else I can't
 
01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
remember is anybody else that falls into
 
01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
these into the County Commissioners
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's what I was wondering but anybody
 
01:32:36.169 --> 01:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
else County maybe not you know what I
 
01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
don't remember but sheriffs encounters
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else would come in in 2030. yeah
 
01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's only six G's
 
01:32:47.570 --> 01:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
um that we did hear a testimony from the
 
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office that they
 
01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
did not want mandatory enrollment this
 
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
cycle just right heads up
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
um we don't have we don't have to agree
 
01:32:55.850 --> 01:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
with that assessment from the Secretary
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
of State's office but well just to put
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
it out there I think the other handful
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
and redoing mention that and and Aaron's
 
01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
I remember things see I remember things
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
when they said
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
not feeling
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
so just something to think we don't have
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
to follow that guidance um we are
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
definitely able to do what we want
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
um but just again you were thinking uh
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
Governor starting when
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
in the 2026 2020 yeah that's why I like
 
01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:30.260 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
Pax starting first they're relatively I
 
01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:35.900 align:start position:0%
mean the packs actually make up a large
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
links but
 
01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:38.570 align:start position:0%
links but
um

01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
it keeps it keeps the legislative bodies
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
that would be averse to it away from it
 
01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
it uh that's where the bulk of the money
 
01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
is getting spent anyways so that that
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
covers the larger swath of money which
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
in theories will be these a smaller
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
number of the file links
 
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
more money less filings and then we roll
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
into less money more filings and the uh
 
01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
at the governor's
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
level and for PAX they are dealing with
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
enough money they can afford the staff
 
01:34:11.209 --> 01:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
to make sure they can meet the
 
01:34:11.219 --> 01:34:12.830 align:start position:0%
to make sure they can meet the
requirement

01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh my experience with the and I know
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're getting a new cfis system my
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
experience is that the cfis system is
 
01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:20.629 align:start position:0%
experience is that the cfis system is
faster

01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
faster
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
oh yeah it's actually easier to use I've
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
been using it and it's it's for the most
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
part it's got yeah there's got some
 
01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
quirks yeah but
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
um so where do you want to put executive
 
01:34:35.090 --> 01:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
Council on the first group or the second
 
01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
I put them in the first group okay the
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
first group I mean well the counselors
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
are raising some serious cash now I know
 
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
this is not and there's only five of
 
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
them there's only five of them I mean
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's counselors pulling in a
 
01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million dollars
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
um that's not nothing
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
you know the Senators they kind of
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
outside of the leadership okay they tend
 
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
to cap out around a hundred
 
01:34:59.570 --> 01:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
um obviously that goes up every single
 
01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
year just by virtue of inflation and
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff but it generally
 
01:35:05.209 --> 01:35:05.219 align:start position:0%
speaking by doing Governor Council on
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
all tax you covered the lar once again
 
01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:10.739 align:start position:0%
the biggest pool of money
 
01:35:10.739 --> 01:35:13.189 align:start position:0%
the biggest pool of money
um

01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
I mean in an Ideal World we would want
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
to I would say put House and Senate
 
01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.090 align:start position:0%
to I would say put House and Senate
together

01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
in the same year that's four years from
 
01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
now to figure it out but once again we
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
have to pitch that to our colleagues and
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes they can
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
just from a system trying
 
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
part of me is wondering you know if you
 
01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
bring on Four Is there big that big a
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
difference of bringing in 400 or 424
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
although it's more than that because
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's everybody else running so it's
 
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
going to be yeah 800 and just the
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
general yeah but the but but that's
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
assuming they get over a thousand
 
01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
dollars and yeah okay all right how many
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
state reps are raising more than a
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars not a lot of us well
 
01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
there are significant number who don't
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah I probably I would just say
 
01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
more don't than do you know most of
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
these guys and gals are just buying
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
their yard signs and a couple of palm
 
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
cards and moving on yeah
 
01:36:27.250 --> 01:36:27.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
the larger the districts the more
 
01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
competitive I mean it's like all things
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
in politics right the larger the
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
district the more competitive the
 
01:36:34.729 --> 01:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
district the more the campaign cash is
 
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
flowing well the larger the district the
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
more people you have to reach that's yep
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh you're not going to
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
reach I represent half a Senate District
 
01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:45.659 align:start position:0%
how big is your District 30 000
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
constituents and you're not gonna you're
 
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
not going to reach 30 000 doing door
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
knocking I've attempted yeah yeah I have
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
attempted uh I I door knocked the first
 
01:36:59.330 --> 01:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
time I ran in the flow I door knocked
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
myself 4 500 doors
 
01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:02.810 align:start position:0%
myself 4 500 doors
um

01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of but it's to be fair I have
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester so it's not like you know
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's not far to walk in between the
 
01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:13.689 align:start position:0%
it's not far to walk in between the
houses

01:37:13.689 --> 01:37:13.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
very few Russ very very few well they
 
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
did they didn't know him then
 
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry
 
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
oh fun fact second time out I got more
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
votes they loved it yeah old joke I
 
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
couldn't resist sorry he's our guy he's
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
our guy
 
01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:31.490 align:start position:0%
our guy
yes

01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
okay what else you were doing candidate
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
versus candidate committee and then we
 
01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:42.310 align:start position:0%
versus candidate committee and then we
got

01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
those 300 internal contradictions uh
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay make the same reporting deadlines
 
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
for candidates and candidate committees
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
make Sunday or
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
make the last day to report for the
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
succeeding the last day of activity to
 
01:37:59.570 --> 01:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
be reported for a given report make it
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
the same I think Sunday makes sense it's
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know Monday
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
I guess from what I remember from when I
 
01:38:08.930 --> 01:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
was a kid Sunday is officially the first
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
day of the week but in terms of economic
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
activity it still is kind of Monday
 
01:38:16.729 --> 01:38:16.739 align:start position:0%
right so I would go with I would go with
 
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
through Sunday
 
01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:19.910 align:start position:0%
through Sunday
uh

01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
and yeah Financial agent or
 
01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
or just one term I like treasure that's
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
what it's worth
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
I don't have a I don't have a preference
 
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
on which of those three examples that
 
01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
are currently in the statute we use
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
the United States Department of the
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
treasury not the United States
 
01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
Department of fiscal agents
 
01:38:44.810 --> 01:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
well everybody knows what a Treasurer is
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
pretty much I think it's a word in
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
common use the other thing that does
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
happen to that point is you'll see
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
they'll write on there I know we're
 
01:38:53.330 --> 01:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
going to work on the disclaimer Alliance
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
they'll write on their FA and then
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
they'll list the Fiscal Agent as a wink
 
01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:59.270 align:start position:0%
they'll list the Fiscal Agent as a wink
nod

01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
nod
 
01:39:00.530 --> 01:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's hard to do I don't know what you
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
would do for treasurer p-r-e-a-s period
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's it but that that's
 
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
obvious right fa is not obvious
 
01:39:10.850 --> 01:39:10.860 align:start position:0%
assuming we can't get my dream of not
 
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
having to list your Fiscal Agent and
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
your address on your disclaimers
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're getting there okay yeah actually
 
01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.129 align:start position:0%
we're getting there okay yeah actually
um

01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:19.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how to even enforce that
 
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
someone buys a bunch of signs they don't
 
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
put their name on it and they're
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
unconnected with a candidate and put
 
01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
them out is can you practically track in
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
a practical matter can you track that
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
person down who put the signs out but
 
01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's that's an issue for another day
 
01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:36.290 align:start position:0%
that's that's an issue for another day
uh

01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I'm taking a look
 
01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:48.350 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I'm taking a look
uh

01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
well another committee another political
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee type
 
01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
we discussed
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
a voluntary committee as for someone
 
01:39:58.129 --> 01:39:58.139 align:start position:0%
that's where a group
 
01:40:00.649 --> 01:40:00.659 align:start position:0%
is not obligated to register with the
 
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office
 
01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
so why do we even offer the opportunity
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
and the counter argument to not doing it
 
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
was that well at some some committees
 
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
find that useful in terms of their
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
fundraising to have some official status
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
but is that really
 
01:40:19.129 --> 01:40:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
do we need to add another type of
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
political committee to ease their
 
01:40:26.209 --> 01:40:26.219 align:start position:0%
fundraising I mean they it's kind of up
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
to them to to gain the confidence of
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
potential contributors I think
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
so is that one we could dispense with
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
which one it's there's one called a
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh
 
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah they just decide they want
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
to they want to and what we heard in the
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
discussion right was that some
 
01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.870 align:start position:0%
discussion right was that some
organizations

01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
find this helpful in soliciting donation
 
01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
you know contributions
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
but it yeah number seven on page four
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:41:02.159 --> 01:41:10.490 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

01:41:10.490 --> 01:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
right political committee voluntary
 
01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.050 align:start position:0%
right political committee voluntary
registration

01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
any segregated fund not required or not
 
01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
required to register and Report receipts
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
so can we is that one with that's
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
nine different this is on page one very
 
01:41:57.850 --> 01:41:57.860 align:start position:0%
first line in this write-up actually
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
issues one nine different types of
 
01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
registration is very complex
 
01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:10.189 align:start position:0%
registration is very complex
that

01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.199 --> 01:42:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
um no

01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
um no
 
01:42:14.450 --> 01:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
no I don't see one but the types are
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.209 --> 01:42:22.219 align:start position:0%
64 2 I think
 
01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:25.820 align:start position:0%
right now yeah
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
well I just said the explanation we had
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
for why there's apparently some
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
sentiment in favor of it
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
I think representative qualey said the
 
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
reasons they want to look more official
 
01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
for raising funds but I don't and I can
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
understand why that might be more
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
advantageous for some groups
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
without the explicit authorization you
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
can make the argument the Secretary of
 
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
State could reject the filing
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
so that could be another reason why it
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
was put in there
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think that they would but you
 
01:43:28.609 --> 01:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
could see that argument
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
oh you haven't met the threshold you
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
don't need a file
 
01:43:31.679 --> 01:43:37.330 align:start position:0%
don't need a file
exactly

01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
the committee type is re this is the
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
last sentence in the description the
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
full description as a voluntary
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
registration there is no deadline for
 
01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
registration however once registered
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
voluntary registration political
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee must comply with receipts and
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures for reporting requirements
 
01:43:56.810 --> 01:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
the committee type is revised to the
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
applicable type
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
if the committee's receipts and or
 
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
expenditures reach the level that
 
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
I think I mean I'm not adamant on this I
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
mean it's just I'm not seeing the need
 
01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
for it I I'm I'm fine deleting it I
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
don't see the point of it if our goal is
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
to streamline it what's the point I
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
guess can somebody make the argument
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
keeping it in
 
01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
I I don't know we can go back and ask
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State I mean if unless
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
there's an argument to keep it in this
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
is one of those without objections did
 
01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
somebody making notes on these things
 
01:44:35.159 --> 01:44:36.470 align:start position:0%
somebody making notes on these things
because

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:39.659 align:start position:0%
thank you the president alert is quickly
 
01:44:39.659 --> 01:44:41.090 align:start position:0%
thank you the president alert is quickly
writing

01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
writing
 
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
I say that with all love
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
yeah another item I had in the list was
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
previous election cycle contributions
 
01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:03.649 align:start position:0%
previous election cycle contributions
and

01:45:03.649 --> 01:45:03.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
it had to do with uh
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
limiting them to
 
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh satisfying debt that had been
 
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
incurred and I think and your point on
 
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
that so I'll go over this one more time
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
to fix it in my mind
 
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
you're concern about that was
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter
 
01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
you're you're not aware of anyone
 
01:45:27.649 --> 01:45:27.659 align:start position:0%
besides a candidate that loans to a
 
01:45:30.169 --> 01:45:30.179 align:start position:0%
campaign it just doesn't happen
 
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
very often if at all in my 12 years of
 
01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh reading Finance campaign Finance
 
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
reports yep um which there may be one
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
other person in the state who's read
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
that as many as much as I have the other
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
person is probably in the room uh I am
 
01:45:43.729 --> 01:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
not aware of a single instance in which
 
01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
a loan has been given to a candidacy
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
that wasn't from the candidate were you
 
01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
just a moment ago referring to someone
 
01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
else as the resident nerd
 
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
yes did I hear that right oh okay just
 
01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.290 align:start position:0%
yes did I hear that right oh okay just
curious

01:45:54.290 --> 01:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
curious
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
I love reading campaign Finance reports
 
01:45:59.209 --> 01:45:59.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sick in the head like that
 
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
your way of addressing that concern
 
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
was to set a deadline by which a
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
candidate has to have those repay those
 
01:46:13.850 --> 01:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
loans correct no other no contribute
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
basically whatever the deadline is no
 
01:46:18.109 --> 01:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
contribution after that day can be put
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
towards repaying that loan the loan is
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
effectively at that point what the
 
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
remainder of that loan is converted to a
 
01:46:26.209 --> 01:46:26.219 align:start position:0%
contribution from the candidate
 
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
which doesn't violate any limits because
 
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
there are no limits on candidate
 
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
contributions to their own campaigns
 
01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:32.510 align:start position:0%
contributions to their own campaigns
correct

01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
I think that that sounds reasonable we
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
can discuss the details of how long they
 
01:46:39.530 --> 01:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
would have but I I would make it a day
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
you know but I also wouldn't make it
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
unlimited like it is now or it could be
 
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
interpreted to be now
 
01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:48.950 align:start position:0%
interpreted to be now
yeah

01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
giving a state certain a a defined
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
period after the election that is
 
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.090 align:start position:0%
period after the election that is
reasonable

01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a year
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
again we we can find something that's
 
01:47:08.209 --> 01:47:08.219 align:start position:0%
reasonable reasonable I can debate we
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
can we won't do it today but we can
 
01:47:11.450 --> 01:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
debate what reasonable is we don't need
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
to figure that out today
 
01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:16.139 align:start position:0%
all right I think that that approach
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
so far sounds
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.729 --> 01:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
that was just on my list that we hadn't
 
01:47:33.890 --> 01:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
you know that I had so far
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
and that's a transparency issue too so I
 
01:47:38.450 --> 01:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
mean I feel like yeah I feel like all
 
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
science can walk away from that with the
 
01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
science can walk away from that with the
Wind

01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:40.390 align:start position:0%
Wind
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:45.229 align:start position:0%
Wind
[Music]

01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
would the committee be interested in
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
soliciting comments from members of the
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
public who are present or sure or uh
 
01:48:00.410 --> 01:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
baby representative from the Secretary
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
of State's office
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
fellow fellow campaign Finance nerds you
 
01:48:06.050 --> 01:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
know this really gets people you know
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
people get really excited about campaign
 
01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:08.570 align:start position:0%
people get really excited about campaign
Finance

01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
01:48:10.729 --> 01:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
it's really it's a it's a real
 
01:48:12.649 --> 01:48:12.659 align:start position:0%
you know well I'm finding it interesting
 
01:48:14.209 --> 01:48:14.219 align:start position:0%
third rail of New Hampshire politics
 
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
does that mean does that mean I'm uh
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
one of the resident marriage then
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
probably by virtue of sitting on this
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
committee we are all the residential
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
nerds when our own committee members are
 
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
like oh I don't know if I want to send a
 
01:48:28.970 --> 01:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
campaign Financial like ah yeah
 
01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:31.010 align:start position:0%
campaign Financial like ah yeah
yeah

01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
well that's consistent being a nerd on
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
this committee is
 
01:48:36.649 --> 01:48:36.659 align:start position:0%
consistent with the rest of my life
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
history so
 
01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
no complaints
 
01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:43.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going to invite uh Secretary of

if you have some thoughts you'd like to
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
share with us having listened to our
 
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.490 align:start position:0%
share with us having listened to our
discussion

01:48:52.490 --> 01:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
we have uh 26 minutes before the meeting
 
01:48:56.100 --> 01:49:01.129 align:start position:0%
we have uh 26 minutes before the meeting
ends

01:49:01.129 --> 01:49:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
thanks for
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
your diligence continuing to look at
 
01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
this uh secretary Scanlon did want me to
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
let you know that he is continuing to
 
01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
work on possible suggestions to
 
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
um especially the definition section and
 
01:49:18.169 --> 01:49:18.179 align:start position:0%
what a committee is and
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
what the options are
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
um and just listening to your past
 
01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:25.139 align:start position:0%
discussion on debt I just want to remind
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
the committee that there is other forms
 
01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
of debt other than loans sometimes bills
 
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
for your campaign don't come in right
 
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
away especially when you've hired staff
 
01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:36.010 align:start position:0%
away especially when you've hired staff
or

01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:36.020 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
there'll be a time period where there'll
 
01:49:39.370 --> 01:49:39.380 align:start position:0%
be other
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
debts that come in that are not self
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
loans to your committee
 
01:49:45.649 --> 01:49:45.659 align:start position:0%
um but there but that there should be a
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
time period where that election cycle
 
01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
ends and the next one begins
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
so when you're looking at dates for
 
01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:56.900 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance reporting online
 
01:49:59.450 --> 01:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
whatever that date is
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
for the 2026 cycle perhaps it's November
 
01:50:06.169 --> 01:50:06.179 align:start position:0%
30th of 24 that that reporting online
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
has to start
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
um just thinking thinking of all
 
01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
the information that you have to digest
 
01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
and require for
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
those who are required to use the online
 
01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system so whatever you
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
set as the end date of an election cycle
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:31.729 --> 01:50:31.739 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take some questions take
 
01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
some questions back to the office I see
 
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
your point on that the November the 2026
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
elections right Naturals
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
a natural start of that election cycle
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
would be after the general election in
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
2024 which is what we were discussing
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
earlier that was my thinking
 
01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
and I think to the our voluntary
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
comments sometimes somebody voluntarily
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
submits information it's not a committee
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's just that they think they're going
 
01:51:02.209 --> 01:51:02.219 align:start position:0%
to spend more than a thousand dollars so
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
they voluntarily self-report before that
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
deadline is
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
or that threshold is met so
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
um that's what the voluntarily reporting
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
comment was made from our office at so
 
01:51:18.290 --> 01:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
if you voluntarily report your expenses
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
expenses and contributions before the
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar limit
 
01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
you have to continue to report those
 
01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
even though you haven't met the thousand
 
01:51:33.169 --> 01:51:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:35.570 --> 01:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
for example someone who's a candidate
 
01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.310 align:start position:0%
for example someone who's a candidate
yes

01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:51:41.209 --> 01:51:41.219 align:start position:0%
any any across the board any anyone
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
but any of those committee types
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
political committee types could do yes
 
01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
anyone could do that so we don't
 
01:51:52.490 --> 01:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
okay so again I'm not seeing a need for
 
01:51:54.649 --> 01:51:54.659 align:start position:0%
a special
 
01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
oh no it's not a special type of
 
01:51:58.250 --> 01:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
committee it's just right but we it's
 
01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
the list requirements of reporting that
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
they're required to do and the list from
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
we we got from the Mr Fish prepared
 
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
which I'm going to say again has been
 
01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
very very useful he listed that as one
 
01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
of the nine types of political committee
 
01:52:15.169 --> 01:52:15.179 align:start position:0%
that's defined
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
and we're it's looking to be even more
 
01:52:20.930 --> 01:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
so since your comments that that is
 
01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:22.850 align:start position:0%
so since your comments that that is
redundant

01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's you know and I apologize they don't
 
01:52:26.330 --> 01:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
have that cheat in front of me but I
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
think the voluntary thing could apply to
 
01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
any of them and once that threshold's
 
01:52:34.729 --> 01:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
met then we have to Define which type of
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
um representative Lane thank you
 
01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
um on the mandatory use of the filing
 
01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:50.450 align:start position:0%
um on the mandatory use of the filing
system

01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.790 --> 01:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
you heard what we were proposing like to
 
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
phase it in but does that make sense to
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
you is that something from your offices
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
like administrative
 
01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
I think makes sense or do you want to
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
get back to us on that or I think
 
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
whatever you decide as the the deadlines
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
would be fine that's your policy
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
decision so
 
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
but we'll have the system
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
the new system up and operating and
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
ready to take all of them okay if that's
 
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
what you decide
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure we
 
01:53:26.570 --> 01:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:28.030 align:start position:0%
 
deadline

01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:53:31.090 --> 01:53:31.100 align:start position:0%
we have another question
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that secretary Scanlon is
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
working on definitions
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
um if we come up with them because I'm
 
01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
kind of should we give those to him
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
should we wait have a working session
 
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
with him or what would he prefer do you
 
01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
know or should we get back
 
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to bring them to the next
 
01:53:52.729 --> 01:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
meeting or meet with somebody individual
 
01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
beforehand so okay whatever works best
 
01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
for the committee I'm I'm not sure that
 
01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
we're really quite ready okay yeah but
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
if he has some ideas that would be great
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
so um yeah because I did a couple but I
 
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
and and we understand that the Secretary
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
of State's office
 
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
always works very well to carry out the
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
policy decisions of the legislature but
 
01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:24.500 align:start position:0%
we still like hearing your opinions
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I personally don't like fax
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
machines but that's me personally
 
01:54:34.570 --> 01:54:34.580 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about a 12 point font
 
01:54:39.010 --> 01:54:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
Deputy Hennessey no
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
01:54:51.770 --> 01:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh we have some time
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh does anyone else want to that's what
 
01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
that's about to ask okay is there anyone
 
01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
else any members of the public that have
 
01:54:59.450 --> 01:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
some thoughts they would like to share
 
01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:00.659 align:start position:0%
with us would be interested to hear them
 
01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:03.300 align:start position:0%
if not that's fine too
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not seeing a rush to the
 
01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:07.669 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not seeing a rush to the
microphone

01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to step up to the
 
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
microphone even if you're being nice you
 
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
have to do it from the microphones
 
01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
people at home okay nice that you are
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
someone's saying something nice we
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
really want them on right yes definitely
 
01:55:28.129 --> 01:55:28.139 align:start position:0%

01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
it up and put your hand in the Bible
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
so to repeat myself I'm very
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
appreciative of what you're doing Bob
 
01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
Perry the counter Stratford
 
01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:39.290 align:start position:0%
Perry the counter Stratford

um
 
01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:42.659 align:start position:0%
this might be a mod the give and take is
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
terrific so
 
01:55:47.450 --> 01:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm very appreciative of what you're
 
01:55:49.970 --> 01:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
doing well thank you for your thoughts
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:55:54.290 --> 01:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
it's it's my view that with a small
 
01:55:57.890 --> 01:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
group like that the point is to have a
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
coherent discussion and I think we're
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
achieving that without the formality
 
01:56:05.810 --> 01:56:05.820 align:start position:0%
that's typical and I would say needed in
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
a full committee meeting and we'll
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
continue to do it this way as long as it
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
works on this subcommittee
 
01:56:14.050 --> 01:56:14.060 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
it's a testament to the chairman and the
 
01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
person who picked the chairman oh
 
01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:20.090 align:start position:0%
person who picked the chairman oh
absolutely

01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
oh well if you don't have a sense of
 
01:56:42.890 --> 01:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
humor life is a lot harder
 
01:56:45.050 --> 01:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
are there any other topics that we think
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's worth discussing that that we need
 
01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
to discuss today
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have to stay until 12.
 
01:56:54.109 --> 01:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
I'm good in fact I have somebody wants
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
to meet at 11 45 so I'd love it if we
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
pieced out okay so I'm going to
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
reiterate what I said at the beginning
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
of the meeting because I like
 
01:57:01.850 --> 01:57:01.860 align:start position:0%
reiterating because most people don't
 
01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:03.659 align:start position:0%
well never mind we'll won't go there
 
01:57:05.209 --> 01:57:05.219 align:start position:0%
about how often people listen but anyway
 
01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.139 align:start position:0%
I'm going to schedule our next meeting
 
01:57:08.689 --> 01:57:08.699 align:start position:0%
for two weeks from today
 
01:57:10.930 --> 01:57:10.940 align:start position:0%
that'll be the 13th
 
01:57:13.129 --> 01:57:13.139 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm going to schedule one more
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
meeting after that not necessarily the
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
final meeting but another meeting for
 
01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
the 27th
 
01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:20.990 align:start position:0%
the 27th
and

01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:57:25.129 --> 01:57:25.139 align:start position:0%
we've had this is our fourth meeting
 
01:57:26.930 --> 01:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
so we've had a lot of opportunity to
 
01:57:30.649 --> 01:57:30.659 align:start position:0%
discuss this and find the areas of
 
01:57:30.659 --> 01:57:34.550 align:start position:0%
discuss this and find the areas of
agreement

01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:41.089 --> 01:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.169 --> 01:57:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:46.850 --> 01:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
oh don't threaten me with a good time
 
01:57:49.010 --> 01:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
they were very nice and explained what
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
the delay was and um and they're working
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
on it okay and that would work well for
 
01:57:55.850 --> 01:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
us because then the meeting after that
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
we could start maybe aiming towards what
 
01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
a report would look like
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to say it one more time
 
01:58:05.209 --> 01:58:05.219 align:start position:0%
because I think it's important
 
01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
I I think we're all agreed we're looking
 
01:58:09.169 --> 01:58:09.179 align:start position:0%
for the air well agreed we're looking
 
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
for the areas of agreement that we can
 
01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:12.589 align:start position:0%
for the areas of agreement that we can
pursue

01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
pursue
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that we think our colleagues will
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
also agree with
 
01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
two meetings at least
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
and we'll start to think about
 
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
generating a report
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
that it'll be the same time 10 A.M
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
Tuesday the 13th and the 27th
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
that work for everybody
 
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
yep thank you okay thank you Mr chairman
 
01:58:41.810 --> 01:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
okay in the absence of uh
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
desire for further discussion I will
 
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
adjourn this meeting at
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.480 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
