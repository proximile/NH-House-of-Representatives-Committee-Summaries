00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
how the transmission is done so you've
 

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.350 align:start position:0%
how the transmission is done so you've
got<00:09:31.760><c> two</c><00:09:32.000><c> facilities</c>

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%

that<00:09:33.600><c> are</c><00:09:33.760><c> using</c><00:09:34.080><c> the</c><00:09:34.240><c> same</c>

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
that are using the same
 

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.949 align:start position:0%
that are using the same

00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
transmission but they are separate
 

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:38.949 align:start position:0%
transmission but they are separate

00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
facilities and so the problem is then
 

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:40.470 align:start position:0%
facilities and so the problem is then
they<00:09:39.040><c> get</c><00:09:39.200><c> counted</c><00:09:39.600><c> as</c><00:09:39.680><c> one</c><00:09:39.920><c> and</c><00:09:40.000><c> they</c><00:09:40.240><c> they</c><00:09:40.320><c> go</c>

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
they get counted as one and they they go
 

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.470 align:start position:0%
they get counted as one and they they go
over<00:09:40.640><c> the</c><00:09:40.800><c> cap</c><00:09:41.120><c> so</c><00:09:41.279><c> i</c><00:09:41.519><c> and</c><00:09:41.680><c> that</c><00:09:41.920><c> to</c><00:09:42.080><c> me</c><00:09:42.240><c> seemed</c>

do what we want to do
 

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:04.630 align:start position:0%
do what we want to do
and<00:20:02.240><c> then</c><00:20:02.799><c> that's</c><00:20:03.120><c> that</c><00:20:03.280><c> would</c><00:20:03.440><c> be</c><00:20:03.520><c> a</c><00:20:03.600><c> way</c><00:20:03.760><c> to</c>

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then that's that would be a way to
 

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.870 align:start position:0%
and then that's that would be a way to
not<00:20:04.880><c> have</c><00:20:05.039><c> the</c><00:20:05.200><c> whole</c><00:20:05.360><c> building</c><00:20:05.679><c> just</c><00:20:05.919><c> die</c>
