00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody
 
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to convene the committee of
 
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
conference on house bill 624.
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
you will note that there are three house
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
members and three senate members in
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
attendance the fourth house member
 
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative notter
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
apparently confused the dates
 
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
in her mind and is currently on her way
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
to vermont
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
so she will not be joining us i think
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
she agreed already
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm kidding for this committee of
 
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
i'm kidding for this committee of
conference

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
so let's get started
 
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.430 align:start position:0%
so let's get started
the

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
house obviously non-concurred with the

amendment

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
drafted by the senate
 
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
the senate to remove
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
section 5 of its amendment
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
the section that
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
specifically refers to
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
net energy metering hydroelectric
 
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.590 align:start position:0%
net energy metering hydroelectric
generators

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
generators
 
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.830 align:start position:0%

362-a colon 9.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
the reason we're asking the senate to
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
remove that section
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
is that two house committees heard
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
624. and
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
two separate committees s t and e and
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
but no house committee heard the senate
 
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.029 align:start position:0%
but no house committee heard the senate
amendment

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
specifically the section 5 that i
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
referred to a minute ago
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the house never had a chance to
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
or even vote on the bill one way or the
 
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.430 align:start position:0%
or even vote on the bill one way or the
other

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
and we believe that there are many
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions that remain unasked and
 
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.749 align:start position:0%
questions that remain unasked and
unanswered

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
unanswered
 
00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.029 align:start position:0%
unanswered
about

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
the section five in the amendment
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
questions that the house never got a
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
chance to ask for example
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
how much will it cost
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
will brookfield cease operations without
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
this change
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
is it possible brookfield could make
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
other arrangements
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
what compelling need exists for this
 
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.990 align:start position:0%
what compelling need exists for this
legislation

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
why was this amendment offered at the
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
and there are other questions as well
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
there's some senate language that was
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
added about energy storage for example
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
and representative herron has some
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
there's a further wrinkle here too and
 
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
that is that the house
 
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.110 align:start position:0%
that is that the house
can't

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.230 align:start position:0%
can't
cannot

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
consider legislation legislation that
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
impacts costs without
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
first hearing that legislation in the
 
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.110 align:start position:0%
first hearing that legislation in the
house

00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i know there's disagreement about
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
whether net metering shifts costs or not
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
but if it does that could impact state
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
and municipal budgets
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
and it
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
a consideration like that would prevent
 
00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:15.830 align:start position:0%
a consideration like that would prevent
the

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
house from even
 
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.950 align:start position:0%
house from even
considering

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
considering
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
so as a result of all this the house
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
believes that
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
the section 5 of the amendment if that
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
was deleted we could move forward with
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
and that is the house position at this
 
00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.750 align:start position:0%
and that is the house position at this
point

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
so i would like to hear from the senate
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
your reaction to our
 
00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:47.829 align:start position:0%
your reaction to our
request

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
well um
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
senator yeah i'll say a couple words
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
rose um
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
as we discussed earlier i understand the
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
position and the issues of the house on
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
this whole matter and also matters of
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
process and i just thought i'd offer a
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
couple of thoughts
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
it was our feeling that
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
what we went through on 315 and 91 last
 
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.990 align:start position:0%
what we went through on 315 and 91 last
year

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
that we certainly
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
were attempting to make sure that the
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
the increase in the cap
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
would be applicable where it
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
appropriately could be and that here you
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
know i call what you want a glitch or a
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
just a a methodology of how the wiring
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
how the transmission is done so you've
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
got two facilities
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
that are using the same
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
transmission but they are separate
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
facilities and so the problem is then
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
they get counted as one and they they go
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
over the cap so i and that to me seemed
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
like kind of a technical change that we
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know the intent and what we worked
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
on 315 and 91
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
dealt with so in terms of the house not
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
hearing this particular thing well in a
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
way you know it felt it did last year
 
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.630 align:start position:0%
way you know it felt it did last year
now

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
two other things on
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
the cost shift potential
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
it does seem to me that the directions
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
that were given to the puc last year to
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
look into the cost shifting issue
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
um and that you know we had the
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee and then the direction to the
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
pec to kind of look into that more
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
generally which i don't know what now is
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
91 or 315 we put that in but that that
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
work is underway and i would assume that
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
would include
 
00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:22.389 align:start position:0%
would include
um

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
this as well
 
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.030 align:start position:0%
this as well
um

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of the questions that are asked
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
again looking back to
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
the process we did on i guess it was 315
 
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.590 align:start position:0%
the process we did on i guess it was 315
um

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
where the decision was made to ask those
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
questions towards
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
the poc and that's what we did the last
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
time could do it here it seems to me for
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
one the ones that you enumerated um and
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i think also
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
the kind of questions about uh
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know the costs and so on that it
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i like cooking cans down the road
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
more than anybody else does but that's
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
why we're here most of the time isn't it
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
um you know that it seemed to me to be
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
possible if you want those questions
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
asked to put in a
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
time period under which this arrangement
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
is good i mean give it a couple years
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that way the questions could be
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
answered either through the existing puc
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
or some more language added to this
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
that would do that so that those are
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
my thoughts of you know why we ended up
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
at our position aside from saying that
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
this is you know the the issue of these
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
plants is very important to the senate
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh could you
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
one of you refresh my memory from this
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
public hearing that we had in the senate
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
section five portion of the amendment
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
what was the answer to the question of
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
why this amendment was offered so late
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the process do any of you remember
 
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
in the process do any of you remember
that

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh i don't remember that being worded
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
that way white was being authored so
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
late i do recall you um
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
agreeing to it
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
and then we asked you to come to the mic
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
because we didn't record it and then
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
with the mic
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
that is true i did agree that
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
it seemed like a reasonable proposal
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
and then when we had discussions in the
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
house about it
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
all these questions arose that
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
none of us could answer
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
and so that altered our thinking about
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
i still don't understand why waiting to
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
introduce new legislation next fall
 
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.670 align:start position:0%
introduce new legislation next fall
would

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
significant impact on
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
this going forward
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
a few months delay doesn't seem like a
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
lot to me
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge leaves with with
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
individuals if they do not come back
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
you have to start the conversation all
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
fun stuff to do it's not something that
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
you retain it's something that that
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
comes along with the institution of
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been working on
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
this for years
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
we thought we had an agreement last year
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
we fixed some things we just needed to
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
torque it that's all we were trying to
 
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.350 align:start position:0%
torque it that's all we were trying to
do

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.470 align:start position:0%
do
and

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
um there is an amendment
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
that i forwarded to i don't know if you
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
if you want i mean
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's lengthy but if you uh
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
if you take time to look at it
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think it addresses some of the issues
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
that you you're concerned with but
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
it seems as though you know um
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve something here
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
and you can raise a thousand questions
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
in in torpedo something which i think is
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
is this amendment something
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
newly created
 
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.110 align:start position:0%
newly created
yeah

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
oh so this is not the amendment that was
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
passed by the senate oh okay
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
maybe while we're doing that i have also
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions that maybe
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
can be looked at it appears what this is
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
saying is it applies to
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
um hydro facilities who were operational
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
before july 1st 2021
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
i guess the first thing i'd like to know
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
is how many of those are there how much
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about here two 150
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
or is it just a special interest bill
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
for one particular company second that
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
provision of july first 2021 doesn't
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
seem to apply to energy energy storage
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
facilities so
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
the way i read this is that whatever how
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
many of these places existed they could
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
go in and put in 10 15 energy storage
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
facilities as long as they were all less
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
than one megawatt and then they could be
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
dispatched whenever at the rate of 15 20
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
megawatts if there was many that many of
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
them there
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
at one time
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
so again it seems like energy storage
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
facilities aren't covered by this 925
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
line 25 line twenty five okay
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
nothing expectation shall be deemed to
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
approve or allow or participate in
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
energy storage facilities in energy
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
metering unless otherwise approved or
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
allowed by law
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
then what's the point of having if it's
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
that's if it sounds like to me the law
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
already approves it right up there where
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
it says energy storage facilities so now
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
you're saying if the law doesn't say it
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
then they're not deemed to be approved
 
00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:50.629 align:start position:0%
then they're not deemed to be approved
but

00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
listed in line seven they certainly are
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
approved because they're listed right
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
there you can't have it both ways the
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
other question i have is how are these
 
00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.749 align:start position:0%
other question i have is how are these
uh

00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
items dispatched by iso if you get
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
accumulation of i don't know six ten
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
fifteen megawatts being uh put on the
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
grid at one time how does iso treat them
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
do they treat them as a generator
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh because they're over five megawatts
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
and they have leadering concerns that
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
have to be addressed and so forth are
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
they treated like net metering as six
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
individual or ten individual
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
one megawatt facilities they answer your
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
first question there's only a couple of
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
hydros that that we're addressing here
 
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.749 align:start position:0%
hydros that that we're addressing here
and

00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
we know that so i'm not gonna play games
 
00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:32.550 align:start position:0%
we know that so i'm not gonna play games
here

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
um i think you're trying to kill the
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
bill specifically
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
if i if i may miss you um
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead now um
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of your question about the incl
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
the what the amendment does the first
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
part in the second part um the inclusion
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
of energy storage facilities
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
up above
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
says they're eligible
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
for the net metering but down below
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
it says well yes they're eligible but
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
they can't it can't happen unless
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
there's an approval the approval process
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
so i think it needs to be up top so that
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
they're listed as eligible but the
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
procedure as to whether or not it's done
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
is down is down below sorry i'm a little
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
confused senator on that one because it
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
seems to be saying they're eligible but
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
then and less deemed approved right or
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
allowed the participation in net media
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
during unless otherwise approved or
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
allowed by law what this is a law that
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
allows them or an order or decision
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
issued or ruled adopted by the
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy or the public
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
utilities commission so it sounds as if
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're already allowed by law and now
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying we have to have an
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
additional law to do it or the puc or
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
doe has to come in and approve it i
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
guess that
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh the difference is that the word
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
well that's part of the reason i don't
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
like medvilles like this they don't have
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
time to bet because i'm still not sure
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
what it says and also does anybody know
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
how they're dispatched from the by the
 
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
how they're dispatched from the by the
iso

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
no my question is this is characteristic
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
of the kind of questions that remain
 
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.830 align:start position:0%
of the kind of questions that remain
unanswered

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
unanswered
 
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.870 align:start position:0%
unanswered
and

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
give the house
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about whether we should
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
move forward at this time
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
we feel that it would be appropriate to
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
bring this bill forward in the fall
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
or next session so that the full house
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
can have a chance to
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
weigh in on these issues ask these
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
questions get these answers
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
and make a determination about whether
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
or not this is good policy to move
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
well i may if i may make one more
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
comment on that um it was asked earlier
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
about the timeliness and i think in the
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
hearing report on pages five and six
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
some of that gets addressed and that
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
they then we passed 91
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
and they merely went about their
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
business working with eversource
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh to implement and they discovered that
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
there were some issues
 
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.549 align:start position:0%
there were some issues
that

00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
the legislation needed to clear up so
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
that process had to stop
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
so that's that's why this fix here
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
let's what we had thought the intent of
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
91 would be to go forward
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
um now and and uh mr chairman i
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
i you know here it is it's what is it
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
may whatever and um
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know we have the opportunity to
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
walk away with the opportunity to try to
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
do something and um
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
it just it does seem to me that it would
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
be possible to put in here
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
shall be effective until a certain date
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
and that lets lets them get going and
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
get the negotiations finished
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know it uh
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
then we'd have a chance to take as many
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
more bites at the apples we want next
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
time and some of those questions would
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
likely be answered in the proceedings at
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
the puc and elsewhere over it so
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
it could you know we could say that um a
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
repeal date on that paragraph of what do
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
you want you know 2024 july 1st 2024
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
something like that it gets this gives
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
us two years of the session to
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
do what we want to do
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then that's that would be a way to
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
so you're suggesting then that
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
under six effective date
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
we change
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
the language to indicate that section
 
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.110 align:start position:0%
the language to indicate that section
five

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
would take
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
effect on
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
on passage but then it would repeal
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
it would sunset
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
two years after
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
and that way they could do what they got
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
um make the case that if the case needs
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
to be made there will be probably some
 
00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:39.430 align:start position:0%
to be made there will be probably some
poc

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
poc
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
we'll get a report about the cost
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
shifting from the puc we'll this
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
some of these dockets might come forward
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
to prove
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
this power and um i think we ought to
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
we're gonna need to talk to heidi take a
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
little recess just to chat with her
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
about what i'm proposing because maybe
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'm done proposing something it's just
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
gonna make her pull out her hair but uh
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
um it would be a way to get us through
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
today and
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
i know you care about the first part of
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
it is now 10 20. let's take a break
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
until 10 30.
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.440 --> 00:27:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.720 --> 00:30:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%

you

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%

you

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay everyone thank you very much we're
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to resume this committee of
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
conference after
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
a lengthy break and some lengthy
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
discussions about the issues involved
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
and senator waters i want to thank you
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
for your compromise suggestion of adding
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
a two-year sunset provision to this
 
00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.150 align:start position:0%
a two-year sunset provision to this
legislation

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
however it doesn't seem that that would
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
really buy much for this legislation
