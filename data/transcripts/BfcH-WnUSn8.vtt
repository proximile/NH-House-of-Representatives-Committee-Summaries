committee for October 28th and uh the
 
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
chair appoints the vice chair as clerk
 
00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
because he did such a good job last time
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
and so would you call the roll
 
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.250 align:start position:0%
and so would you call the roll
um

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 align:start position:0%

welcome
 
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
so I can do this while you're I think we
 
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
have form I guess I think we do too all
 
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
right well yeah two three
 
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
first order of our business is to
 
00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 align:start position:0%
approve the minutes of
 
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
the meeting of September 16
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
and it looks like this
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
you should have moved to prove puppies
 
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
and take a minute to review it if you
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
have not reviewed it already
 
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
remember when we approve minutes we
 
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't change things that have
 
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
subsequently happened the question is is
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
this a true rendering of the meeting
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.450 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:56.290 align:start position:0%
okay
foreign

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh has been the clerk
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
and he is absent today so put a big a
 
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
anybody need further time representative
 
00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.170 align:start position:0%
anybody need further time representative
Nelson

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 align:start position:0%
Nelson
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman uh in the minutes it
 
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 align:start position:0%
mentions that I had it
 
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
rough information what I said at the
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
last meeting and I did not get it in
 
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
time but I have copies here thank you
 
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
very much could you pass them out sure
 
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:51.370 align:start position:0%
 
the question

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
anything else anyone can I have a moment
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
I I have a procedural question okay when
 
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
when we when we do our minutes we just
 
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
added representative oh well I think
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
we're on the verge of adding
 
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson supple moment and
 
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
then it's how do we how does the public
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
see the minutes particularly in this
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
case with representative Nelson adding
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
something during the meeting
 
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
good morning uh for the record John
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
Williams legislative director for the
 
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
which is an executive branch agency but
 
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
here to at least provide some
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
information on the retention of the
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
records with this committee which is a
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
legislative branch obviously committee
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
the currently the draft minutes remain
 
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
draft minutes they're certainly
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
available and subject to inspection By
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
Request up into point of time that they
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
are available within five days of your
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
convening and as such the public would
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
have access to making a request for that
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
within that time period prior to you
 
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:30.500 align:start position:0%
taking action to adopting minutes today
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
so therefore these are not published on
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
the Committee website but that's not
 
00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:38.459 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with oh I'll strike that
 
00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:40.019 align:start position:0%
you should consult with your own
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys regarding the consistency and
 
00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:44.899 align:start position:0%
how that should be published but it is
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
consistent with the practice that this
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee has been doing for many years
 
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
now as to represent Nelson's addendum to
 
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
that this is obviously an item of first
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
impression to the committee uh and uh
 
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
but certainly you could take you could
 
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
consider taking action on the underlying
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
minutes and adopting those minutes
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
presuming with no other changes but then
 
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019 align:start position:0%
taking further action on representative
 
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
Nelson's minutes if you're not
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that and you would like
 
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
the public to have an extended period to
 
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
reviewing that you could certainly hold
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
off and taking action on the meeting
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
from September 16th and have a vote on
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
your next meeting which I believe is
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
tentatively scheduled for Friday
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
November 18th
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
so Karen thank you so much Mr chairman
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
so my question was simply
 
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
if we accept it where do the final
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
minutes hang where do we put them so
 
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:41.060 align:start position:0%
that the public can see them
 
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
so currently the
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
um committee does have a web page under
 
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
the general court website and that is
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
where the minutes have been posted in
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
the past uh certainly following up with
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
your committee researcher Miss Christina
 
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
Dyer would be the appropriate entity to
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
consult as custodian for those records
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
again just for clarity I'm with an
 
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency and only
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
providing this to be trying to be
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
helpful for you folks this morning thank
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
you you've been very helpful thank you
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh when we're done you could
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
run up to the fourth floor if you would
 
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
please when we're done the meeting yeah
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman
 
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
okay I'm willing to just withdraw those
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
and not cause a commotion
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
or we could skim them and accept them
 
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
into your choice
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
it's just a little summary of what was
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
said by myself
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
Senator gray
 
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:34.970 align:start position:0%
Senator gray
um

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
because I am representing Rochester and
 
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
I'm also on the city council of
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
Rochester and do lots of other things in
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh a lot of this is an
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
internal matter okay that
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh certainly the change from a
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
non-profit hospital to a profit Hospital
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh makes a lot of changes happen at that
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
hospital certainly right now the
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is reviewing whether or
 
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.210 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is reviewing whether or
not

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
um Rochester should do away with having
 
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:11.180 align:start position:0%
birthing services at the hospital
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
and refer their patients down to their
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
facility in Portsmouth or to other
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
places again
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that this needs to be in
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
our minutes uh there are people that are
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
out there looking at it I certainly my
 
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
family has been affected by the changes
 
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
there uh that my wife followed uh her
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner to a different
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
practice uh because she was very
 
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that that person
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know this is working its way
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
out that you know changes are to be
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
expected when you go from a non-profit
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
hospital to a profit hospital and these
 
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
are some of the things that are
 
00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
happening at that that point the new
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
chief executive at frisbee I believe is
 
00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
trying to work all of that out and I
 
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
think that he needs a little time to do
 
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.990 align:start position:0%
think that he needs a little time to do
that

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson would you wish
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
then that this is just for committee
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
interest only and not to be part of the
 
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
minutes that are for public consumption
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
my only concern is since I'm going to
 
00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
bring this up at the end since then I
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
have finally got a hold of or was able
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
to get a hold of me is the chief
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
executive officer there I just spoke to
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
him personally about two weeks ago and
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
he defends what they're doing at Frisbee
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
and did not see a problem he recognized
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
that there's a doctor shortage and my
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
question was why so many at one time and
 
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:47.339 align:start position:0%
it was very polite we had a nice
 
00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:48.949 align:start position:0%
it was very polite we had a nice
conversation

00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
is it your wish that this is just for
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
our eyes only and not to be part of the
 
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.170 align:start position:0%
our eyes only and not to be part of the
minutes

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
part not part of the minutes okay
 
00:13:58.569 --> 00:13:58.579 align:start position:0%
chair will accept that now the minutes
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
as handed out without this uh Amendment
 
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
or Edition anyone wish to move the
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
you already did yeah
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
I have short-term memory loss but thank
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
you second representative Solway all in
 
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.550 align:start position:0%
you second representative Solway all in
favor

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%

00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
aye opposed okay the minutes are
 
00:14:21.959 --> 00:14:23.569 align:start position:0%
aye opposed okay the minutes are
accepted

00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
an announcement lest I forget the next
 
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
meeting of this group will be November
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
18 it is usually the fourth Friday of
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
the month but that's Thanksgiving uh
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
weekend and we will all be recovering
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
from what is a tryptophan yeah we're
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
silly asleep so we're going to do it on
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
November 18th
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
that clashes with a finance oversight
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
meeting so when that happens we usually
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
meet at one so our next meeting will be
 
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
November 18 at 1 pm
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
the head Lori of many lorries
 
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
Services is like a British truck Park
 
00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
and the proud owner of a Winnebago say a
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
little bit about where you're going for
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
the next year please oh well thank you
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
um so most of you know that I am
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
stepping down as commissioner on
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
December 16th and plan to
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
travel and take a year off in 2023 and
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
bought myself a Winnebago that I test
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
did a test trip last weekend with and it
 
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
went really well so I will be in Florida
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
for six weeks in January and then Nova
 
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
Scotia for a couple months to see my
 
00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.019 align:start position:0%
family in the summer
 
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
so it'll be the first time I've seen my
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
family in three years since I became
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
commissioner so I'm very much looking
 
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:54.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for your report but you may
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
add to it anything you wish okay perfect
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
the Department's been very busy over the
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
last several months as most of you have
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
seen we are seeing an uptick in covid
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
and not just covet but other respiratory
 
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
illnesses and the fear is that we will
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
see not only an uptick in covet but then
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
a Resurgence of flu and other
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
respiratory virus so we are meeting with
 
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:29.300 align:start position:0%
the hospitals as recently as yesterday
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
to plan for any type of uptick in
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
respiratory viruses in the coming
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
respiratory season which is typically
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations are also ticking up as
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
compared to three months ago but still
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
manageable at this point
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
we have a new Telehealth contract that's
 
00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:53.579 align:start position:0%
going to govern our Council next
 
00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and that is a Telehealth
 
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
program that allows for direct access to
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
Providers to prescribe paxilovid which
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
is the antiviral we've heard throughout
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
the last several months that both some
 
00:17:11.409 --> 00:17:11.419 align:start position:0%
providers are hesitant to prescribe it
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
some patients are unable to get an
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
appointment within the first 72 hours
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
what's its name again please Pax lovid
 
00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
so many patients were unable to get an
 
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
appointment within the first 72 hours
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
which is uh the time frame in which you
 
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
have to start the treatment so it's very
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
similar to some of the other New England
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
states we were setting up with a
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
provider to have a dedicated Telehealth
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
line to get prescriptions for pecslovid
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that contract will be going to
 
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
Governor Council on Wednesday and we're
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
very hopeful that that will help with
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
reducing negative outcomes and severe
 
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
illness in covid
 
00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:57.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
new mental health program we started in
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
July called CTI or also critical time
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
intervention it is an evidence-based
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
High Fidelity program that follows
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
mental health patients after discharge
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
from the hospital for nine months in
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
other states when this program was
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
implemented we they saw about a 20
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
reduction in readmissions
 
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:24.260 align:start position:0%
so we started Statewide July 1 we have
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
182 participants in it which is
 
00:18:29.049 --> 00:18:29.059 align:start position:0%
extremely good
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
already seeing some early data showing
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
early success in the program so very
 
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
very optimistic about that really making
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
a huge difference when it comes to ER
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
boarding and and mental mental health
 
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:49.820 align:start position:0%
patients getting care in their community
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
watching our census rise now from about
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
44 up to in the 60s at this point
 
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
Staffing up everything is going really
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
really well there obviously anytime you
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
transition from a family-owned business
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
to a corporate structure or state
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
government structure there is growing
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
pains and there is transition time and
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
we're getting through that
 
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
could you just restate that second
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
number you said up from 44 and now it's
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
what in the 60s in the 60s
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
so making it through the transition time
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
for staff some of the staff came to
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
State Employment some of the staff went
 
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
to the well path contract we are in the
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
midst of doing the RFP for the next
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
round of contracts for services at that
 
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.570 align:start position:0%
round of contracts for services at that
hospital

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
so we will we expect to be releasing
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
that RFP in the coming the coming weeks
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
and then we start the renovations for
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
the closed unit to become a prtf or a
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
facility for youths we have no prtfs in
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
the state it has been a very clear Gap
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
in our system
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we're very excited we're expecting
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
right around maybe a little more than 12
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
youth that need long-term psychiatric
 
00:20:20.409 --> 00:20:20.419 align:start position:0%
residential treatment
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
to be to be in this facility once it
 
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
opens which we're hoping to be later
 
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
late first quarter release second
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2023.
 
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
that is my update but I'm happy to take
 
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.289 align:start position:0%
that is my update but I'm happy to take
questions

00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
questions

um what what is the prft what's what are
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
ptrflexia it's nothing to laugh
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
psychiatric Residential Treatment
 
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.909 align:start position:0%
psychiatric Residential Treatment

00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
Facility
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then uh Mr chair yes I have a late
 
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
uh the Army would call it an alibi on
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
the minutes uh Senator Rosenwald was
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
good enough to correct the let's let the
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner finish up and then we'll
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
we'll do that okay well it's a related
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
subject I just want to I just want to
 
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
change be able to change in the final
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
minutes uh my reference to Hampstead
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
Residential Treatment Facility to
 
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
psychiatric treatment resident facility
 
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:30.980 align:start position:0%
so that the minutes match the reality
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
and any objections to that one change to
 
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
the minutes saying none okay it's so
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
changed thank you thank you and I I I
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
had another question but no go ahead
 
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.950 align:start position:0%
had another question but no go ahead
okay

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.850 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
so so uh Madam commissioner um we have
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
an increase in respiratory diseases and
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
an uptick in covid
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
um do you anticipate uh at this point
 
00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
that there should be any changes made in
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh the absentee ballot procedures uh
 
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
such as their what were in 2020 under
 
00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:09.299 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders or or or have you
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
thought about whether this should have
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
affect any election issues election rule
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
does not fall under the purview of DHHS
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank God yeah but do you have a would
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
you have a recommendation for the
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State I haven't even
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
thought about it and the secretary's
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state has not reached out
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
to me so as of right now I I don't
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
believe that there is
 
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.649 align:start position:0%
believe that there is
um

00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
um in any uh any desire for DHHS to
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
weigh in on the upcoming election I
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
would say that although there is an
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
uptick in covid and other respiratory
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
illness it's not anywhere near it was in
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have two questions
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
if I could yes thank you good morning
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner good morning
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
um first on the Medicaid dental contract
 
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
do you expect to be on next week's
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
um governor and Council as
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
with with a contract yes okay so it will
 
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
be on Wednesday's agenda and has have
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
been released yet do we know who the
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
event it is usually released uh either
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
Friday or Monday so it might be released
 
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
later this afternoon thank you so that
 
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
it that is next week my second question
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
is over the past year or so the F
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal committee we have
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
accepted or appropriated 30 million
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
dollars in total for two freestanding
 
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Hospital units I understand
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
one one of those projects has stalled
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I guess is still stalled
 
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.370 align:start position:0%
and I guess is still stalled
but

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
um we've gotten conflicting information
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
on how many additional adult beds
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
will be provided by the other project
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
and I have not gotten a response to my
 
00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.010 align:start position:0%
and I have not gotten a response to my
emails

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
emails
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
from that second hospital system for
 
00:24:23.159 --> 00:24:24.289 align:start position:0%
from that second hospital system for
nearly

00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
nearly
 
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
six weeks my emails are going ignored
 
00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:33.559 align:start position:0%
um how many additional
 
00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299 align:start position:0%
voluntary and involuntary Adult
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric beds are we getting for that
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars we have appropriated
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
that the the contract for that hospital
 
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
is still in negotiations so we expect it
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
to be for the next several weeks
 
00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.419 align:start position:0%
uh they're
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is that the net
 
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419 align:start position:0%
increase in beds
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
not adult but net increase in general is
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
going to be about 60. I don't have a
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
final number yet but it's around that
 
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.490 align:start position:0%
final number yet but it's around that
number

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we wrote into
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
that contract
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
is that on agreement from both parties
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
the use of those beds can change so if
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
they stand up let's say 12 kids beds or
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
20 gero psychiatric beds and the market
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't there's no need for it in the
 
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:36.260 align:start position:0%
community then
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
upon mutual agreement we can convert
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
those to adult beds same as if we if we
 
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
stand up dozens of additional adult beds
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
and and because of our community
 
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
programs that we've started other drf
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
openings if there is not the need in the
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
community for adult beds we can convert
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
those to to Children's beds so the the
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
numbers that we end up with when we move
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
the contract forward by the time the
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
building is built there they could
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
change and we want them to be able to
 
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
change because the the vendor is signing
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
a 10-year agreement and the need today
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
is going to be different than the need
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
two years from now and certainly
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
different than the 10 years from now so
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
when we when we bring the contract
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
forward we will have a number at that
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
point on how many adult specific beds
 
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
about both voluntary and involuntary
 
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.690 align:start position:0%
about both voluntary and involuntary
but

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
that is flexible and I don't I don't
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
have that number here with me right now
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
one phone one follow-up yes thank you so
 
00:26:48.659 --> 00:26:49.490 align:start position:0%
one phone one follow-up yes thank you so
when

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
when you refer to the vendor are you
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the hospital
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh vendor or are you talking about a
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
private for profit vendor our agreement
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
is going to be with solution health so
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
um the the grant agreed agreement itself
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
is between the state of New Hampshire
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
and solution Health there is components
 
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
of the contract that allow them to
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
assign out some of the responsibilities
 
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
to a third party and my understanding is
 
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
that the plan is for them to partner
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
with and with another entity to stand
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
this Hospital up but our grant agreement
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question for the
 
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.269 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question for the
commissioner

00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative Solway uh good morning
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner good morning to you a
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
comment for the committee
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
um and for the public
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
as you talk about our attempts to limit
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
the spread of communicable disease I'd
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
like to point out that we have a
 
00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:04.460 align:start position:0%
quadruple whammy headed our way
 
00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:10.220 align:start position:0%
uh covid Spike appears to be upon us and
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
rates of immunization with booster
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
internationally is going very very
 
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.730 align:start position:0%
internationally is going very very
slowly

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:18.740 align:start position:0%
slowly
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
but and we have a drug that you've
 
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
already mentioned Pax lovid however
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
practitioners are reluctant to use it
 
00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
because there appear to be significant
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh rebound effects
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
secondly we have an unusual event and
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
that is a spike in RSV respiratory
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
syncular virus normally this is
 
00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:44.299 align:start position:0%
considered to be a pediatric disease
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
however in the last two and a half years
 
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
because kids have been sequestered
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
because of covid they haven't been
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
exposed and what we are finding is that
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
RSV RSV infection which we always
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
consider to be pediatric are now going
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
up in the age spectrum and we are
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
finding older kids and young adults who
 
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
are coming down with RSV thirdly we do
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
have an influenza headed our way we have
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
immunization for it but we don't know
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
from year to year how effective that
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
immunization is in my long tenure as an
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist I have seen it at 90
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
percent I have seen it at four percent
 
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
finally the last piece of good news is
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
that we will have a normal rhinovirus
 
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
season uh cold season so we can
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the state could very
 
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
well be hit with a four part
 
00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
epidemic of upper respiratory infection
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
and our only
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
hope is that with adequate preventions
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
we can limit that do we have a program
 
00:30:05.769 --> 00:30:05.779 align:start position:0%
out there for distancing hand washing
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
masking and immunizations we've got to
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
alert our public so we have worked very
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
hard on trying to get the message out
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
about getting a booster uh this fall
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
season this is this is the time it's the
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
same time we get our annual flu
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
vaccination to protect us during those
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
High months November through March so we
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
have mobile Vans out now doing
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics and we also have the
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
Homebound Program to vaccinate anybody
 
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:39.740 align:start position:0%
that's in the home
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
obviously the flu the flu vaccinations
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
are uh are in the same spots they've
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
always been in I think part of what what
 
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.059 align:start position:0%
is happening we've had a really good six
 
00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:52.430 align:start position:0%
is happening we've had a really good six
months

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
with infections rates have been down
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations have been down and
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
there's almost a sense of complacency
 
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
and as rates start to go up people start
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
to know other people that got coveted
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
again or they've been hospitalized I
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
think you will naturally see some of the
 
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
the booster the new booster pick up
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
the other New England states are seeing
 
00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
a much higher rate of the the
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
um illnesses that you that you mentioned
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
currently right now New Hampshire is not
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
seeing it as much but the uh the Boston
 
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
New York areas are Dr Ballard Dr Chan Dr
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
Ballard met with all the CMOS from the
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals yesterday and they are
 
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.210 align:start position:0%
hospitals yesterday and they are
preparing

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
preparing
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
um in that they're ordering uh the PPE
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
that is required the papers all of those
 
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.049 align:start position:0%
that is required the papers all of those
things

00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
um so everything is available and I feel
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
like the state has prepared our Hospital
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
systems are prepared
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
it but it is up to the general public to
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
start taking advantage of the programs
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
that we have set up to do this
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
a very very difficult time in in your
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%

any other questions for the commissioner
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
other than if New England's going to get
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
hit so badly how many can your Winnebago
 
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
accommodate we all want to go south yeah
 
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
I've retrofitted it to to fit six dogs
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure that I can fit any more
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
people that's a good answer and thank

you so much it's been a joy to work with
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
you over the last few years it's been
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
we've had give and take but it's always
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
been with the state of New Hampshire in
 
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
mind and it's been done right so thank
 
00:33:11.169 --> 00:33:11.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
18 November she could still come back
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.889 --> 00:33:23.899 align:start position:0%
on the agenda is a report
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
on the transparency issues with the New
 
00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:31.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Medicine as you know
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
through various articles
 
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:37.640 align:start position:0%
we've come to
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
wonder if the rate or the level of
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
transparency in reporting by the Board
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
of Medicine is worthy of some
 
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.909 align:start position:0%
of Medicine is worthy of some
improvement

00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
this committee a month ago approved a
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which I named it's met
 
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
twice different individuals in ones twos
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
and threes have met and
 
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative soloway has put together
 
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
a report it was sent out by me to the
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
Boston Globe the union later in Channel
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
9 yesterday so they could be on top of
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
it it is a working document
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
and we sent it out to you last night we
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
have copies of it here for you if you
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
would go through it
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh does everyone have a copy of
 
00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:34.460 align:start position:0%
Representative solway's report
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
unless I'm just misfied
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
would you make sure we all have a copy
 
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
please we have hard copies here at the
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
end of the table and email copies were
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
uh set
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
and okay if the clerk would pass out
 
00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:52.700 align:start position:0%
what's at the end of the table
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's entitled report to the oversight
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
committee on the Department of Health
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
and Human Services it looks like this
 
00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
and our job as oversight is to look at
 
00:35:04.859 --> 00:35:05.950 align:start position:0%
and our job as oversight is to look at
this

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
make suggestions
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
and on Monday
 
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.609 align:start position:0%
and on Monday
the

00:35:12.609 --> 00:35:12.619 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will meet again
 
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
to polish this up
 
00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:20.339 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
our inputs
 
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
if you get home and read it over again
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
more thoroughly and have more input
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
please send that to representative
 
00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.950 align:start position:0%
please send that to representative
soloway

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
soloway
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
over the weekend Monday afternoon we
 
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
will look at this once again
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
it will come back to this meeting of
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
oversight in our November meeting
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
November 18th
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
it I doubt unless you know you people
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
just really want to I doubt that either
 
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
this committee or the subcommittee will
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
in its own names craft legislation
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
my guess is that different individuals
 
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
from both groups will come together with
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
an LSR
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
um so be thinking in terms of the report
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
but where we're going to go with it
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
so let's take a few minutes and and look
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
foreign there should be a period at the
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
end of Page Three there is no page four
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
so if you wondered where it went
 
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
um by means of appropriate media it's
 
00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
findings it should be a period and that
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
I know a few of you have called me and
 
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.510 align:start position:0%
I know a few of you have called me and
uh

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
you've had some questions and I told you
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
to bring them to this meeting take them
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
to this meeting and here we are
 
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
chair and uh this is uh for
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative salawar I think
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
um one I I think this is an outstanding
 
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
work thank you for everything you've
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
done on it you've shown really great
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
leadership I I just uh I I just would
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
like to see if I can summarize
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
what this report basically has done for
 
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
the public and to make sure I understand
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
what what we've done I I think what
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've done is we looked into the the
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
board of medicines reporting and one of
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest issues I think we discovered
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
was that the Board of Medicine in all
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
cases does not receive the kind of
 
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:39.740 align:start position:0%
notices that it might and so the first
 
00:40:44.089 --> 00:40:44.099 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh or or two really is
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
about making sure that we're we're
 
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.050 align:start position:0%
about making sure that we're we're
getting

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
um as a sufficient or an adequate or
 
00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:53.579 align:start position:0%
appropriate whatever the word is amount
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
of visibility into what's happening
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
around the state and have it reported to
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine they they don't
 
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
know what they don't know and so we're
 
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
trying to fix that to me that's like 50
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
of this report it's a big thing then
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
then from there it seems to me like what
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
we've done is that we've we've
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
essentially just said you know let's
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that the process is for
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
investigation are okay let's make sure
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
that we're clear that the Board of
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
Medicine their reporting requirements
 
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
are are appropriate and then because we
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate with the additional reporting
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
that there may be a growth in workload
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
we're going back to the Board of
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
Medicine and oplc to say
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
you you may need to take a look at the
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
coming workload and and use the the
 
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:44.339 align:start position:0%
budget process to request additional
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
resources should they be required is
 
00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
that is that a fair representation of of
 
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
what we of the basic inherent structure
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
of of this subcommittee report extremely
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
well said representative Edwards I
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
believe even the Corporal standing
 
00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:03.140 align:start position:0%
outside the tent would have understood
 
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh from what went on in our
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
deliberations exactly what we intended
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
to do and I think that uh We've with uh
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
what I can only describe as an
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
outstanding uh subcommittee working on
 
00:42:19.849 --> 00:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
this this is certainly not uh entirely
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
my work by any means
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
we've been able to identify some of the
 
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
obstacles in the process of reporting
 
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
and we've indicated as you have pointed
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
out the necessity to provide the Board
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
of Medicine with adequate resources to
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
deal with an increased and improved flow
 
00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:45.380 align:start position:0%
of information to investigate
 
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
appropriately and therefore using their
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
professional discretion to act
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
accordingly in the public interest and
 
00:42:58.809 --> 00:42:58.819 align:start position:0%
finally sir to make known to the public
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
the results of their investigations and
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
their actions and that last part is
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical to their
 
00:43:13.609 --> 00:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.619 --> 00:43:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
I have a question when I looked on the
 
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine website I believe I
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
read that complaints should be directed
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
to oplc so this question has two parts
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
number one did I read it correctly and
 
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
number two I am assuming then that we
 
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
are changing that by this document
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
should it be accepted
 
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
I think that's a wonderful
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation Mr chairman uh that did
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
not come to the attention of the
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
committee I'm glad that you've brought
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
it up and certainly we can make that
 
00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.829 align:start position:0%
it up and certainly we can make that
recommendation

00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:54.500 align:start position:0%
oplc is the office of Professional
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
Licensing and certification
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
and currently a committee is at work
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
coming out of Senate Bill 330 which
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
looks at the interface between oplc and
 
00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
the 50 some odd boards that it works
 
00:44:11.819 --> 00:44:12.950 align:start position:0%
the 50 some odd boards that it works
with

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
there has been some question as to
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
what oplc's actual role is it is it
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
secretarial service is there oversight
 
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
do they take some of the work from some
 
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
of the boards that will be determined
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
but we will need to make sure as this
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
document gets polished up
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
first of all I think that it is really
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
our intent that the Board of Medicine
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
will do the investigating work and not
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
oplc and secondly that perhaps we could
 
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
state that as a specifically as a change
 
00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:50.180 align:start position:0%
that is being made
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
any other yes Senator Rosenwald
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
representative solo hay for your work on
 
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:01.609 align:start position:0%
representative solo hay for your work on
this

00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:02.809 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
I I've read this report
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
two or three times
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
um and I'm trying to
 
00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:14.900 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
with knowing that the special regard is
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
for the issue of transparency that was
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
the focus and so given that
 
00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:27.980 align:start position:0%
the mission of the
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine is to really to
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
protect public health and safety and
 
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.290 align:start position:0%
protect public health and safety and
we're

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
wondering how to increase transparency
 
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
the only thing I questioned in here is
 
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
on page three in the investigation
 
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.589 align:start position:0%
on page three in the investigation
section

00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
um you said wherever possible and
 
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.630 align:start position:0%
um you said wherever possible and
practical

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
practical
 
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
investigating committee shall include
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
citizens attorneys and clergy and I'm
 
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.550 align:start position:0%
citizens attorneys and clergy and I'm
wondering

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
um why why clergy and not Medical
 
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.109 align:start position:0%
um why why clergy and not Medical
ethicists

00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
ethicists
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
since part of the mission of the board
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
is to make sure Physicians are
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
practicing safely
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
and ethically why
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee
 
00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:23.420 align:start position:0%
made that
 
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
determination not to go with it with an
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
ethicist if there were investigations
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
involving ethical practice
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question Senator
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your wisdom on that
 
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:39.530 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your wisdom on that
um

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
the term clergy was used
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
I think out of respect for a substantial
 
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
number of clergy present in the state as
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to the number of medical
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
ethicists that are available within the
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
state and the hope that our clergy would
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
likewise be Adept at ethics however I
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
think that the term medical ethicus it
 
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
would be a boon a
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
a very positive in addition to the
 
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
operation of the Board of Medicine if we
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
can find them
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
let me respond to that in that this past
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
Monday we constituted the I don't have
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
the title correct even though I'm the
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
chairman of it
 
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:25.670 align:start position:0%
chairman of it
um

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
a committee of ethicists to advise DHHS
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
this came out of Bill 1045 House Bill
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
1045 and we brought together a variety
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
of ethicists from numbers of disciplines
 
00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:46.339 align:start position:0%
including a professor of Ethics the
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
ethicist go-to person from the
 
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association we have a
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
go-to person when lawyers want to talk
 
00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
about ethics they go to this person we
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
skim the cream so I can find some
 
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
ethicists if I'm asked to
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
the second reason I didn't put the word
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
clergy in here I was quite surprised
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
when I saw this and I wondered why
 
00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.010 align:start position:0%
when I saw this and I wondered why
um

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
most clergy at least perished clergy
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
are in the hospital a lot visiting sick
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
parishioners so clergy probably see a
 
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
lot of medical care
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
good bad and indifferent and I remember
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
my student as a hospital chaplain
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
full-time when I actually went to the
 
00:48:33.359 --> 00:48:34.069 align:start position:0%
full-time when I actually went to the
um

00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
executive director of the particular
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
hospital and said look I'm not filing a
 
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
formal complaint I am strongly
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
suggesting you look at a particular
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
thing that I've now observed with one
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
person on three occasions and I don't
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
know what they did with it but I saw
 
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:51.380 align:start position:0%
that because I was there so uh certainly
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
I would say a member or two of the
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
clergy in fact we have one who has a
 
00:48:59.569 --> 00:48:59.579 align:start position:0%
master's degree in ethics and she is my
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
vice chair uh um Democrat legislator
 
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:05.300 align:start position:0%
from Exeter so I would want to keep
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
clergy in the sentence as long as you
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
don't pick me
 
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
but certainly add ethicists
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
to the list absolutely
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh reply Mr chairman reply uh Senator
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
picking up on uh the remarks earlier by
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh what you see
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
in that paragraph is our attempt to make
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine more inclusive for
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
the public interest
 
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:41.180 align:start position:0%
and by specifying
 
00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:44.339 align:start position:0%
non-physician members in investigation
 
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
that was our hope I think the addition
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
of the medical ethicists makes very good
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
chairman I would I'm glad that Senator
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald brought up that issue because
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
I I looked at that same sentence with a
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
certain amount of um uh questioning and
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
and in part I think it it is probably
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate but perhaps not in that
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
paragraph because at the beginning of
 
00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
that paragraph you're still referring to
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
the internal review Committees of
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
organizations such as Hospital group
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
practices Etc and as such those internal
 
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
reviews are oftentimes protected under
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
quality assurance such as m m quality
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
assurance meetings and stuff like that
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
so it may not be the most appropriate
 
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
place to have not non-clinical folks
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
involved but I believe that the Board of
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
Medicine in their review of any
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
complaints or issues do have
 
00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:44.660 align:start position:0%
non-clinical people
 
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
from various professions sitting in
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
their board reviews so again I think we
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
have to iron that out but
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
my sense is that when you're referring
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
to internal view committees we're
 
00:50:56.809 --> 00:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
talking specifically about committees
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
that are part of Health Care
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
organizations and much of that
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
information is in a sense not
 
00:51:05.809 --> 00:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
discoverable so I'm not sure its
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
position there is necessarily where we
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
want it though it does come into play in
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine inquiry so it's
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
probably one of those things we need to
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
discuss when we meet again on Monday
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative put an arrow
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
moved it down and we can discuss that on
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
Monday thank you for your continuing
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
input this year I would appreciate it if
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
you would find out exactly what
 
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
non-medical people are on that board to
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
see which board are you referring to now
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
the internal we were referring to
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
internal Committees of organizations
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
which oftentimes are where much of this
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
information is gathered in
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
it to my mind
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
the there are two major issues that we
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
were charged with one is to get that
 
00:51:53.329 --> 00:51:53.339 align:start position:0%
information from those organizations
 
00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
whether it's a solo practice a group
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
practice a hospital a nursing home
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
wherever how do we get that information
 
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine number two is
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
the issue of transparency and what is
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
released but I will try to find out
 
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:08.220 align:start position:0%
specifically but in many of the
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
organizations I've been part of those
 
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
internal reviews do not necessarily
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
include a large swath of non-clinical
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
folks for for various reasons but and
 
00:52:22.329 --> 00:52:22.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
once again you did a wonderful job
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
to those in the audience who wish to
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
weigh in over the weekend
 
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
um talk to him
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
I I I'd like to make a motion when
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
you're ready uh when I'm ready okay
 
00:52:50.089 --> 00:52:50.099 align:start position:0%
also we are inviting to the party on
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon
 
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh those from the hospital Association
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
um doctors Association the various
 
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.049 align:start position:0%
um doctors Association the various
stakeholders

00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:53:05.569 --> 00:53:05.579 align:start position:0%
we would like you there
 
00:53:05.579 --> 00:53:06.530 align:start position:0%
we would like you there
um

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
if you haven't received this report I
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
would like to get it to you let me know
 
00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:13.940 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure you get it because
 
00:53:17.089 --> 00:53:17.099 align:start position:0%
Monday will probably be the last real
 
00:53:17.099 --> 00:53:18.290 align:start position:0%
Monday will probably be the last real
big

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
work on this
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
so you're all invited and I'll make sure
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
emails go out representative Edwards uh
 
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair because I think we
 
00:53:31.849 --> 00:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
have consensus that the investigations
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
paragraph may need to be tweaked a
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
little bit what what I'd like to
 
00:53:40.089 --> 00:53:40.099 align:start position:0%
recommend or make a motion is that the
 
00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:45.059 align:start position:0%
HHS oversight except this as a draft
 
00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
um so that we can read it into the
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
included in our minutes and that when we
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
finish the work on Monday then then well
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
the next one will be the final so to
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
clean up my motion uh I move that we
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
accept uh representative saloway's
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
report uh as a draft uh
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
for now I I will second that with the
 
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.130 align:start position:0%
for now I I will second that with the
light

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
light
 
00:54:13.329 --> 00:54:13.339 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
next item on the agenda is the other sub
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
committee that was appointed the task
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
force on Precision medicine and bio
 
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.190 align:start position:0%
force on Precision medicine and bio
marking

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
marking

Precision medicine was impaneled to deal
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
with an initiative uh brought
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
to the house uh the community on Health

her own
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:12.500 align:start position:0%
to make available

on a larger scale to citizens of New
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the benefits of what is known
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
as Precision medicine this was an
 
00:55:22.079 --> 00:55:23.710 align:start position:0%
as Precision medicine this was an

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
well-intended and generous effort on her
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
part and as a result this was remanded
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
to the oversight committee where
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson uh constituted this
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
task force on Precision medicine and

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
to his credit he appointed several

representative Canon representative gay
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
and myself and we have worked hard on
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
that but I must say that as an interim
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
report the focus of that effort on
 
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
Precision medicine has changed markedly
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
as a result of the insights of
 
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
Representative Woods in particular and
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I'll try to be
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
more specific
 
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
both representative woods and
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant bring to the
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
task force of professional reputations
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
in regard to areas of the science of
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
medicine and they have pointed out that
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
while Precision medicine
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
is a very attractive concept it is not
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
yet a proven uh tactic
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
in dealing with disease it has not been
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
subject to clinical trials it has not
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
been subject to
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh case controlled studies and as a
 
00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
result we really don't know how
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
effective it is we had excellent
 
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
testimony that came to us from
 
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
um uh Medicaid from uh Ms Clifford who
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
runs uh the pharmacy section of our
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
State Medicaid office who pointed out
 
00:57:25.089 --> 00:57:25.099 align:start position:0%
that Precision medicine itself can be
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily expensive and the
 
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
funding burden to State Medicaid for a
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
very small number of cases could be
 
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
quite quite High quite high in in the
 
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
multiple Millions
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
um representative woods and
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant pointed out that
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
this discussion applies not only to
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
Precision medicine but it applies to
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies generally
 
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
and it was their recommendation and this
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
is in draft this is uh still under
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
discussion for a reason that I'll
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
explain in just a moment they suggested
 
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:08.180 align:start position:0%
that it would be more efficacious
 
00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
to craft a recommendation to the
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
oversight committee for the creation of
 
00:58:17.049 --> 00:58:17.059 align:start position:0%
a task force on emerging medical
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
Technologies which would include within
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
its purview Precision medicine to be
 
00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
sure but all emerging medical
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
Technologies as well uh so that draft is
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
in process the reason it has not come to
 
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
you yet
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
is that uh at our meetings and there's
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
just a fruit note
 
00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:41.579 align:start position:0%
um our first meeting was held in the
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office Building on a Monday
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
morning and we learned that the heat had
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
not yet been turned on in the
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
legislative office building so as we sat
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
in committee the temperature in the room
 
00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:55.940 align:start position:0%
was 57 degrees
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
despite that chilling effect
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
um we met for an hour and a half and
 
00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339 align:start position:0%
were able to listen to testimony to
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
extensive testimony from representative
 
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
woods and representative Merchant that
 
00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
we focus the committee uh we then met at
 
00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
a later meeting uh a little over a week
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
ago and unfortunately we did not have a
 
00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
quorum which could approve a draft so
 
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to have a quorum this
 
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
Monday morning that we will have a draft
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
in place and we'll be able to report
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
that back to the oversight committee on
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%

as you've come up with it so I can run
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
it by the various appropriate
 
00:59:47.329 --> 00:59:47.339 align:start position:0%
authorities to make sure it's uh the way
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost it is important to
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
remember that consumers should not
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
compare the quality of care and safety
 
01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
of the facility spend a number or types
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
of events reported consumers needs to
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
look at all facts factors such as the
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
size of the facility the scope and
 
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
complexity of procedures as well as the
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
number of procedures and services
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
performed at the facilities the
 
01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:42.299 align:start position:0%
population is forever changing with
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
higher Acuity in care com and
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
complexities in care some patients are
 
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
requiring more time in the hospitals the
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
covet pandemic also presented new
 
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.089 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm on page three there were if there
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
is a graph on the New Hampshire
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
seriously reported reportable events
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
from 2010 to 2021
 
01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
um just kind of shows you
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
our Trends
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
um for 2021 we have a total of 90
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events reported and which is a
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
decrease from 2020 which is shown in
 
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
that graph
 
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
um the areas that continues to be
 
01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.210 align:start position:0%
um the areas that continues to be
um

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:25.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
frequently reported Adverse Events are
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
in page five
 
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.329 align:start position:0%
in page five
um

01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:32.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
which are
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
surgical events
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
um stage three stage four and then
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
stageable pressure injuries and Falls so
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
there are about 34 Adverse Events
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
related to pressure injuries switches
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually in Page Six
 
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
um 27 related to Falls which is on page
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
seven and then a total of 17 adverse
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
event reports related to surgical vets
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
which is on page eight considering that
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
these event types represents about 87
 
01:04:03.049 --> 01:04:03.059 align:start position:0%
percent of the total adverse event
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
reported it is important that we
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
continue to focus our efforts on these
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
and address what the facilities are
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
doing in these areas to improve we did
 
01:04:14.569 --> 01:04:14.579 align:start position:0%
list down some strategies for pressures
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
false and surgical events just utilized
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
by these facilities such as for pressure
 
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
injuries would be developing proactive
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
approach in skin management from
 
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
admission ongoing assessments and
 
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
monitoring of high risk skin breakdown
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
areas all floating treatments and
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
devices involvement of interdisciplinary
 
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
teams such as the nursing team providers
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
wound care team dietitians and
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
standardized communication between
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary teams
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
um for fall such as early identification
 
01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
of high Forest patients and ongoing
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring assessments to ensure
 
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
appropriate fault prevention
 
01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:54.299 align:start position:0%
interventions are placed educating staff
 
01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
and patients of thought prevention
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
measures or intervention and its
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
importance and standardized
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
documentation and communication between
 
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary plenary teams for the
 
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
surgical events
 
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
such as like team building strategies to
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
promote just culture and expectation of
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
speaking up and problem identification
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
by all surgical team members reinforcing
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
implementation of No Interruption zones
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
for a critical phase such as timeout
 
01:05:20.099 --> 01:05:22.130 align:start position:0%
for a critical phase such as timeout
process

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:22.910 align:start position:0%
process
um

01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the strategies that
 
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.049 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the strategies that
the

01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
facilities are using the bureau samples
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
over 10 of this Adverse Events the beer
 
01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:35.579 align:start position:0%
asks for and received specific
 
01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
performance data as a follow-up to their
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
corrective action plans and all facility
 
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
samples provided performance information
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
it was concluded that the hospitals
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
followed through with their corrective
 
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
action plans
 
01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much
 
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions I have a
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
question upon investigation of something
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
that a facility reported as an adverse
 
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.549 align:start position:0%
that a facility reported as an adverse
event

01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
event
 
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
I could see three possible responses
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
number one you make recommendations hey
 
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:09.260 align:start position:0%
it would be a good idea if you did this
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
secondly you give orders I.E here's a
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
mandated action plan but also free if
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
you've had a mandated action plan
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
and it didn't get put into practice
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
at what level are you punitive do you
 
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
refer to law enforcement or the Attorney
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
General's office or if they just plain
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
don't do what you've now told them to do
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
what do you do next
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so um thank you for the
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman um the answer is a
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more complicated because this
 
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
is our federal team our um CMS team so
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
we have state law and then we have
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations under state law
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
um we are able to if um and all of the
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
CMS certified facilities are deemed
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
licensed which means they have to comply
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
with the law and the rule so we can take
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
administrative action if we do give a
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
directed plan of Correction to a
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
facility and they're not following
 
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
through we have um we would work with
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
our regional office from the federal
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
team to notify them of their
 
01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
non-compliance and in sometimes they
 
01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
will assess fines depending on the
 
01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
severity of the non-compliance and the
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
implications to the health and safety of
 
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
the residents and or patients
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
this would be done by the regional
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
office and not by you yourself no
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
um it would actually
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
um in many cases come from both the
 
01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
state and from the federal CMS team okay
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
we work together with them we can't take
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
so the difference between these
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
facilities and other facilities that are
 
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
not CMS is we those those types of
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
administrative actions come directly
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
from me
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
um in the case of the CMS team we have
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
to work with our regional office out of
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
Boston and more often than not they're
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
the ones that are going to assess the
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
fines and send the letters from the
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
federal government copying us has it
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
risen to the level where they still are
 
01:08:15.849 --> 01:08:15.859 align:start position:0%
obdurate and their license is now lifted
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
I'm unaware of any situation in these
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
types of facilities where that's
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
happened and also we haven't had to do
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
that in any CMS certified facility that
 
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of but I can certainly go back
 
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
and see if historic I've been with the
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
department for five years and we haven't
 
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
had to do that but I can take a look
 
01:08:38.209 --> 01:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
back if you want to know historical if
 
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
we've ever had to do that I infer that
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
it could be done however oh yes thank
 
01:08:45.729 --> 01:08:45.739 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome any other questions
 
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative soloway Mr chairman of
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
field permit I actually have three
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
questions that I would like to ask and
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
they are soft lobs to our presenters
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
my friend Dr soloway for soft lobs
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
looking at the reportable events by
 
01:09:08.339 --> 01:09:09.410 align:start position:0%
looking at the reportable events by

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
would you like I'll give you the three
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions you can prepare would you like
 
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
to uh identify the role of case mix in
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
the number of reportable events that
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
occur okay case makes varies okay
 
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
secondly uh given the spikes that we've
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
had over the last three years would you
 
01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
just give us a word about the impact of
 
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
the overtaxed capacity on hospitals of
 
01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.249 align:start position:0%
the overtaxed capacity on hospitals of
covid

01:09:37.249 --> 01:09:37.259 align:start position:0%
covid
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
and thirdly and this question comes from
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
my wife who's not in
 
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
um would you like to comment on what
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
effect a shortage of our ends in the
 
01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
um for your last question about the
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
staff shortages
 
01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:05.470 align:start position:0%
staff shortages
um

01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
some of the reports does indicate
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
because they do like a comprehensive
 
01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
um root cause analysis and looking at
 
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
different types of factors contributing
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
factors that would lead to that event
 
01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.169 align:start position:0%
factors that would lead to that event
um

01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
staff competencies
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
um and kind of knowledge of facility
 
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
protocols they are
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of traveling nursing staff
 
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
that's you know
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
um in the kind of healthcare
 
01:10:47.229 --> 01:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
World hospitals you know everywhere so
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
that is one of the things that they've
 
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
that I've seen in the reports that I
 
01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.350 align:start position:0%
that I've seen in the reports that I
receive

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
receive
um

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
but not all some of the reports
 
01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.010 align:start position:0%
but not all some of the reports
um

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
there's really no I'm I was looking at
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
the reports and the amount of reports
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
that they've sent us there's really no
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
change they've been really consistent on
 
01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
reporting Adverse Events to our
 
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
reporting Adverse Events to our
department

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.610 align:start position:0%
department
um

01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
the only thing that they've reached out
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
to me is the time frame of and how
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
they're doing the root cause analysis is
 
01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
because of covet they're unable to like
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
meet up meet up as a group so they had
 
01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
to do virtuals they had to kind of work
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
things out virtually which made it a
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
little bit difficult for them to really
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
kind of do a more comprehensive like in
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
a timely manner but they're able to you
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
know at least
 
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:48.950 align:start position:0%
know at least
um

01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
do some corrective action plans
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
immediately and then kind of like on the
 
01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
overs overall oversight is kind of still
 
01:11:56.219 --> 01:11:58.669 align:start position:0%
overs overall oversight is kind of still
ongoing

01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
um could you elaborate on the case mix
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
please with with pleasure I thought
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
you'd never ask
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
as we look over the individual Hospital
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
data we see variability in a reportable
 
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.970 align:start position:0%
data we see variability in a reportable
events

01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
events
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
um in part this may be affected by the
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
mix of cases that get referred to
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals so in in fact if you wanted to
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
understand how uh efficiently hospitals
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
were dealing with uh potential
 
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
reportable events you would want to take
 
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:44.780 align:start position:0%
a look at the diagnoses and complexities
 
01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
of affecting patients that get referred
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
to them so some of our hospitals have
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
higher numbers of reportable events uh
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
because of this dual problem of
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
difficulty in Staffing I think your
 
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
comment about traveling nurses is very
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
well taken and you place that in the mix
 
01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.890 align:start position:0%
well taken and you place that in the mix
with

01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
um complex referrals and you have a
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
difficult situation facing a hospital
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
and that gets reflected in the number of
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
reportable events so I'm trying to take
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
some of the onus off of the hospitals
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
that have higher numbers that's a really
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
great point and I really appreciate you
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
making that point is that something we
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
look at now and if not we I don't know
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
that we do I mean looking at the reports
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
by the hospitals you can definitely see
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
where the highest
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
um frequently reports are and if you
 
01:13:46.729 --> 01:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
look into the hospitals it's really like
 
01:13:46.739 --> 01:13:47.930 align:start position:0%
look into the hospitals it's really like
Center

01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
Center
 
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire which like from like
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
some of them are Manchester conquered
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
because some of the hospitals are far
 
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
away and they get referred to like more
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
of a bigger hospitals than you see and
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
they take more
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
um complex patients
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
which are more sicker and so you kind of
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
see more higher numbers there because
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
they do have and you have to consider
 
01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:12.179 align:start position:0%
bats as well the services that they
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
provide so you'll definitely see higher
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
numbers on like hospitals that provide
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
more services and kind of higher complex
 
01:14:19.199 --> 01:14:21.010 align:start position:0%
more services and kind of higher complex
services

01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:21.020 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up is there something you
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
would like us to add to the report going
 
01:14:25.679 --> 01:14:26.689 align:start position:0%
would like us to add to the report going
forward

01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
um in regards to that
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
topic or is it something you just want
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
us to be considering as we're looking at
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
it do you want to see I'd just like you
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
to be considering it but I also uh
 
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
wanted the committee to understand the
 
01:14:42.169 --> 01:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
meaning of some of the data and I wanted
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
to thank you for significant efforts in
 
01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
sorting this out thank you very much you
 
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
know these are the times when I just
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
wish we had somebody from the hospital
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
Association here today why I recognize
 
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
Paula menahan from the hospital
 
01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:02.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
do you want us to move or
 
01:15:10.209 --> 01:15:10.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
well they're not going far
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson um for the
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
record column in the hand um Hospital

a business card could you give it to me
 
01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
I I would love to my assistant ordered
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
one after last month when I presented to

so certainly I appreciate the
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fill in a little bit more
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
um of the work that we have been doing
 
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
um as Lizette alluded to a lot of
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
challenges this year and the past couple
 
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
years related to covid
 
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
um in the beginning of covid we were
 
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
um changes in our fall raids and
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
pressure injury rates and that was
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
related to how we were caring for our
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
patients at that time uh since that time
 
01:16:28.689 --> 01:16:28.699 align:start position:0%
we've seen the effects of the Staffing
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
significantly as we mentioned with The
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
Travelers Not Just in nursing but we're
 
01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:35.460 align:start position:0%
having a lot of locums in terms of
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
providers so
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
um you know and anesthetists nurse
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
anesthetists anesthesiologists we've had
 
01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
a lot of turnover with our providers as
 
01:16:44.219 --> 01:16:45.410 align:start position:0%
a lot of turnover with our providers as
well

01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
um just a lot of people in different
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
areas are looking for new opportunities
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
and as these new providers and new
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
nurses and new other support staff are
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
coming in our orientation process change
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
during covid so a little bit less
 
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
Hands-On and a little bit more remote
 
01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.810 align:start position:0%
Hands-On and a little bit more remote
out

01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
introducing our new employees to our
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
culture and there's not necessarily an
 
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
investment in a Hospital's culture when
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
a provider or nurse is only there for a
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
limited amount of time and their
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
contract ends and there are no they know
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
that they're moving on to something else
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
so we've been working very hard in the
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
commission the quality Commission on how
 
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
we can improve those Communications
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
among our team members introduce those
 
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
new team members into our cultures and
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
how we do things it's been a challenge
 
01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:34.940 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Chris Herring is not able
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
to be here because she had a meeting
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
with our chief nursing officers in the
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
state but we are looking at some
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
resources by the ahr Q on implementing
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
team steps which is a process of
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
communication in healthcare settings how
 
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
can we enhance that in our current
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
settings where we don't necessarily have
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
the situation we had four or five years
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
ago where we had a solid group of people
 
01:18:01.679 --> 01:18:03.110 align:start position:0%
ago where we had a solid group of people
that

01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
stayed around so lots of work on that
 
01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you um I appreciate all of that I
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
I was my questions were actually for the
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
first panel okay I have a question for
 
01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.910 align:start position:0%
first panel okay I have a question for
anybody

01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:24.659 align:start position:0%
um on page three the uh the chart
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
serious reportable events 2017
 
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
58. the next year is 112 that's
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
pre-coveted so there was a huge jump and
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're seeing the numbers going down so
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the fact that floating
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
staff members mainly
 
01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:42.770 align:start position:0%
staff members mainly
foreign

01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
not quite be on board with what you're
 
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
doing to the degree your regulars are
 
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
I would have expected the big jump in
 
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
the last few years but I'm seeing it go
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
down and from your perspective and I'll
 
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
ask the previous two presenters why the
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
big jump from 2017 to 18. I believe that
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
I will look to uh my DHHS colleagues but
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
I think there was a change in um a
 
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
couple of the metrics
 
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
turn it off sorry you caught yourself
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
though that's good
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
um so over the years reporting coach I'm
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
working with the New Hampshire Hospital
 
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
Association has improved that culture of
 
01:19:38.209 --> 01:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
reporting and just awareness and kind of
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
continuing education with the staff of
 
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
reportables even with changes
 
01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:45.310 align:start position:0%
reportables even with changes
um

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
you can see that in the report that the
 
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
jump is
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
just because of the reporting culture
 
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
kind of working with the New Hampshire
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
and it's yeah so things haven't gotten
 
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
worse the reporting has just gotten more
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
precise correct good thank you now
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
they're back representative Edwards uh
 
01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I um I got a couple
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions in the summary section uh one
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
page no it's page nine
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh for I think this may be for Miss
 
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.450 align:start position:0%
uh for I think this may be for Miss
Shockley

01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
Shockley
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
um the the last paragraph talks about
 
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
your annual sample of 10 percent
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
and so that that kind of jumps out at me
 
01:20:31.209 --> 01:20:31.219 align:start position:0%
as potentially interesting information
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
on on how your actual audits what what
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
you find and I'm just curious do you do
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
you report that anywhere it's not in
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
this report it's actually a question for
 
01:20:50.689 --> 01:20:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
can do you want to look at the paragraph
 
01:20:57.130 --> 01:20:57.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.930 --> 01:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's really the selecting the 10 is
 
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.610 align:start position:0%
it's really the selecting the 10 is
random

01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
random
 
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
um so there's really we just just we do
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
quarterly I look at the numbers and then
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
just pick randomly
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
um the hospitals or Adverse Events and
 
01:21:15.169 --> 01:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
then reach out to the facilities and ask
 
01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
them for evidence of their craftive
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
action plans so the corrective action
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
plans that they provided within that 60
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
calendar days to be submitted like after
 
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.649 align:start position:0%
calendar days to be submitted like after
like

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:21:27.659 --> 01:21:28.250 align:start position:0%
like
um

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
because I look at the time frames that
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
they would put in for their corrective
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
action plans like how long they
 
01:21:36.649 --> 01:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
um expect that to be
 
01:21:36.659 --> 01:21:37.630 align:start position:0%
um expect that to be
um

01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
corrected so in the interest in time my
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
question isn't about your methodology my
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
question is on the extent it is a great
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
answer to a different question but my
 
01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
question really is
 
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
um do you have a separate report that
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
focuses on this 10 percent that you go
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
do an audit on because when you go do an
 
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
audit you find out are they doing it
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
right are they not doing it right I mean
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's why we do audits right I think
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
that's what Lizette is
 
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
um saying trying to say um but also
 
01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
giving more information so we are
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
looking at that and then doing
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
follow-ups to make sure that that 10
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
percent did do as they had said they
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
would do is that no I'm still asking
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
about how you report it to us that 10
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
the findings of the 10 that's not in
 
01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
this report
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
but the audit effort is distinct and I'm
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
just curious if you find anything
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
are you did you say you understood
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
because I don't understand I'm really
 
01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not understanding are you
 
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
asking us to put more information in
 
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
this report about the 10 like what we're
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
finding when we're doing the audit would
 
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
you like to see more information about
 
01:22:58.970 --> 01:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
those results I'm really sorry I
 
01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:02.219 align:start position:0%
personally would yeah because an audit
 
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
is uh and and kind of a verification
 
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
validation tool and I'd like to know are
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
we validating through these audits that
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
our reporters are doing the things that
 
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
they should be doing or these validation
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
efforts indicating that we're not really
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
complying well I I assume because it's
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
not in here that they're probably
 
01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
complying well and it may just be a
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
sentence or two correct and I think that
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
kind of goes hand in hand with what Mr
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
chairman asked earlier in terms of what
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
action do we take if they don't follow
 
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plan we would do a
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
directed plan of Correction and if that
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
isn't followed then we would take
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
administrative action with our regional
 
01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.050 align:start position:0%
administrative action with our regional
office

01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:23:53.209 --> 01:23:53.219 align:start position:0%
um but I we haven't had to do that
 
01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
because people are being compliant
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
um so I if I think that's what you're
 
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
asking so but we will um certainly going
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
forward if in fact there is
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
non-compliance after providing a
 
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan or a directed
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
plan of Correction then we would
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
certainly include that to let you know
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
going forward in the time that I've been
 
01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
here we haven't had to do that and I
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
don't know prior to the five years of my
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
being here
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah I I appreciate that and
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
that my assumption was that you were
 
01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
finding things to be fined you're in the
 
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
audits but I didn't want to make an
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
assumption when we had a report here so
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you for for sharing that the
 
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
next item I'd like to ask you about is
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
um the second paragraph of the summary
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
where it says on patreon facilities are
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
increasing their ability to identify
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
events last year when uh your
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
counterparts or maybe it was you I have
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
a bad memory but uh when when you all
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
came in I thought we had a very nice
 
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
conversation about the culture of
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
reporting and sort of the good faith uh
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
efforts that are necessary by our
 
01:25:10.810 --> 01:25:10.820 align:start position:0%
hospitals to self-report bad news
 
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
self-reporting bad news is a hard thing
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
and I think in your testimony last year
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
we we were kind of proud that we had
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
instilled that sort of reporting culture
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
and so so when I look at this paragraph
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
it says we are increasing their ability
 
01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
to identify events that would conflict
 
01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
with last year's testimony that we were
 
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
just great the reporting culture was in
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
place we were just great and so if we're
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
great are we increasingly great I I just
 
01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm nitpicking the selection of words
 
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
here because if if we don't get the
 
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
culture right on reporting then this
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
entire report becomes questionable and
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
and and and so the health of the
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
reporting culture is so important to
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
this whole process it's almost like it
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
should be its own paragraph how how are
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
we doing from managing and maintaining a
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
healthy reporting climate
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
that that's that's more common than
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
anything else but if you'd like to
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
respond please and I appreciate that and
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
and you're right um it is
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we weren't doing as well
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
as we stated last year which we were
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
doing that well I think what we really
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
work hard at and that's in collaboration
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
with you know the New Hampshire Hospital
 
01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.149 align:start position:0%
with you know the New Hampshire Hospital
Association

01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
um as well I mean I think we hear
 
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
regularly that in New Hampshire the
 
01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
relationships between the state
 
01:26:49.729 --> 01:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
regulatory body and the facilities that
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
are serving our residents is much
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
stronger than it is in other states and
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're really excited about that so I
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
think and and it's been a really rough
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
ride of recent times right and which
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
makes even reporting as you had
 
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier even more difficult
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
when you're running around you know
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
short staffed Etc et cetera so I think I
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
think our point there was just that
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
despite everything that's happening and
 
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
in our environment we are still really
 
01:27:20.209 --> 01:27:20.219 align:start position:0%
pleased with the collaborative effort
 
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
between our office and the community but
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
we will do better going forward at
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
articulating exactly what we mean
 
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
follow up so the reason I I think you
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
might want to go into a little bit more
 
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
depth is because the centrality of how
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
important this management of the culture
 
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
is and it and it's sort of good news so
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
I I would like to see everyone involved
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
in this take a little credit for doing
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
the hard thing which is self-reporting
 
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
and if we you know for example if we
 
01:27:57.649 --> 01:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
ended up having some hospitals open or
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
closed or change hands you know that can
 
01:28:04.729 --> 01:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
take a cultural hit on our overall State
 
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
situation and if if that were to cause a
 
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
cultural reporting problem it would be
 
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
good to make sure that we knew about it
 
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you Mr chairman
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
um just simple question the physical
 
01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
assault the one instance was at an
 
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
assault of a patient by a staff member
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
patient to staff
 
01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:49.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
Senator gray did a whole lot of work
 
01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:55.250 align:start position:0%
Senator gray did a whole lot of work
leading

01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
leading
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
a huge effort on Health Care workplace
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
violence and what we kept hearing was
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
that assaults of Staff by patients
 
01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
keep going up so I'm sort of surprised
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
to see only one instance
 
01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if you could elaborate on
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
why that is because if it's only one it
 
01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
something really good
 
01:29:28.370 --> 01:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
happened in that environment over the
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
past year
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
so for the the uh the Adverse Events
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
report then the guidance that we get is
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
from the national quantity forum and for
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
physical assaults
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
um the guidance are the definition is if
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
there's death or serious injuries
 
01:29:51.169 --> 01:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.179 --> 01:29:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
I think I'm I'm really processing this
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
because I I understand and I've been
 
01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
part of the many groups across working
 
01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
on that legislation we have to also
 
01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
remember that these are specific
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
um facility types but my thought would
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
be I mean first of all we're going to
 
01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
need to go back and look at some of the
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
information but if the definition is
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%
such that
 
01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
um in other cases where they're um where
 
01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
a staff member is injured it may not
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
have resulted in a serious injury or
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
death and in this case it did or the
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the facility is that
 
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
it did so it might be that we need to
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
take a look at that and I don't know if
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:44.540 align:start position:0%
Chris is here

01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
Healthcare quality and safety commission
 
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
and I was also part of uh work group
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
with Senator Sherman and Senator gray
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
when we were working on the workplace
 
01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:25.870 align:start position:0%
when we were working on the workplace
violence

01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislation so to lizette's point when
 
01:31:32.689 --> 01:31:32.699 align:start position:0%
you ask Senator Rosenwald why was there
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
only one event here it this was a
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
serious reportable event and that it
 
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
Rose to the definition of death or
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
Serious injury there are many more
 
01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
events outside of that definition that
 
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
occur in our organizations
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why there's only one
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this report and it's
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
because of the specificity of the
 
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.129 align:start position:0%
because of the specificity of the
definition

01:31:58.129 --> 01:31:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
if we keep that definition as one line
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
and then we have a much broader
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
definition as a second line
 
01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
because I want to know that I want to
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
know about assaults whether the person
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
assaulted loses work or life it's still
 
01:32:21.169 --> 01:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
to my mind a reportable thing
 
01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and I know in the workplace
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
violence commission legislation that
 
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
there is a definition of workplace
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
violence and of injury so that is going
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
to be clearly defined so that we will be
 
01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
able to report out and part of that
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
commission will be collecting statistics
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
from each of our hospitals that are
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
aligned with that definition so we will
 
01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
be able to give you that information has
 
01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
that bill been signed into law or is it
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
on the way correct which it's been
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
signed into it's been signed into law so
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's in the process of being implemented
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
correct so we're going to be beginning
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking process at
 
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you sir representative Edwards you
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
have a business card so I can get you
 
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
into the minutes properly and and then
 
01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
do you do you I don't I touched that
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill on the workplace violence and I
 
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
don't recall if the statistics end up in
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
your report or if they should they do
 
01:33:20.810 --> 01:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
not and I appreciate the um
 
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
follow-through on that because I wanted
 
01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
to mention that because of this
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
definition is what is required federally
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
to create this report which is partly
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
why the the new bill was signed into law
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
was to capture the population of
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
individuals that don't fall into this
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
very specific definition and that would
 
01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
be a different committee or a different
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
group that would be reporting those
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
numbers so we will not see those other
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
numbers in your report next year correct
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
unless you footnoted something from
 
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
another group
 
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
so we have it in one place okay we can
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
do that appreciate that
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair yes sir uh we did receive
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
another report over the last year that
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
did talk about workplace violence
 
01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.250 align:start position:0%
did talk about workplace violence
injuries

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:09.500 align:start position:0%
um or at least occurrences I should say
 
01:34:12.649 --> 01:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
so we may want Health and Human Services
 
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
to look at how they're reporting so that
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
we can make a decision you know if we
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
need to or they need to uh to
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
consolidate them in one place and not
 
01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
have them in two three places so and I
 
01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
can speak to that Senator gray I know
 
01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Hospital Association
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
has been asking hospitals to voluntarily
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
report for some years and I believe
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
that's that is what you're referencing
 
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
once we have the commission and the
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting delineated and that
 
01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
requirement in place will no longer have
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
the nhha requirement
 
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone
 
01:35:01.810 --> 01:35:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%

the to cut to the chase the ball has
 
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
started rolling and they have met with
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
the Manchester School Board in
 
01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.450 align:start position:0%
the Manchester School Board in
particular

01:35:34.450 --> 01:35:34.460 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
it's important to reiterate that
 
01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
families opt into the service I just
 
01:35:40.129 --> 01:35:40.139 align:start position:0%
want to say that early on at this
 
01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
question we have often gotten from this
 
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
committee and others families opt in but
 
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
amaskag has spent this fall since the
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
time they have received the contract
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
from dphs working with the Manchester
 
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
school board and the school board has
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
approved parental permission slips
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
they've approved the process flow of how
 
01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
information moves from their school
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
nurse to the medical providers at msgate
 
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
Health they have approved the
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
communication plans between the school
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the families and mscape health we
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
have approved we dphs have approved
 
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:17.699 align:start position:0%
these plans but also also have been very
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
impressed by the way in which amoske has
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
worked directly with the school board
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
and the school itself we feel like
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's where the decision making really
 
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
should be the community that is
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
operating this needed to be comfortable
 
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
with the process and so they have
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
indicated they are so so far amaskag to
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%

01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
on the agenda I'm happy to answer any
 
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:13.790 align:start position:0%
on the agenda I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
chair and Miss Tilly I I appreciate that
 
01:38:20.930 --> 01:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
you've been so transparent on this to
 
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
include you and me talking about this in
 
01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
your office like four months ago or
 
01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
whenever so it's it's great seeing the
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
progress that's being made and what um
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
my hang up is still and it sounds to me
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
like you've addressed it or it's been
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
addressed uh is the the parental consent
 
01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
issue you know I'm I'm I'm I want to
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
know more about that for example uh if
 
01:38:51.169 --> 01:38:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh the the family wants to opt in for
 
01:38:51.179 --> 01:38:52.570 align:start position:0%
uh the the family wants to opt in for
say

01:38:52.570 --> 01:38:52.580 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
some physical medical intervention
 
01:38:57.530 --> 01:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
should there be trauma or something on
 
01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
site you know I I could see filling out
 
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
a blanket form for that at the beginning
 
01:39:05.530 --> 01:39:05.540 align:start position:0%
of a school year but then
 
01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:07.390 align:start position:0%
of a school year but then
something

01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
such as a behavioral health counseling
 
01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if that gets covered under
 
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
that opt-in and I'm curious if the
 
01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
opt-in is per incident or or per school
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
year or per lifetime career the student
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
has with that school so there's still
 
01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
details that you may not have with you
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
today yeah yeah after a couple of those
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking right now at an
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
authorization for designation of
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
parental consent that's one of the forms
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
that they have there and they have check
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
boxes so physical examinations female
 
01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
examinations immunizations sick Care
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
Counseling Services health education so
 
01:39:49.129 --> 01:39:49.139 align:start position:0%
the parent can check off what it is that
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
they are opting into
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
and and there's a blanket for the school
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
year or is it a per incident I can um
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
without me just scanning these papers
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
right now I can get back to you on that
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you I would appreciate it if you
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
could uh get to the committee uh all the
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
forms that the parents would see I'd
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
like to see them too okay great we will
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
send that to the committee thank you
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
we'll send it to the chair and it'll be
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have a question that's a
 
01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
tad off topic to Hampshire College
 
01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
people vote for Williams or Amherst
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire college is not necessarily
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
known for their involvement in athletics
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%

01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
um I about a decade ago a little over a
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
decade ago
 
01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:12.980 align:start position:0%
legislation was approved that enabled
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS specifically uh Public Health uh to
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
begin a maternal mortality Review
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
Committee in conjunction with our
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
partners the Northern New England
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
perinatal quality improvement Network
 
01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
um and so that uh was really got going
 
01:42:40.330 --> 01:42:40.340 align:start position:0%
in 2012 and in 2019
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%

from the Centers for Disease Control uh
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%

01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
help support state maternal mortality
 
01:42:56.930 --> 01:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
review committees so it was competitive
 
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
we applied we got it this enabled us to
 
01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
um contractually uh or to contract with
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%

Network she is also the abstractor as
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
noted in the report so we have two
 
01:43:44.890 --> 01:43:44.900 align:start position:0%
abstractors one is my perinatal
 
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
coordinator at the Maternal Child Health
 
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
within HHS and the other is our
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
colleague at Napkin
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
Vicky okay thank you so much for
 
01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
allowing me to participate in this
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
review I was involved in this work ever
 
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
since the Inception of it so Trish Tilly
 
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
and I have been working on this for a
 
01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:08.219 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:44:10.129 --> 01:44:10.139 align:start position:0%
um what I'd like to share with you is
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
really the process that we go through it
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
which begins as a description on page
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
six and seven so
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
um what happens is that there are
 
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
several ways that patients that women
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
are identified who had died either
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
during pregnancy or within a year so
 
01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
they could have been pregnant and died
 
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
prior to you know the beginning of a
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
year or all the way through postpartum a
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
year after her actually delivering her
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
baby our first case that we received
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
actually was identified through a family
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
member who called Maternal Child Health
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
looking for help because her daughter
 
01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
had died and they had a four week old
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
baby and she was looking for help so
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
that case really opened our eyes to what
 
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
was happening with women of childbearing
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
age within that one year period and she
 
01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
had died in an emergency room in a small
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
rural hospital and the her symptoms were
 
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
the worst headache of my life so as we
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
began the process of really trying to
 
01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
understand as you're hearing from I
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
think the other people who presented to
 
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
you today you know what could have
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
happened and could this death a real
 
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:20.699 align:start position:0%
purpose in this is could this death have
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
been prevented so as we investigated
 
01:45:26.209 --> 01:45:26.219 align:start position:0%
that gay a case from a small rural
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
community you know in Northern New
 
01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that team much like the others
 
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
that have been described really wanted
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
to understand was there something they
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
could have done differently to have
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
cared for this woman before they walked
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
into the the room where she had been in
 
01:45:43.490 --> 01:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and she had passed
 
01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:44.169 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and she had passed
away

01:45:44.169 --> 01:45:44.179 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
our committee as you'll see on page 11
 
01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
is comprised of about 28 to 29 people
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
which is about 50 percent event clinical
 
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
people to help us uncover some of the
 
01:45:59.209 --> 01:45:59.219 align:start position:0%
the challenges of these cases before us
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
but also 50 from both um our public
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
sector you know women who are a child
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
bearing age but also all of our other
 
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
support services that really comprise
 
01:46:13.729 --> 01:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
the care that a woman gets in our
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
community so I'm happy to describe more
 
01:46:18.970 --> 01:46:18.980 align:start position:0%
information but it's such a robust
 
01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
effort to really to really mostly
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
identify was it preventable and what
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
kinds of things both from an inpatient
 
01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
setting but also from the community
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
services could have been more robust
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
that might have prevented this situation
 
01:46:38.050 --> 01:46:38.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
and now introduce two of my colleagues
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
first the maternal and child health
 
01:46:48.850 --> 01:46:48.860 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist Dr Caroline I am a Segi
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
and Dr Daisy Goodman uh from also from
 
01:46:56.450 --> 01:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
that Quinn Daisy is the also the
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
director of
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:07.729 --> 01:47:07.739 align:start position:0%
integrated Women's Health Services at
 
01:47:09.070 --> 01:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth health
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you and we'll be back up for
 
01:47:12.119 --> 01:47:18.410 align:start position:0%
so thank you and we'll be back up for
questions

01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all for giving us this
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share the maternal
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
mortality data so I love us to
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
um bring you all to attention of page
 
01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
seven seven and eight where we have
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
reported the data that
 
01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.609 align:start position:0%
reported the data that
um

01:47:33.609 --> 01:47:33.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
data for 2020 and 2021
 
01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
so there were five pregnant Associated
 
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
deaths in 2020 and 6 in 2021
 
01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:45.179 align:start position:0%
two of those deaths occurred during
 
01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and nine occurred postpartum
 
01:47:49.490 --> 01:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
so as you can see most of the deaths are
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
occurring after they uh mother gives
 
01:47:52.679 --> 01:47:54.229 align:start position:0%
occurring after they uh mother gives
birth

01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
birth
 
01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
and on page eight we we have shown that
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
over those deaths were full cardiac were
 
01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
so we also used New Hampshire aggregated
 
01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
data from maternal mortality review
 
01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
application that is the marine
 
01:48:20.890 --> 01:48:20.900 align:start position:0%
application which we use for data
 
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
abstraction to report other
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
characteristics associated with deaths
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
which occurred in New Hampshire from
 
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
2017 to 2021 so that's
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
um shown on page 28 to 23 uh 28 page 30
 
01:48:39.290 --> 01:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
but I love to just highlight uh page 28
 
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
so I wish to bring to your attention
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
that more than half of all the
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
pregnancies Associated deaths which
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
occurred in New Hampshire between 2017
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
to 2021 were caused by overdose and mmrc
 
01:48:56.810 --> 01:48:56.820 align:start position:0%
determined that substance use disorder
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
and mental health were the main
 
01:49:01.609 --> 01:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
contributing factors so this has been
 
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
the story over and over we are seeing
 
01:49:05.410 --> 01:49:05.420 align:start position:0%
more over those deaths among the
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
pregnant Associated deaths and as my
 
01:49:09.119 --> 01:49:10.629 align:start position:0%
pregnant Associated deaths and as my
colleague

01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
colleague
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
Daisy will be giving you some of the
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations which the mmrc comes up
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
with so that we can prevent these uh
 
01:49:21.490 --> 01:49:21.500 align:start position:0%
deaths thank you all
 
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to discuss
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
our maternal mortality committee
 
01:49:28.370 --> 01:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
recommendations as are outlined in this
 
01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
report Pages 8 through 10 and to give
 
01:49:33.129 --> 01:49:33.139 align:start position:0%
you an update on our progress in
 
01:49:34.729 --> 01:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
implementing some of those
 
01:49:34.739 --> 01:49:36.830 align:start position:0%
implementing some of those
recommendations

01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
that implementation is done as a
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
collaboration between DHHS and napkin
 
01:49:45.050 --> 01:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
so as mentioned before the purpose of
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality review is really to
 
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
identify the causes and factors that
 
01:49:51.649 --> 01:49:51.659 align:start position:0%
contribute to maternal deaths and then
 
01:49:53.570 --> 01:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
to identify whether and how they could
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
have been prevented and then
 
01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
subsequently because we're not in this
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
just to report we're all also in this to
 
01:50:01.850 --> 01:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
do something about it the committee
 
01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:05.219 align:start position:0%
makes recommendations about areas where
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
Improvement could have happened that
 
01:50:11.209 --> 01:50:11.219 align:start position:0%
could have been potentially preventative
 
01:50:11.219 --> 01:50:12.830 align:start position:0%
could have been potentially preventative
um so

01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
um in this report uh the mmrc
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
recommendations are described and I'll
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
give you just a sample of those and the
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
implementation of them by the New
 
01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:26.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DHHS and napkin
 
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
um so for first the mmrc has recommended
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire participate in the
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
National Alliance for Innovation on
 
01:50:35.450 --> 01:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
maternal Health which is a national
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
program of the American College of
 
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians and gynecologists which
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
aims to reduce maternal mortality this
 
01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:44.699 align:start position:0%
is implemented state by state and I
 
01:50:47.450 --> 01:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
think 49 out of 50 states or maybe by
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
now it's 50 states our members and we're
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
excited that in 2020 New Hampshire was
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
approved for participation in this
 
01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.250 align:start position:0%
approved for participation in this
Alliance

01:50:58.250 --> 01:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
Alliance
 
01:50:58.260 --> 01:50:59.689 align:start position:0%
Alliance
um secondly

01:50:59.689 --> 01:50:59.699 align:start position:0%
um secondly
 
01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
um the mmrc recommended on that napkin
 
01:51:04.490 --> 01:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement a harm reduction
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
education program for all birthing
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
facilities which will educate both
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
providers and families about the risk
 
01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
for postpartum relapse and the potential
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
for overdose based on our New Hampshire
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
data which shows that overdose is indeed
 
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
the leading cause of loss of life for
 
01:51:23.930 --> 01:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
this group of mothers
 
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
so napkin provided information on how to
 
01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
obtain naloxone which is a life-saving
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
medication which can be administered by
 
01:51:33.410 --> 01:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
a family member or member of the general
 
01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
public to reverse an open overdose and
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
save a life this is uh free through the
 
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doorway program so we were
 
01:51:45.649 --> 01:51:45.659 align:start position:0%
able to collaborate with that program to
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
ensure that all of our hospitals knew
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
that this was accessible to families and
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
some of the hospitals I've been able to
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
actually get a supply of naloxone and
 
01:51:57.169 --> 01:51:57.179 align:start position:0%
dispense it to the families of patients
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
who have substance use conditions to
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have the ability to
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
reverse and overdose at home
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
um and also to develop a naloxone
 
01:52:08.890 --> 01:52:08.900 align:start position:0%
education program for nursing staff
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
nepen also holds monthly webinars to
 
01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
support New Hampshire birth providers as
 
01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:17.300 align:start position:0%
was also recommended by the committee
 
01:52:20.290 --> 01:52:20.300 align:start position:0%
and finally on New Hampshire
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
mmrc recommended that nepkin work with
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
DHHS to make sure there was a training
 
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
for hospitals to implement a national
 
01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
peace and discharge education program on
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
post-birth warning signs one of which is
 
01:52:37.129 --> 01:52:37.139 align:start position:0%
the worst ever headache that my
 
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
colleague Vicki referred to so that all
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospitals are now
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
providing patient education about those
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
signs and symptoms to watch Opera and
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
how to get immediate help to patients at
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.290 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
I think that I made stuff there although
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
there are some recommendations that are
 
01:53:00.649 --> 01:53:00.659 align:start position:0%
ongoing and will take longer to
 
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
implement I'll just mention a few of
 
01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:03.530 align:start position:0%
implement I'll just mention a few of
those

01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
um mmrc also recommends that New
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DHHS and napkin continue to
 
01:53:11.450 --> 01:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
develop and deliver public education on
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
the importance of prenatal care
 
01:53:15.109 --> 01:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
especially for people with substance use
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
disorders and the importance of getting
 
01:53:19.689 --> 01:53:19.699 align:start position:0%
Medical Care during the postpartum year
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
and also to partner with our New
 
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire colleagues who are working on
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
community suicide prevention training as
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
we do know that other mental health
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
conditions and lack of mental health
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
services are a significant contributor
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
to the deaths that we see so this has
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
been a big collaborative effort and if
 
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
you look at the end of the
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
um the report there in the appendices
 
01:53:43.729 --> 01:53:43.739 align:start position:0%
there are some of the public education
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
materials which have been developed
 
01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.330 align:start position:0%
materials which have been developed
there

01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
um and finally mmrc also recommended
 
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
that the legislature consider some
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
increasing funding for direct services
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
including improving access to Mental
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
Health Services and maternal Health
 
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
Services generally for the full first
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
postpartum year and I know that members
 
01:54:06.649 --> 01:54:06.659 align:start position:0%
of this committee have been strongly in
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
support of the expansion of postpartum
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and we do very much appreciate
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
that it's very much in aligned with the
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
findings of the committee
 
01:54:18.729 --> 01:54:18.739 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:23.930 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
question

01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
if a woman is pregnant carrying the baby
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh say I don't know six months
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
if they were given the the mother the
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
the drug now the accident if they were
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
given that during the pregnancy does it
 
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
affect the baby at all uh yes great
 
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
question and the American College of
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians and gynecologist has
 
01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:45.179 align:start position:0%
directly addressed that because of
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
course it's a concern about any
 
01:54:48.410 --> 01:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
medication that we give to a pregnant
 
01:54:51.169 --> 01:54:51.179 align:start position:0%
person is it going to cause any any harm
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
the answer is that this actually would
 
01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
save both the mother and the baby
 
01:54:58.490 --> 01:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
because very unfortunately if the mother
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
dies the mother is the baby's life
 
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
support system Right In Utero and if the
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
mother is not breathing and can't
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
provide oxygen then both are lost so
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
um ACOG strongly recommends
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
administering naloxone in the case of an
 
01:55:16.129 --> 01:55:16.139 align:start position:0%
overdose in a pregnant person
 
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative soloway
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman team thank you uh
 
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
I I want to tread lightly into uh Dr Nay
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
masagi's area uh one of the problems in
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
epidemiology is the problem of the
 
01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
missing data
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
and I think that you've done a wonderful
 
01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
job here reporting on deaths identifying
 
01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
which of those were preventable
 
01:55:52.490 --> 01:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
what doesn't get and I must say that
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
your team which is clearly a very
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
effective team
 
01:55:59.209 --> 01:55:59.219 align:start position:0%
um is an expensive team
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
and one might look at this report and
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
look at your team and say well 18 deaths
 
01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's a very expensive effort and it's
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with 18 deaths but what doesn't
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
show up here is the number of deaths
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
that were prevented that's the missing
 
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.010 align:start position:0%
that were prevented that's the missing
data

01:56:19.010 --> 01:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that this oversight
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee and the state needs to
 
01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:27.490 align:start position:0%
committee and the state needs to
understand

01:56:27.490 --> 01:56:27.500 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
that in public and Community Health
 
01:56:33.729 --> 01:56:33.739 align:start position:0%
generally in epidemiology
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
the ghost is the missing data and you
 
01:56:43.010 --> 01:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
can't produce that data it doesn't exist
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
you can't collect it but you need to
 
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
advertise you need to publicize that you
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
have saved many many many more lives
 
01:56:58.910 --> 01:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
then you lost and that's worth the cost
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of the last time I
 
01:57:06.189 --> 01:57:06.199 align:start position:0%
witnessed a conversation between two
 
01:57:06.199 --> 01:57:08.470 align:start position:0%
witnessed a conversation between two
epidemiologists

01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
if you'll permit me Mr chairman it is
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
known in the field that if you laid all
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
the epidemiologists in the world end to
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
end you still couldn't reach a
 
01:57:22.199 --> 01:57:26.810 align:start position:0%
end you still couldn't reach a
conclusion

01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
because of insufficient data
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much that's uh one of I we
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
never thought about it that way like we
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
need to observe and ask hospitals out
 
01:57:41.209 --> 01:57:41.219 align:start position:0%
there like
 
01:57:43.129 --> 01:57:43.139 align:start position:0%
um pregnant women who come in and
 
01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
they're administered the naloxone so
 
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
that way we start collecting the numbers
 
01:57:50.209 --> 01:57:50.219 align:start position:0%
of uh the cases that we are prevented
 
01:57:53.209 --> 01:57:53.219 align:start position:0%
because of this um health education that
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
we are giving because of the naloxone
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
that we are providing for free so that's
 
01:58:00.169 --> 01:58:00.179 align:start position:0%
a wonderful and uh wonderful uh point
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
and I'll love to take it back to our
 
01:58:04.129 --> 01:58:04.139 align:start position:0%
community so that we can work with
 
01:58:06.410 --> 01:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
hospitals in trying to monitor these
 
01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
prevent prevented uh cases thank you
 
01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
yeah we are tracking at least the number
 
01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of naloxone that is being
 
01:58:17.810 --> 01:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
distributed and we've just um so we will
 
01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
be able to report that next year
 
01:58:20.699 --> 01:58:22.010 align:start position:0%
be able to report that next year
foreign

01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
chair I I think I have about four or
 
01:58:29.089 --> 01:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
five questions that are would contribute
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
to our understanding of this report
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
um uh the first point I want to jump on
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
is a representative saloways uh in terms
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
of it's very hard to measure the those
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
that you've prevented but I'm wondering
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
if if a more generic benchmarking could
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
take place to where we just uh take
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
these as a percentage of total live
 
01:58:54.290 --> 01:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
births and then we Benchmark that
 
01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.719 align:start position:0%
percentage nationally so we at least
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
have some gross indicator of whether or
 
01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
not we're in line or out of line or head
 
01:59:08.209 --> 01:59:08.219 align:start position:0%
of line or you know I I think so I'm not
 
01:59:10.370 --> 01:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
an epidemiologist for the record but I'm
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
just curious if that kind of a benchmark
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
would provide useful insight
 
01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
um so I I just want to um interject uh
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
we um New Hampshire participate in
 
01:59:29.450 --> 01:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
monthly actually more than one uh call
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
with our national colleagues and we're
 
01:59:35.209 --> 01:59:35.219 align:start position:0%
very much representative of other states
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
both in terms of our deaths and and what
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
causes the deaths so
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
so I don't I have no judgment on how New
 
01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is doing relative I'm just
 
01:59:48.649 --> 01:59:48.659 align:start position:0%
trying to address the question of how
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
what kind of a metric might be useful in
 
01:59:53.209 --> 01:59:53.219 align:start position:0%
a report like this in the future that's
 
01:59:56.209 --> 01:59:56.219 align:start position:0%
that was my only point there
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
um and then I I guess I'm obligated to
 
02:00:01.729 --> 02:00:01.739 align:start position:0%
jump to the part of the recommendation
 
02:00:03.850 --> 02:00:03.860 align:start position:0%
dealing with budgets
 
02:00:07.129 --> 02:00:07.139 align:start position:0%
I'm looking I had it for a moment uh
 
02:00:09.070 --> 02:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
page nine
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
under ongoing recommendations there's a
 
02:00:15.169 --> 02:00:15.179 align:start position:0%
paragraph two that talks about increased
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
funding for Direct services and so first
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
I want to ask about dedicated funds and
 
02:00:22.129 --> 02:00:22.139 align:start position:0%
then I want to ask about the governor
 
02:00:25.609 --> 02:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget process so on on the
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds is there now a dedicated
 
02:00:32.689 --> 02:00:32.699 align:start position:0%
fund that would support your program
 
02:00:32.699 --> 02:00:34.310 align:start position:0%
fund that would support your program
efforts

02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
do you know if there's a dedicated fund
 
02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.410 --> 02:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
Federal funding we just had a federal
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
site visit yesterday it also receives
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
General funding part of which goes into
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
looking at maternal health care when you
 
02:00:57.530 --> 02:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
say General you mean State funding yes
 
02:00:59.089 --> 02:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no that's all right because
 
02:01:01.070 --> 02:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to struggle with definitions
 
02:01:03.169 --> 02:01:03.179 align:start position:0%
a little bit what I'm what I'm asking
 
02:01:06.290 --> 02:01:06.300 align:start position:0%
about is a dedicated fund a a special
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
fund that's been set up strictly for
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality right uh no there is
 
02:01:18.169 --> 02:01:18.179 align:start position:0%
a again there are dedicated funds for
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
Maternal Child and but that goes through
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget you get that goes
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
the governor through our budget so we
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
put together a budget director Tilly
 
02:01:31.490 --> 02:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
looked at it our fiscal people looked at
 
02:01:34.129 --> 02:01:34.139 align:start position:0%
it and went up to the commissioner
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
yes but there is dedicated funding
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
towards Caroline the more dedicated his
 
02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh synonym it's used in multiple ways
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
and so you're using it differently than
 
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
what I'm using yeah okay
 
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
um so so so that's fine because what I'm
 
02:01:53.089 --> 02:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
hearing is that you probably don't have
 
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
a dedicated Fund in the sense that I'm
 
02:01:58.490 --> 02:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
using the term I think so okay there's
 
02:02:00.649 --> 02:02:00.659 align:start position:0%
there's actually a committee that uh of
 
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
the house that looks at dedicated funds
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
used throughout the executive branch and
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming that you don't have a
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
line item in that dedicated funds book
 
02:02:14.270 --> 02:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm just thinking about creating one
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
for you and and how we would Source it
 
02:02:21.050 --> 02:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
um so then on the governor's budget I
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
assume that in the governor's budget
 
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
process you all provide a recommendation
 
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
to the governor the governor reviews it
 
02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
the that Governor's budget comes to the
 
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
house we look at it that includes
 
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
Federal money that's been earmarked or
 
02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
targeted I'm going to avoid dedicated
 
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
to to this purpose and then we augment
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
it with State funds that's correct okay
 
02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
in the previous
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
in the previous budget
 
02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
how did your budget request to the
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
governor compare with the final budget
 
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
that you received
 
02:03:04.970 --> 02:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.410 --> 02:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's either you know the governor's
 
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
budget included your amount of the
 
02:03:17.689 --> 02:03:17.699 align:start position:0%
microphone yeah yeah we still have we
 
02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
haven't run out of microphones yet Ms
 
02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:20.649 align:start position:0%
haven't run out of microphones yet Ms
Tilly

02:03:20.649 --> 02:03:20.659 align:start position:0%
Tilly
 
02:03:23.450 --> 02:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great question so um
 
02:03:25.370 --> 02:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
for maternal and child health we
 
02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
received what we asked for
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and again Maternal Child Health is
 
02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
very broad one of the things that I also
 
02:03:33.410 --> 02:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
want to note and I appreciate this line
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
of questioning
 
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
um as Rhonda described as Mr Siegel
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
described we have some federal funds
 
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
that help with the review process that's
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
just to help us get the data right and
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
help support our epidemiologists in the
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
report itself there's a recommendation
 
02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
for additional funds for some of the
 
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
Direct Services that is often outside
 
02:03:55.490 --> 02:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
the scope of Public Health and certainly
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
outside the scope sometimes of maternal
 
02:03:59.930 --> 02:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
and child health as well so to your
 
02:04:01.850 --> 02:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
point this is very complicated
 
02:04:05.209 --> 02:04:05.219 align:start position:0%
okay so because I'm a simple guy what
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping is that during the governor's
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
budget process somewhere the money that
 
02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're asking for in paragraph two is
 
02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
requested somewhere in the governor's
 
02:04:18.770 --> 02:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
budget so that the process can consider
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
this request as a normal line of
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
business and not as something
 
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
exceptional to how we ordinarily put
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
money out there yeah and again thank you
 
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
for that question so I think it is some
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
of the things that are requested or
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
recommended within this report are
 
02:04:37.129 --> 02:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
specifically around Direct Services may
 
02:04:39.770 --> 02:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
show up in the substance use the
 
02:04:41.330 --> 02:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
substance misuse budget in the
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
behavioral health budget in the
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
governor's commission budget as well so
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
that is where we would often find those
 
02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:49.609 align:start position:0%
that is where we would often find those
lines

02:04:49.609 --> 02:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
um you know there are other pieces like
 
02:04:55.729 --> 02:04:55.739 align:start position:0%
prenatal care that might be found within
 
02:04:58.250 --> 02:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
public health so again it's there's lots
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
of different places it could show up in
 
02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
the budgeting process to your point
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:09.169 --> 02:05:09.179 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the follow-up
 
02:05:11.089 --> 02:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
I am trying to help you I'm helping you
 
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
help me help you which is on this
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph two of the recommendations
 
02:05:23.689 --> 02:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
I I could use something supplemental
 
02:05:26.930 --> 02:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
that would provide more clarity about
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
how much more money you want and what
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
specific budget line items because I I
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability or the staff to
 
02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
go through the governor's entire Health
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
Care budget and figure out what your
 
02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
what you want so so if you can I Mr
 
02:05:45.649 --> 02:05:45.659 align:start position:0%
Williams maybe you can help communicate
 
02:05:48.649 --> 02:05:48.659 align:start position:0%
this or Miss Tilly you know the idea of
 
02:05:51.609 --> 02:05:51.619 align:start position:0%
if you if you if you supplement this
 
02:05:55.250 --> 02:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
with a supplemental budget by line item
 
02:05:57.290 --> 02:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
where you want State money or some other
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
money I I would have be happy if I'm
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
still around in division three to
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
consider that that proposal thank you
 
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
02:06:11.089 --> 02:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
he chairs division three of Finance
 
02:06:18.050 --> 02:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.589 --> 02:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
or the Scrooge depending on what happens
 
02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're not the Scrooge anybody else any
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
any any any
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
going several times gone thank you all
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
for coming up here thank you thank you
 
02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have one item uh a request that was
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
made by representative Nelson he would
 
02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
like to give an update to something he
 
02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:40.679 align:start position:0%
had said in September and I think this
 
02:06:43.070 --> 02:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
would be quite helpful and it'll also be
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
very brave so representative Nelson
 
02:06:46.729 --> 02:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm going to read
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
the first part quickly so that can
 
02:06:49.450 --> 02:06:49.460 align:start position:0%
eventually get put in the minutes
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
several minutes ago someone expressed
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
concern that fewer and fewer of the
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
elderly are seeking Medical Care in my
 
02:06:59.209 --> 02:06:59.219 align:start position:0%
area of Southern Carroll County we had
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
highs we have a high elderly population
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
many have been using the Frisbee walk-in
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
services or clinic in Wakefield we re in
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
the recent month or so almost all the
 
02:07:12.649 --> 02:07:12.659 align:start position:0%
services provided at this Clinic have
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
ceased this has resulted in many of
 
02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:16.739 align:start position:0%
those using the clinic to just stop
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
seeing a doctor and taking advantage of
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
the services that have been provided the
 
02:07:23.209 --> 02:07:23.219 align:start position:0%
walk-in clinic doctor Services Testing
 
02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
Lab Etc recently The Fosters paper ran
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
an article about the sudden loss of 16
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
plus doctors at frisbee This concerns me
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
both as a resident of the four towns
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
that I represent but also those residing
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
in Rochester and surrounding areas I
 
02:07:41.629 --> 02:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
recognize there is a shortage of doctors
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
and nurses technicians Etc but the
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
sudden departure is my concern concern
 
02:07:49.729 --> 02:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
something has to be looked at I have
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
done some additional research I ask
 
02:07:54.109 --> 02:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
anyone receiving services or connected
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
with Frisbee for their thoughts while
 
02:07:58.729 --> 02:07:58.739 align:start position:0%
