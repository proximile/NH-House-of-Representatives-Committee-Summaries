education component with
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%

pleased to leave and um you're off the
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
hook uh so that being
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
that um the uh other areas which we're
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
looking at that we're looking for more
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
information uh the next build down which
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
we have uh that we'll be looking at
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.149 align:start position:0%
 
159

00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
159
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
and this bill is uh prohibiting spending
 
00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
of special education monies for any
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
other purpose and requiring reporting of
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
fund balances to the school
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
board um we
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
are looking at having a discussion but
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
also most likely holding that bill it's
 
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
not an early
 
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.710 align:start position:0%
not an early
bill

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
um jumping down so people know where
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
we're going uh 12
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
1265 uh penalty for failure to file
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
School expenditure
 
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
reports um we we we're going to have
 
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
more discussion on that as a committee
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
and executing um we're trying to
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
ascertain is that Bill H is that coming
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
directly from the Department of
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
Education or is that something that's uh
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
submitted by the the representive
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
without working with
 
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
doe um 1382 is the special education
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
support for military connected students
 
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh we're still trying to
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
ascertain whether the bill is
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
duplicative of the language that's
 
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:40.519 align:start position:0%
already in our military compact where it
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
says special education services and how
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
they'll be handle when we have a student
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
coming in from a DOD School somewhere
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
else in the country or with the military
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the country and
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
they're moving uh what's the process for
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
addressing the IEP that they carry
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
forward with them uh I believe it
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
spelled out within the military compact
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
but we want to make sure if it's not
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
then we we will be taking up that
 
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
particular bill um next one down 1311
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%

00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
reconsideration policies uh we will be
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
discussing that today and most likely
 
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
taking action on it today
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
1452 Theos of superintendent of schools
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
and business officers uh within the
 
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
school districts we will have discussion
 
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
on that today and and uh and then uh
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
move forward with it uh duties and
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of SAU
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh we will be addressing
 
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
that bill today um commission to study
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
funding of for special education funding
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
that bill is a bill which is got several
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
components within it directions and uh
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing that uh catastrophic Aid
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
special education Aid is uh an issue
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
which must be addressed we see the the
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
benefit of that represent Heath and uh
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%

we'll have some discussion on that one
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not an early bill so we don't
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
have to make any definitive movement
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
today uh registration of high school
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
students to vote uh I understand there's
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment that's 10:14 I understand
 
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment out there we've
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
been working with the assistant deputy
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
secretary of state Aon Hennessy uh there
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%

discussing that and and looking at that
 
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
and also looking at her letter to make
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
sure that the language parallels what is
 
00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
being presented in the amendment and and
 
00:32:44.679 --> 00:32:45.509 align:start position:0%
being presented in the amendment and and
yeah

00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
and I yeah I I that's what I've heard
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
from Aaron and so at any rate we will be
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
discussing and taking that one up today
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
too so those are the 1397 was on the
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
list but uh we've already taken action
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
on that and exact that it's just one of
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
those rollovers that got mixed in with
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
bills and we don't want to take action
 
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
twice and so those are the Bills which
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
discussion there is concern about the
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
effective date of this uh April 1
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
2024 it says it be effective that's
 
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
uh right right upon us that date um so
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
uh that that's a a a concern that a
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
number of folks have raised and we even
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
I think raise addressed that briefly
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
during the presentation of the
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
bill so it's open for discussion anybody
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
want to oh by the way I'd like to
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
introduce uh representative SE and
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
represent Howard and representa Heath
 
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
who are standing in today for subing for
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
here you've been on this committe before

as a full-time member and you're a
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
permanent sub with us and we appreciate
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
that and represent C welcome you're
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so we have uh 1509 any
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
discussion on that Bill yes represent
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
luno sure thank thank you very much Mr
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
chair and um and House Bill
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:57.630 align:start position:0%
chair and um and House Bill
1509

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
1509
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
adds a um adds a provision new provision
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
that says that essentially saying that
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
that this this uh special education
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid can only be spent on
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
special education purposes and so I
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
think we got to we got to maybe take a
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
look at what that means in the uh in the
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
larger scope of um of of public school
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
funding and um and you know one
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
you know sort of finger in the wind
 
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
we've heard it from a number of places
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
we we've actually seen some data that
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
supports it that that the average cost
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
of special education services and this
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
is average and I know averages aren't
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
great numbers there somewhere in the
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
neighborhood at
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
$27,000 per student and the
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid amount of special
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
education is more like
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
$2300 um per student so so that that
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
that amount doesn't even come close to
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
what the uh what the local school
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
district has to raise to uh to perform
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh special education services
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
similarly that that that amount the
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
$2,300 is again just an average and um
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
and you know and isn't isn't based on
 
00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
providing specific Services it is in a
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
formula called adequate school funding
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's for the school district
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
to Pro provide an adequate education for
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
all of its students so I think as we if
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
if if we're starting to peel away these
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
these um um differentiated Aid factors
 
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.710 align:start position:0%
these um um differentiated Aid factors
special

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
special
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
education free introduced price launch
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
English language learning that that
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
we're really we're really walking away
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
from Our obligation to fund an adequate
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
education for all students and uh it's
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
all part of the formula it's part of the
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
formula that calculates the cost of
 
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
providing an adequate education for all
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
of a district students not just special
 
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.150 align:start position:0%
of a district students not just special
education

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
students not just the free inter price
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
launch students not just the English
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
language Learners and and for that
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
reason I I I I don't think this bill
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
should should move forward I would
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
support an itl or I'd support an interim
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
study if um if we want to gather more
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
information on it in conjunct with our
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
our school funding information but but I
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
I certainly don't think the bill should
 
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.990 align:start position:0%
I certainly don't think the bill should
move

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
forward now I'm confused I've wondered
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
this myself a number of times in the
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
past why if we're giving a bump for free
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch are we not using that
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch kids why if
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're giving a bump for special educ
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
ation are we not using that money for
 
00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
special education kids it seems like if
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we're giving the bump for
 
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's what the money should be spent
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
for and I don't understand how that's
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
not adequacy it's adequacy for those
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
kids because they need that extra money
 
00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.390 align:start position:0%
kids because they need that extra money
so

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
I'm can you explain it better when we
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
when we appropriate money for the
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
there's two components which go into it
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
the base cost right and the
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and the Constitution
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
says that we have to fund all children
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
equally regardless of property wealth or
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
property poorness within a community so
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's based on the child children your
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
per per
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
admr and so so then we allocate the it's
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
not Target none of the differentiate Aid
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
is it's listed as free and reduced or
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
elll or or or special education
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
but a superintendent does not
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to use those monies
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
directly they're they're non-targeted
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
dollars and we've had this issue when
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with the LBA many many times
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
in trying to develop formulas and that's
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why we always look at
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
the left-and side of the formula and the
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
right hand side of the
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
formula so it is you know it's it's a
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
difficult issue but we've tried to go
 
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
the other way around and and we've been
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
told we can't do it so my my concern
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
with this bill would be I like the
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
content of the intent uh however a
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent I'd like to right start
 
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
right down the lower level when we're
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
starting to build our budgets in a
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
school district superintendent is
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
building a budget off of what money St
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
and and off the the demographic on the
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
preceding year they don't know what's
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
coming at them in many cases in terms of
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
special education population for the
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
given year that they're planning for so
 
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
they have to Bas basically project or
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
estimate the best way that they can so
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
where do they get these additional
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
dollars from is money's raised locally
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
within your community or from that pot
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
that you get from the state which
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes doesn't measure up to what
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
you really are projecting so you have to
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
make that difference up so what happens
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
at the end of that given year after
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
that's been approved by your legislature
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
in your town and there is money left in
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
that pot but there's another a of your
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
operating budget which is lower are can
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
they move those dollars that were
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
appropriated by your town which are not
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
State dollars necessarily from the
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
special education accounting form budget
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
and move it over here this bill would
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
stop that from happening so that's where
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
I'm in between so how how do we how do
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
we handle this whole thing if if they
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
can't it's going to have to stay over
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
that that pot even though they have
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded things on this
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
side chair lad
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for for raising
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
that um ra making that point chair U Mr
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's it almost goes right to the
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
fundamental point of school boards too
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of bottom line budgeting and um
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
where where School boards have the
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
authority to um to to appro not to
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate but to use funds as as the
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
elected school board members feels
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate particularly as you get
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
towards the end of the um the school
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
year and and I think this bill
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
um is antithetical to that sort of local
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
control that uh that school boards
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
have represent Bel thank you Mr chair so
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
obviously being a newer member to this
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
committee our comp our our funding
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
formulas are very complicated um I've
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
heard number of times that places
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
struggle with funding for uh special
 
00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:02.270 align:start position:0%
struggle with funding for uh special
education

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
needs I was frankly shocked when I heard
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that we actually have a line
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
item for special education and not all
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
those funds are used for special
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
education it seems to me
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
unconscionable that we would actually
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
Rob from a fund that is specifically a
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
line item for special education needs
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
that are we know are not funded well
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
enough in many places and we would use
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
that for any other
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
purpose now I uh the committee is
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
probably familiar with the fact that I
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lover of the concept of equity
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
I don't like it
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
except except when it comes to students
 
00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.430 align:start position:0%
except except when it comes to students
with

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities and I think we all tend to
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that students with
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
disabilities need a little something
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
extra sometimes in order to participate
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
freely and I think that's a universal
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
concept we've had that since Civil
 
00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
Rights Act but I I can't understand why
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
we would use these funds for anything
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
but these students especially when
 
00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
they're not adequately funded as
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
is represent
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I have a couple
 
00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.990 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I have a couple
of

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
remarks I'm going to start with
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that I was here for the
 
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
entire hearing on this bill listening
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
intently and making many notes and I did
 
00:43:17.549 --> 00:43:17.559 align:start position:0%
not hear what representative beler just
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
cited I did not hear that we're robbing
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
money from a special ed fund for other
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
things so I'm a little perplexed by that
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to also note we heard
 
00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
testimony that most many specialed
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
students receive most of their education
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
in the general education setting and
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill is very
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
unclear as to if it were to
 
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
pass how we would separate out the
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
special education cost for students who
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
are included in gened it's just your Ed
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
educating those children in the
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
classroom meeting their
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
needs it's just not clear at all how
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
that would work um I very much
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
supporting itl on this
 
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
bill perhaps I'm Miler thank you Mr
 
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to Echo uh
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's comments but I
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
want to add too
 
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
that special education has
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
a certain
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
oversight on each School Board uh there
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
are a limited amount of money that is
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
and we've heard that time and time again
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
from various testimonies on various
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
bills about the Dilemma of of specialed
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
money and the lack thereof from the
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
state to do that we heard
 
00:44:46.589 --> 00:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
testimony uh from a superintendent that
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
basically said look at there are reports
 
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
that go on all the time almost on a
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
monthly basis so the oversight for the
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
expenses of special ed are very clear
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
and this bill is not needed because of
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
that oversight and the preeminence of
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
the need to look at this on an ongoing
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
basis so this is not some kind this is
 
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
not some kind of a fund that gets put it
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
to the side or get puts to put in the
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
rear someplace this is up front on a
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
monthly basis and a school board meeting
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
and so I I think that that this is not
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
needed and uh I would it all this
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
motion represent cascaden thank you Mr
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
chair I was trying to look at line five
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
and six and trying to
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
process how to interim study if that's
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
the way it went um but I'm coming up
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
short in
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
practicality your special ed budgets do
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
have line items and are reported by line
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
item line item if Jane do Needs A CTV
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
then that's you know a piece of
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
equipment in that that line item um if
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
somebody else needs an individual Aid
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's an align item for personnel
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
specific to special ed and it is tracked
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
a school board must approve all of those
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
expenses every time they meet so they
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
call warrants and then in my experience
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
those warrants all went to the city and
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
the city had to sign off on all of those
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis as
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
well um at the end of a year when you're
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
looking over your budget and you're
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
trying to work with your town or your
 
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
City on what they're going to
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the following year
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to look to see where you
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
have money left in those line items you
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
might have I don't know couple thousand
 
00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
left in materials or something left in
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
personnel and now you start grouping
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
that whether it's from special ed or not
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
because a city in my case might say well
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
we can only give you
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
x amount of
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
dollars and since you've got Surplus
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
here you know we'll put that right back
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
into your budget where it
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
is um another piece is um negotiating
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
that Medicaid
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that becomes a revenue for
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
the school district in essence a revenue
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
for the town or the city and so it goes
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
in the revenue pot so again when you're
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
negotiating to get your school budget
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
funded my experience is you never get
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
what you want and you never get what you
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
request but it's negotiated they'll say
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
well we'll give you all the revenues
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
from Medicaid to put back into they
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that if they need a
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
plow open your schools in the
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
winter it may go there but it's in that
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
end part um the other piece your budget
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
in particular and special ed can change
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
on any given day take for example
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
example a family that starts a school
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
year has three students in your in your
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
District all three require special
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
education services then come February
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
and March that family packs up and moves
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
now you might have extra Personnel you
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
might have bought special materials for
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
any one of the children or provided
 
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
services so now those dollars aren't
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily expended so you get a
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
balance in those areas you may have a
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
student all of a sudden whose Foster
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
family moves to the city which has
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
happened and the city is now responsible
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
to pay the education of that student
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
wherever they are in my case they were
 
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.150 align:start position:0%
wherever they are in my case they were
in

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
Dairy um so it's that fluid on Special
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
Ed but at the end of the
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
day most of those dollars all stay in
 
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
special end because if there's something
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
that you've been wanting to purchase for
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
the need of something and you have extra
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
money you have that flexibility to do
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
that what I'm worried about is this bill
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
would prevent you from being able to use
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
your dollars where they are best served
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
towards kids so I I I don't need it Echo
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
that and I'd say itl when I was putting
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
budgets together and if I did have a
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
balance left in an account like that but
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
I also looked over here and said our
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
fuel tanks and the buildings are
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
empty and the the price of fuel now is a
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
great buy and if I wait it's going to
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
spike why not put that money over here
 
00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:35.079 align:start position:0%
to save the taxpayer dollars later and
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I did and so it it's and and
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
the balance often times was a result of
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
just what you said you're projecting but
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
the projection is maybe projected higher
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
because somebody left or or any
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
circumstance variable so those are some
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
things which have to be considered that
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
local have to be left with that decision
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
making ability yeah represent dry thank
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
you and maybe representative cascad or
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
you could answer where to federal funds
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
targeted I don't think
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
they're Ida funds stay in idea because
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
those are through the grants management
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
system that they're they're not the type
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
that are raised through your community
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
which appropriated locally they're
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
different and you have to use them
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
accordingly in accordance with federal
 
00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
ed and other discussion represent Tanner
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
aren't the federal aren't the federal
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
funds generally overseen by the
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that they're the
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
ones that kind of keep track of well
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
there it's reporting back yes yes it's
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
discussion okay um
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
know we're we're we'll have a caucus

represent cordelli and second by
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
represent Miler further
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
discussion yes um very simply um in
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
statute now um
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
it says that um you can have a
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent but it's not required to
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
have a superintendent as long as there
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
is someone assigned to perform
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent Services which are
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
defined in statute um in several many
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
places throughout though um given our
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
education statutes um it says the the
 
00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.390 align:start position:0%
education statutes um it says the the
superintendent

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
shall Etc so this clarifies in all those
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
places um that this superintendent shall
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
or Personnel assigned to perform
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
superintendent Services Under RSA 194 C5
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
Etc so it's a clarification about um the
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
statute further discussion yes represent
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman L I have
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
reservations about the bill because it
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
looks to me like it is is strictly
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
administrated way to reduce costs and
 
00:59:52.109 --> 00:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
has nothing to talk about improving the
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
education of the youngsters in the
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
district or the efficiency see the
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
administrative office um so I from that
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill representative kiscaden thank you
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
26 does that mean that you could assign
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
a principal to be the superintendent and
 
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
Licensing would not come into play here
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
or am
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
I does it mean like you can assign
 
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
anybody to take over if you don't have a
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent in the district um I
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
believe that U I wasn't sure anyone can
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
be assigned any sorry yeah thank you uh
 
01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
anyone can be assigned um to perform the
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
superintendent Services it could be
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
steep uh is
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
there Barett do you have any
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
clarification on that that so we can get
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
beyond what I
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
believe because I I I was always under
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
the impression that in a single School
 
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
District that's usually your small
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities thank you thank you
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
chairman L good morning members of the
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
committee as I testified during um
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
during the hearing on the bill um there
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
is for smaller districts there's a a
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
specific certification from the
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
Department called a district
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
administrator certain criteria no I
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
think it's only one building and fewer
 
01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:31.039 align:start position:0%
than a certain number certain number of
 
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
students it's almost I called it
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
principle plus that individual serves as
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
a principal but is um authorized through
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
that certification to sign certain
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
documents I presume both for the state
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
and feds if need be um representative
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
cordelli to your to your comment a
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
second ago about the assignment of
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent services to perhaps a
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
principal or a a business manager our
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
understand understanding is that the
 
01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
individual that is assigned um to
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
perform those superintendent Services
 
01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
would still have to have superintendent
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
certification the provision in RSA 194c
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
I forget what sub paragraph it is um
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
four maybe or five where it talks about
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
um assigning the services um the only
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
situation there may be more but the only
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
one that I'm aware of in New Hampshire
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
where a district does not have a quote
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
unquote superintendent in place um
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
is uh the Middleton School District
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
essenti actually there's two now that I
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
can think of the middlet the Middleton
 
01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
School Board purchases its services from
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
the governor Wentworth School District
 
01:02:39.549 --> 01:02:39.559 align:start position:0%
um so governor with the superintendent
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
and Governor Wentworth through a
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
contract with middle with Middleton
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
performs their Middleton superintendent
 
01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:47.559 align:start position:0%
Services whether or not that's all the
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
central office services I don't know I'm
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
also aware that Rollinsford purchases
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
its superintendent services from uh
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
summersworth uh there may be more but
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
those are the two that I'm aware of so
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
you either need again our understanding
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
is that the individual we need to have
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
uh certification from the Department as
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
a superintendent or in the circumstances
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
I talked about that District
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
administrator position where I think
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's only one in the state that is
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
doing that now and there were a couple
 
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
other that have have tinkered with it
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 or 15
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
years represent um I believe that the
 
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:24.910 align:start position:0%
years represent um I believe that the
town

01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
Monroe um had a part-time superintendent
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
for years and then the acting principal
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
um then assumed that role but she had to
 
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
um become certified as a superintendent
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
so I believe she's dual certified it's
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
it's possible yeah I know Monroe went
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
with the district administrator model
 
01:03:46.109 --> 01:03:46.119 align:start position:0%
for a while I know lime did it for a
 
01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
while um and um Mason is the one that
 
01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
has done it pretty successfully for I
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
want to say the last maybe close to
 
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
moving on 15 years would be my
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
guess that's a small district and they
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
went back to an uh got a superintendent
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
been retired in brought out of
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
retirement where was where was that sir
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
mon in Monroe yeah yeah but I believe I
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
mean my experience as an interim is that
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
a district is purchasing the services of
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
a licensed superintendent and that's why
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
you see a lot of
 
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
interim retirees that do these jobs
 
01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
right because they but for the purposes
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
of not having a quote unquote B
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
in the central office if you will
 
01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
they're they're providing they're
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
purchasing the service Middleton is its
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
own SAU purchases services from the
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
governor wler School District SE 49 I
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
believe it is um Rollinsford is its own
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
School District it's their their own sa
 
01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:41.799 align:start position:0%
they purchase their central office
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
services from
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
summersworth so is this by way of
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
Statute or by uh Ed education rule well
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
the certification is obviously rules the
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
the the purchasing of services is in
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
194c I'm 34 something something
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
on superintendent Services I was
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
concerned more with the certification
 
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
aspect it was reing the BB
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
certified I see all the services there
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
I've looked them there's a Litany of
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
them right down through a through R
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
correct it says
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
um anyway you're providing the services
 
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
the district has to provide the services
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
you can do that either by having your
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
own superintendent or Again by hiring
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
paying to have a a superintendent in a
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
neighboring District provide them for
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
you okay representative
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
Balon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um can you
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit further what is
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
that uh District Administrative um
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
position that uh people can qualify that
 
01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
can take the place of a superintendent
 
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
and what does that entail in terms of uh
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
extra work or sure thank you very much
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative um so the district
 
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
administrator that is a a title of a job
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
position that is a certified position
 
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
under Department of Education roles I
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
presume it's in the 500s
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere um it it the person if you
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
have a district administrator
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
certification generally in the
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances the two or three districts
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
that have tinkered with that model over
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
the years that individual that holds
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
that certification is serving as a
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
principal of a small school their
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
day-to-day job is primarily being the
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
principal of that school however that
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
District ad administrator certification
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
authorizes that individual to sign off
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
on on documents that would be required
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education the feds
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
um that would normally be required to be
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
signed by the superintendent I think
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's really the only distinction is
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
that it's a principal certification
 
01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of coursework if you
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
will for but not as much as a
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent um but the individuals
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
are serving as a principal you know from
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
7:30 to 5:00 but then they're authorized
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
to sign whatever documents would need to
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
be signed the warrant the Dr stuff the
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
idea stuff the federal stuff all that
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff but the so I hope that
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
answers your question and and there are
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
limitations on on districts that can't
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
have a district administrator it has to
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
be a small District there's a cap on the
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
number of students and a cap on the
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
number of buildings within that District
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
in order to have a district
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
administrator serving that
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
role Bon um can um somebody who wants to
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
apply to be a district administrator is
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
there like a a temporary where you can
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
say you're going to do it and work
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
towards it and still have the role yeah
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the thank you for the
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
question I I I don't know if I don't
 
01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
know the certification rules is but
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
maybe as well as I should just I'm not
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
an educator so I don't I'm not exactly
 
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
sure how that how that works through the
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
department further
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you very represent he
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you we are for
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um the role of the
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent um is pretty extensive um
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
and with that role they carry all the
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
liability I mean the buck stops with the
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent so in this case where's
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
the buck going to stop in I'm sorry in
 
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
what case representative the in the
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
situation of of this bill I I don't I I
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
remember the bill I don't have a copy of
 
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
I thank
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
so will will this position carry the the
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
liability for that District I
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:55.709 align:start position:0%
liability for that District I
mean

01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
I think in in and and reading through
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
the bill again in relative to the the
 
01:09:02.669 --> 01:09:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
measures I think as I'm reading the bill
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
and not speaking to your intent
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli I'm reading the
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
bill as for the fire for the fire safety
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
then well Personnel assigned I
 
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:24.950 align:start position:0%
then well Personnel assigned I
mean

01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent I'm sorry I'm a little
 
01:09:34.110 --> 01:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to piece together a couple
 
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
each and may
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
assign okay so reading the current law
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have and you may
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
assign these services to one more sort
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
of personnel working for
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
part-time or such Services maybe
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
independently contract raed I'm not
 
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
aware of any districts that have the one
 
01:09:59.149 --> 01:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
or more administrative Personnel working
 
01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
for part-time the services well or if
 
01:10:03.159 --> 01:10:05.630 align:start position:0%
for part-time the services well or if
they

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
are I could probably use some help from
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
an administrator maybe um
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
um you know so so what I if we look at
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
the superintendent services in RSA 194
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
C4 paragraph 2 that a through R the
 
01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent is ultimately responsible
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
for the but those are certainly
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
delegated to a special education
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
director a business manager a principal
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth so you know Jerry I
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to speak to sort
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
of the assigning the duties and how it
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
may are they delegated by the school
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
board I mean generally no I mean we we
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
tend to advise that the superintendent
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
works for the board but all other
 
01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
employees work for the superintendent
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
because the superintendent is respons
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
responsible in 194 C4 paragraph 2 for
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
the um uh oversight and evaluation and
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
supervision of all employees with the
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
district and we're talking a very small
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
District yeah I mean well small or large
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
the super inent is ultimately
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for all the employees within
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
within the
 
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
district we could be talking about a
 
01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
district like landf that has 40 kids
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
right right and I mean I'm looking at
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
the you know I I'm looking at the 194
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
C5 superintendent shall not be required
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
and may assign I I I think you know I
 
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
think I think representative cordell's
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
sort of interpretation or take on that
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
provision in in C5 2A that the
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
superintendent May assign is not
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
required to have a superintendent and
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
may assign these services to one or more
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
administrative personnel and so if
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
you're assigning this the services to a
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
director I don't know who's in charge
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
like who's signing off on the pertinent
 
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
documents that are required under both
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
state and federal law looking to the
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
looking to some of the administrators
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
and well thank you Mr let's hear Jerry
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%

01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
legal training and other than what I
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
needed to achieve my degree so I don't
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
know the legal compon onon of and can
 
01:12:28.629 --> 01:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
site as brilliantly as Barett can
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
chapter and law of of what things are
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
um but ultimately in in each district um
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
and i' I've as Barrett's been talking
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
I've been running through my head who
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
our current folks are and I'm not aware
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
of any District uh that has anyone who
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
is not certified as a superintendent
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
serving that purpose you may recall
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday I alluded to the small
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
District of Hill
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
and Brian Conley who is serving in many
 
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
capacities but he holds a ticket as a as
 
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:01.629 align:start position:0%
capacities but he holds a ticket as a as
a

01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
superintendant um uh and I believe the
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
district administrator that who who BR
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
Barrett refers to also holds
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
certification as a superintendent so um
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
and the part-time many of the part-time
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
positions that are filled uh by folks
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
are typically filled by retired
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
superintendant uh that don't serve in
 
01:13:24.239 --> 01:13:24.990 align:start position:0%
superintendant uh that don't serve in
the

01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
legislature um but many of
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
those um many but all of those part-time
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
folks hold a credential as a
 
01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
superintendent and in another piece of
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that you'll uh contemplate
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
today uh offers some flexibility if you
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
will in Pathways toward uh
 
01:13:44.639 --> 01:13:45.910 align:start position:0%
will in Pathways toward uh
superintendent

01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
certification um we've mused a bit about
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
the duties and responsibilities of the
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent because the i i i digress
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
to share a funny story with you funny in
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
some ways uh we had a superintendent
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
show up at a meeting earlier this year
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
who the day before had dawned his pit
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
boots with a chainsaw uh because his
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
facility manager was ill and couldn't
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
perform the function of destroying the
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
Beaver Dam that was about to flood
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
school property and so the
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent said well we can't have
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
that happen and there's no contractor to
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
do it so on with the waiters and in to
 
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
the swamp and business with a chainsaw
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
that's nowhere in you know a through z
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
even not other duties as aign because
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
nobody ass signed that so there's there
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
are different things that that folks do
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
and it has no that particular uh
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
instance has nothing to do with
 
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
certification but is just an example of
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
what what's bothering me where the
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
stops we're talking about small
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
districts here and and
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
that instructional leader that principal
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
instructional leader probably knows the
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
town a whole lot
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
better than the contracted servic is
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
sitting 50 mil away or 20 miles away and
 
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
has a ticket and um we're looking at
 
01:15:13.229 --> 01:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
instructional decisions and
 
01:15:13.239 --> 01:15:14.629 align:start position:0%
instructional decisions and
administrative

01:15:14.629 --> 01:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
decisions many
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
principles have it's just like you can
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
have a CES a certificate Advanced study
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
or have a PhD as a superintendent but
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
many of these principles have the
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
finances that's been part of their
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
master's program uh they certainly have
 
01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:33.390 align:start position:0%
master's program uh they certainly have
you

01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
know awareness of where the statutes are
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
they can read a book just like a
 
01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent can you just as said
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
you're you're not an attorney either um
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
so so why is this
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
not what is wrong with this bill where
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get this instructional
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
leader in a small District to make these
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
decisions other than some regulation
 
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
saying we have to have certification to
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
do that thank you then I don't know if
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
you're asking either one of us but I I
 
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
just in looking through the statutes
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
again in C5 and then readings line 10
 
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:10.870 align:start position:0%
again in C5 and then readings line 10
and

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
11 and then reading lines 15 and 16 it's
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
at least consistent right the the the
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
the provisions in lines 10 and 11 and 15
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
and 16 are consistent with the language
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
in in C5
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
A2 um the the the as I testified I don't
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think we took a position on this
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
bill I I may be mistaken on that the the
 
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
provisions at the end in lines 23
 
01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.270 align:start position:0%
provisions at the end in lines 23
through

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
27 the the the principal instructional
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
leader again that's not that position is
 
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
not a certified position under depart
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
current Department of Education roles
 
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
the district administrator is what I
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
believe this is is trying to get at so
 
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's an incon there's consistency in
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
language on 10 and 11 with C 194 C5
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
consistency in lines 15 and 16 with
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
current Statute in 194
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
C5 we think there's an inconsistency in
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
203 through 27 with what the current
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education roles
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
are represent
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
cordelli yeah um as I said
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
the intent was very
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
simple we talked about C5 uh 2A School
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
District shall not be required to have a
 
01:17:37.629 --> 01:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent May assign those Services
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
that's what I tried to reflect because
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
there are places 20 some odd places in
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
statute where it says the superintendent
 
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
shall and I thought for consistency
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
purposes we should
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
reflect you know for a change maybe um
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
you know what is inste statute elsewhere
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
in our education statutes um the bottom
 
01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
of the um Bill related to 23 through 26
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned um was given to me um
 
01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:07.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
department Steve gave you that right
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yes represent
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
Tanner um I I see that the the bottom
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
number number four um is for single
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
District school administrative units um
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
but the other ones just say
 
01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools for school
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
districts uh so it really isn't just all
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
small schools it's it's any district and
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
wondering um My worry is that this isn't
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
because there's been so much focus on
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
Administration and how it really eats up
 
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
money and doesn't add to the education
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
of kids and yada yada yada that this
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
bill would be a vehicle for getting rid
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent when I drafted this my
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
intent was not to partner this with any
 
01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.669 align:start position:0%
intent was not to partner this with any
other

01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
legislation dealing with superintendent
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
or getting rid of any staff I was trying
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
to provide some consistency in our
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
statutes for a change
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
yeah represent about Cas
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
Caden um in looking in the Bureau of
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
certification they require a lot of the
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
same requirements as a superintendent in
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
terms of a district administrator okay
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
so they need at least a Masters or a
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
higher ed they have to be certifiable as
 
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
a superintendent pretty much but I sort
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
of equate the language in 24 and
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
25 that your dental hygienist is not
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
going to do your root canal or nurse is
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
not going to perform your heart
 
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
surgery and somebody has to maintain the
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
high that puts that's a little
 
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
concerning may I may I comment real
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
quickly on one more thing representative
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
Cordell you said that you got the the
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
principal instructional leader language
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
from from the Department I believe in
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
one of the drafts of the minimum
 
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
standards the 306s I believe that was a
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
consideration at one at one point they
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
were going to put a provision in there
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
about principal instructional leader I
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
think they were defining that again
 
01:20:24.669 --> 01:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
that's gone through a thousand
 
01:20:24.679 --> 01:20:26.229 align:start position:0%
that's gone through a thousand
different

01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
variations um I know Mr bermonte sent me
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
a a draft I think it was label number
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
two earlier this week I haven't looked
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
at it so I don't know if that's still in
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
there so that could have been the
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner working on some of the
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
rules as well too so that that may be
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
where that came from as well to
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
representative so ref San
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
Luna thank you very much Mr chair so so
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
question to both the um you know uh to
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
Barrett with school boards admin um
 
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
School Board Association and to and to
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
Jerry with the school administrators
 
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
Association um looking at the looking at
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
the bill listening to what the prime
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor has said that that the the the
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
the two sections at the top are really
 
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
to sort of clarify that that you know
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
where there's a superintendent or a
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
person that's been assigned the role of
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent um uh can be provided uh
 
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
certain information
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
um and then the and then the last
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
section with with that that now we're
 
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
we're sort of showing a a route for
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who's a building principal to
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
take on the role of su responsibilities
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
of superintendent in a small District I
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
guess my question to both of you is is
 
01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
this really needed um you know when
 
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
we've got either somebody that's hired
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
as a superintendent or hired to perform
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
the role of the
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent um and and obviously both
 
01:22:00.669 --> 01:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
of you are very interested in making
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
sure that school districts have access
 
01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.910 align:start position:0%
sure that school districts have access
to

01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:11.629 --> 01:22:11.639 align:start position:0%
to high you know U superintendent
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
qualified Personnel to lead districts
 
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
that are held to high standards um are
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
we having you know is is this bill
 
01:22:20.639 --> 01:22:21.550 align:start position:0%
we having you know is is this bill
really

01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:25.590 align:start position:0%
really
needed

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
first thank you for the question
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative luno um I would say that
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
we have successfully filled a positions
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
of systems leadership uh we continue to
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
do so through highly qualified
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
candidates I think we
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
need Pathways toward the superintendency
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
that another piece of legislation
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
addresses uh it's absolutely important
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we have um the most qualified
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
people in these systems leadership's
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
position and I'm going to take it a step
 
01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
further and
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
say if you're a principal in a small
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
district and you have the additional
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the superintendent
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
duties of
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
responsibilities principal in a small
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
district has a
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
pretty uh demanding position uh they do
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
everything uh they might not necessarily
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
have a curriculum coordinator they might
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
not necessarily have
 
01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh an IT director they might not you
 
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
know I I've talked about other examples
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
where principles in small District they
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
work pretty hard as it is trying to meet
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
the needs of their staff their kids
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
their families and the community at
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
large and so to to expect even that a
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
principal can successfully uh execute
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
all the duties of uh where the buck
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
stops if you will in addition to the
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
Daily responsibilities of monitoring the
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
lunchroom uh is a is a big stretch and
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
so I think that uh it's um you know
 
01:24:00.159 --> 01:24:01.550 align:start position:0%
so I think that uh it's um you know
we've

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
managed our state has managed to fill
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
those positions and so I would suggest
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
that um we have a system in place that's
 
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
working with a little more flexibility
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
Pell so I was looking at this and yes we
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
all we look at um RSA
 
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
194c no
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
yes 194 C5 Roman numeral 2A which says
 
01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have to have a superintendent
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
and I think the problem here is that if
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
you look at don't read the bolded
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
line just read the the sentence without
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
it it talks about a superintendent shall
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
or this shall be done by a
 
01:24:55.709 --> 01:24:55.719 align:start position:0%
superintendent and the problem
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
is if we don't put that bolded part in
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
to take care of the fact for those
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
instances when we don't have a
 
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent if we don't pat that in
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
the law is saying that a superintendent
 
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
shall be doing this but we don't have a
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
superintendent so I think all this is
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing is by putting that
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
bolded line in there is just to say or
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a superintendent this
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
person because otherwise you have the
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent shall or this shall be
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
done by the superintendent we don't have
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
one thank you thank you for I guess a
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
statement semi- there representative I
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
what what I would say to that is that
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
there is an inherent authority of a
 
01:25:43.229 --> 01:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent to De to delegate the
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't need to be specific if
 
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
it says a superintendent shall you know
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
for example we talked about the services
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
in RSA 190 for 194 4
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
C4 um you know the each school
 
01:25:58.109 --> 01:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
administrative unit or single School
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
shall F provide the following
 
01:25:59.679 --> 01:26:01.149 align:start position:0%
shall F provide the following
superintendent

01:26:01.149 --> 01:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
01:26:04.109 --> 01:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
Services payroll cash flow bills records
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
and files the superintendent isn't the
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
one doing the payroll it's delegated to
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
to other staff so I think that there's
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
just there's a natural and inherent
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
authority of a superintendent to
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
delegate as as needed and I don't mean
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
to be rude if it's okay if Becky came up
 
01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
and took my spot I have to get to
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
another bill at 11:00
 
01:26:24.189 --> 01:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
if that would that be all right by you
 
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair sure thank you
 
01:26:31.629 --> 01:26:31.639 align:start position:0%
perhap Mr chair uh before we vote on
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill and call for the
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
vote would it be possible for us to also
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
1452 which also talks about
 
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
superintendencies and kind of pull both
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
those two bills together so that we can
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
have kind of a full look at what the
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent supposed to do and uh its
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities I mean is that possible
 
01:26:59.070 --> 01:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
to do um the
 
01:27:01.629 --> 01:27:01.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent don't it's not it's not
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
early b not nor is that um but I I have
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
real concerns here and I can reflect on
 
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
my days
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
when don't I was this person this piece
 
01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.229 align:start position:0%
when don't I was this person this piece
here

01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
and the principal in the building which
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
I was when I first started out
 
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
in West Peru Maine I handled all of it
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
all of it the superintendent was
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere up in the Rumford area and
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
never saw us and and I did all that
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
reporting because my master's program
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
had taught me all that and when I left
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
then the district immediately the town
 
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
of West Brew decided we are going to not
 
01:27:46.030 --> 01:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
have superintendent Services we're going
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
to have it through the person we have
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
employed as principal SLS superintendent
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
and we're going to take that credential
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
that the the master's program which was
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
coming out of gorm and it it worked and
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
I can also recall when I was this young
 
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
officer in Vietnam and there every
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
battery out in the field had a captain
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
well the captain was worthless the one
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
that was running the show was the
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
executive officer here was a lonely
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
second Lieutenant than first lieutenant
 
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
and I was able to run that battery
 
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
better than that Captain was and so you
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
can delegate but it's what's above the
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
shoulders which gets the job done and I
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
think if you have a proper person the
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
prop in the place you can get it done
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
and the credentials I yeah I respect
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent and I understand what
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
they've gone through they've just paid a
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
few more bucks for their degree um I I
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
trying to put you down over there but I
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
I I really truly believe that these
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
people can do their job and in a small
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
District you're talking about you're
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to have this contracted
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
service and it's an additional cost for
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
a small community can afford
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
it can we call Caucus please pardon me
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
can we call Caucus not just yet no um we
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
will but you know we're not going to
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
take action on this so at any rate uh
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to get all the people have
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
their hands up first for the discussion
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
represent whitcock thank you chair um
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
I'm listening you talk almost like we
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
don't need any administrat just hire the
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
people can do the job we don't need
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
license you uh I'm must Su Jus you
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
didn't do a hell of a job I'm saying and
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
my my concern my concern is in lines 24
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
25 26 as they were when we took the bill
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
up you know I was going to ask Barett
 
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure Mr Po answer the question
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
currently in doe regulations and maybe M
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
wil could help us because we don't have
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
a doe rep uh attorney here right to help
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
us for doe I I don't see anybody from do
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we have to use other services so
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
the PRP the principal the principal
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
instructional leader is that a is that a
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
may I ask is that a a category is that
 
01:29:55.629 --> 01:29:55.639 align:start position:0%
is that a
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
certification thank you for the question
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
in listening to what representative lad
 
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
was just referencing a principal who
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
also would act in the capacity of having
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
some of these superintendent Services
 
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
under their
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction it's my interpretation and
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
Jerry may feel differently or not but
 
01:30:13.629 --> 01:30:13.639 align:start position:0%
that that person would qualify to become
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
certified as a district administrator
 
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
that is the certification the
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
qualifications it's
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
506.com is the administrator of a school
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
district or an SAU with 400 or fewer
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
total school age enrollments no more
 
01:30:31.870 --> 01:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
than two Public Schools as defined in
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
306 and then it enters out in terms of
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
you have to be a certified principal you
 
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
have to meet the qualifications Etc so
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
that person would fall under that
 
01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.870 align:start position:0%
that person would fall under that
certification

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
probably my point my question M Wilson
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
is um is the title as referred to in
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
that someone may be certified for
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
principal instructional leader there I'm
 
01:30:58.750 --> 01:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
looking right now I I I didn't find it
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't believe that that is
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
a certification title okay so the bill
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
refers to and may certified as a
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
principal stru leader we don't have that
 
01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
position the other question and I I have
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
a difficulty with in line 25 this not
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
end with you just you just had to be
 
01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
stuck there um is the fact we don't have
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
definition of rigorous process it talks
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
about we first of we don't have we don't
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
have the position it's not there there's
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
no certification for that position and
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
we're making it up and then we say we
 
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
have a Rous progress process for
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
selection but we don't have what that is
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
either we don't have a definition what
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
rigorous process is so I I I don't get
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
it so um I understand small schools one
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
gu doing or woman doing a heck of a job
 
01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:40.280 align:start position:0%
and it happens all over oh we're we're
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
not debating with the folks here are
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
Pleasant enough to come up and help us
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
out we're debating amongst a club right
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
here well thank you um since I could
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you but that was my point both of
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
you represent Damon did you have your
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chair representative
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
Woodcock said most of what I was going
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
to say so I will just concur thank you
 
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
you're welc but also in the prior
 
01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
hearing on this and I'm looking at uh
 
01:32:08.119 --> 01:32:09.189 align:start position:0%
hearing on this and I'm looking at uh
line

01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
1819 it was noted that single District
 
01:32:14.669 --> 01:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
school administrative units are not
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily small Manchester and nashaa
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
fall in that category so we need to be
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
careful in looking at this that we're
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
not only speaking of it for these little
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
rural districts there's more in here um
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
I I find this uh the language in
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
the second half of the bill to be vague
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
and very concerning if we had like a a
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
small district with 100 or fewer
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
students would that make a
 
01:32:48.239 --> 01:32:50.629 align:start position:0%
students would that make a
difference

01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:52.390 align:start position:0%
difference
well

01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
represent leus so I have
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
a procedural question as far as how
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
these things come to be so we currently
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
don't have a principal instructional
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
leader but if we wanted one isn't this
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
how we create it through law we create a
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
position I'm not sure but that was what
 
01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
I thought is that we create the position
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
and this describes the position
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's done through the Department of
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
Education is that how it's done that's
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
why I wondered thank you
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
yes Jerry Thank you Mr chairman I I just
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
want to restate we have a vehicle for
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
that exactly what uh representative like
 
01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
I say alluded to is the district
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
administrator that could be the
 
01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent s the principal plus as
 
01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
as Barrett um alluded to we have that
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
certification that's already available
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
for districts who choose that
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
group yeah is there any more discussion
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
amongst the committee representative
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
Heath just want to make a a a comment
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
about um your you talking about your
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
role as an administrator in your school
 
01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
district um I think in
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
fact you carried out a role But
 
01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately the superintendent was
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
overseeing you somehow some way and he
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
or she would be responsible my concern
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
concern with this bill is I don't see
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
who ultimately and I haven't gotten my
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
answer yet about who carries the
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
liability who's making sure everybody's
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
doing the job that they've been
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
designated to do who who where does a
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
buck stop who's
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
responsible would it be the uh as we say
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
on line 24 there the alternative
 
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
certification as principal's
 
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:49.400 align:start position:0%
instructional leader would that person
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
be the one where the buck stops who
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
would it be the school
 
01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:54.950 align:start position:0%
would it be the school
board

01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:34:57.629 --> 01:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
well the the somebody's going to have to
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
recommend the hiring or firing of an
 
01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
instructor or a teacher and that's to
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
the school board the principal doesn't
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
do it right now you recommend to your
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent the superintendent has to
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
take that forward this right here would
 
01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
say that this person in that if it were
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
a small District that's what I've always
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
assumed this is is for the single when I
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
talk single School District I'm not
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
talking Manchester
 
01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
but maybe that needs need some
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
definition here um I was thinking that
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
this person be the one that has those
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
authorities what you're talking so that
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
person is respon if I may so that person
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
is responsible directly to the school
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
board yes and with that carries the
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to oversee and make sure
 
01:35:43.709 --> 01:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
all things are happening the way they
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
should be and if in fact something goes
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
aai is the person that bears the burden
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
of the penalty for that yes thank you
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
yes that that would be the person with
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
those superintendent responsibilities
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
would be this they may not have the
 
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent ticket but they may have
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
the experience to training the Masters
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
that covers that in a small District a
 
01:36:08.669 --> 01:36:08.679 align:start position:0%
very very small
 
01:36:08.679 --> 01:36:10.189 align:start position:0%
very very small
District

01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
yes thanks very much
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
um just following on that line the the
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
the comments made just now um I just
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
want to um mention that I passed around
 
01:36:21.199 --> 01:36:21.830 align:start position:0%
want to um mention that I passed around
uh

01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment which replaces the bill on
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1452 which which Jerry FW was
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
I think referring to earlier that
 
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
addresses credentials for um
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent and school business
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
officers but um uh but my you know I
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
think my point being that that what what
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
you're talking about Mr chair with
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
respect to some of these positions
 
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
whether they're they're
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
um um principal administrators that can
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
that can that can lead a district those
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
All Fall Down fall into the um the the
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
Ed rules for certification for these
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
rules is that
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
correct yeah that they have to go
 
01:37:09.629 --> 01:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
through Ed rules yes right right and and
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
that that possibly what we're what we're
 
01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
talking about here in the bill that's
 
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
before us now and in the the the next
 
01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:18.270 align:start position:0%
before us now and in the the the next
bill

01:37:18.270 --> 01:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
1452 with respect to the qualifications
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
for or um or for certification for these
 
01:37:26.669 --> 01:37:26.679 align:start position:0%
roles they could be looked at together
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
and um and you know and maybe worked on
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
together uh as
 
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
well or they could be worked on as your
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
separately in each each bill that that's
 
01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying yeah yes yes but but
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
recognizing that that that they're both
 
01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
um interrelated yeah okay thank you
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
yeah represent
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
leus so my question
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
comes if a school district as it says
 
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to have a
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent and we're talking about
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
well these people that would be assigned
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
by the superintendent how can we have a
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
person assigned by a superintendent if a
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
school district doesn't have one which
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
the law says they don't have to and so
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
question because when I asked before who
 
01:38:23.229 --> 01:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
would do whatever the answer was well
 
01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
the person assigned by the
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
what that that's not what I was saying
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
at all no I didn't this person would
 
01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
have those responsibilities that the
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
superintend I was going back yeah okay I
 
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
was going back to previous discussion
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
and that it says the superintendent
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
usually you know chooses is somebody to
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
do these the requirements right like the
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
payroll a superintendent would assign
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
somebody to do payroll well if there is
 
01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:01.350 align:start position:0%
somebody to do payroll well if there is
no

01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent which the law says there
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be who makes that
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
assignment superintendent can delegate
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
all they want to if there's no
 
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:15.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent how does it get delegated
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's my question well we're talking
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
about putting it as responsibility
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
within the definition certification for
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
this particular La the way it is now
 
01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
that's why this is here I believe well
 
01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
that was what I was trying to yeah
 
01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:37.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
represent superintendent that also
 
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
happened in l i November um and in both
 
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
instances the school board chair who was
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
signing off on those absolutely
 
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.950 align:start position:0%
signing off on those absolutely
necessary

01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
obviously could do a lot of the work
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
like you say
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
pay but it was a school board chair that
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
was going in to sign
 
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
off out stressing out over it they
 
01:40:07.629 --> 01:40:07.639 align:start position:0%
didn't want the liability but they were
 
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
the ones that
 
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
assumed that charge so there a
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
vacancy now the SCH board
 
01:40:16.199 --> 01:40:18.109 align:start position:0%
vacancy now the SCH board
chair

01:40:18.109 --> 01:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
out okay so I I don't think we're going
 
01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
to get much farther thank you very much
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh on on this I think we do need to have
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
some discussion in our individual
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
caucuses and and maybe uh further
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
discussion on the bill but I don't want
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
to take all day doing
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
it um which we're running down that
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
path would we be voting for a principal
 
01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.350 align:start position:0%
path would we be voting for a principal
instructional

01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
instructional
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
leader who certification when there is
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
no such thing there is no alternative
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
certification right and right
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
now right and it's when I read that it
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
mean if be that we'd be telling doe that
 
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
we want this
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
certification developed to allow what I
 
01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
think the intent is so be voting for it
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
before it was
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
yes sorry Mr chair and members of the
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee for intruding one more time um
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
I I would submit that with principal
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
instructional leader not being a
 
01:41:24.239 --> 01:41:25.870 align:start position:0%
instructional leader not being a
recognized

01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
certification that would that position
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
fall under the code of conduct and
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
ethics we've had that introduced in
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
other areas the district administrator
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
because it's a certified a state
 
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
recognized certified position would fall
 
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
under the code of conduct and code of
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
ethics principal instructional leader
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
isn't a recognized term so I just raised
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
the question would that fall under the
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
code of
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
ethics and the code of conduct because
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's not specific I don't know the
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
answer to that again it's just a
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
question that popped into mind thank you
 
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
yes I know that quelli um intent spoken
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
intent was for small school district you
 
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
and you discuss small school districts
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
as applicable to this bill but um
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
someone over here brought the case could
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
be so I look at it uh through my
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
assistant here helping me very much 1941
 
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
and just on the definition of the single
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
district school district is it possible
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
that a
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester a
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
conquer could be applicable under this
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
law under this bill change could it
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
falls under the definition 1941 of a
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
single School District I know it's not
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
the attempt but if I want to play that
 
01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
game is that possible well the statute
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
have to be changed or there have to be
 
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
added addition to the statute amended to
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
identify whatever the small define
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
configuration was 100 or less but today
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
as it is it could have been a conquer of
 
01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719 align:start position:0%
Manchester I I get that I understand
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to convince me on
 
01:43:06.669 --> 01:43:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%

01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
might might be is there if there is any
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there is or not I don't
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:44:19.589 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.599 --> 02:19:00.429 align:start position:0%
 
just

02:19:00.429 --> 02:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
we're back into session right now and
 
02:19:05.790 --> 02:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do is I'm going to uh
 
02:19:08.589 --> 02:19:08.599 align:start position:0%
recess everything that we're doing right
 
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
now and not take any further action on
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
any bills today and so we will close uh
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
adjourn um the bills which we have been
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
discussing um the the one bill which we
 
02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
have acted upon um I am going to try to
 
02:19:31.309 --> 02:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
get um uh clarification from the clerk's
 
02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
office whether we can count that vote
 
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
minus for example represent luno who was
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
out and of and and I had thought when he
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
went out he checked out with me when he
 
02:19:45.629 --> 02:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
came back in you know uh I should not
 
02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
have allowed him to come in and
 
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
participate in that vote his vote didn't
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
make any difference so it's it's on how
 
02:19:55.630 --> 02:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
this meeting was conducted and so
 
02:19:57.429 --> 02:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
chances are I'd like to go through that
 
02:20:00.190 --> 02:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
bill again and do it properly and and
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
only have those that are voting that are
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
actually seated here uh at the table uh
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
taking action on so another bad vote on
 
02:20:12.910 --> 02:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
that yeah take them both so so at any
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
rate at this point in time the uh the
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
meeting meetings are journ or our close
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:32.349 --> 02:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
you any we're not on anymore
 
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay because I just saying that my vote
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:46.319 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
that
