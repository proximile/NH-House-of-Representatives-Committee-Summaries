00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
good morning um I'm going to call the
 
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary Committee uh to order
 
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959 align:start position:0%
and um before we begin would you please
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
all all right so um we have uh three
 
00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
bills that we um that were voted for
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
interim study that we now need to uh
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
make a decision on as to whether or not
 
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
um we recommend that it's uh that this
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
that the subjects of the bill should be
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
um recommended for further legislation
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislative action in the upcoming
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
session or not um the first one is House
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 1089 and so I would open the our
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
executive session on that bill that
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
um uh eliminating the statute of
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
limitations uh on uh civil actions
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
involving uh p uh contamination and does
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
anyone um wish to speak representa here
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
if you would like to hear from her um
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
sure yes um if you'd like to
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you ranking
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
member Smith um I just have a few brief
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
remarks to let the committee know um
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
that the bill is refiled at this time
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm working to see if there is a new
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
way to determine the length of time
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
explicitly in law that someone would
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
have to seek remedy for a p pasas injury
 
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
um without making an indefinite statute
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
as the bill is written right
 
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
now and I'm actually not sure that as
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
the bill is written right now it would
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
remove any statute of limitations and
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
make that so that people actually have
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
more time I think it might just repeal
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
what was put in law with House Bill
 
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.350 align:start position:0%
what was put in law with House Bill
236

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
236
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
regardless I truly believe and I know
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
because there is a lot of backing behind
 
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
the bill although you see just me that
 
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
an entity would need more time than 6
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
years to um disentangle the very complex
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
situation of liability for the damages
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
to water supplies and to
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
individuals in marac and there is a
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
consent decree that's involved where
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
some of the issues were taken care of um
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
probably more in a Band-Aid type of way
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
which I don't like to say in this formal
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
setting um but I just wanted to give
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
those remarks over to the committee and
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
let the committee know that I've
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
discovered that this is a lot more
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
complex and that um we need a lot more
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
input to take it further so thank you
 
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
for listening to my remarks all right
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
questions for this one yes
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative Val what statute of
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
limitations are you thinking of in your
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.870 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
my what I need to do is sit down and
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
work this out with OSS to some extent
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
because I told them that if we're not
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
able to um write the law in a way that
 
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
gives an indefinite amount of time
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
for a entity or a person to bring suit
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
that um that may not
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
be at all feasible either but is there a
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
way that we can
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
determine an appropriate length of
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
time and in the example of you know a
 
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
person finding out that they are having
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
cancer and then they develop another
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
cancer after they settle so from three
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
years we went to six years but by doing
 
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
that we added a statute into a statute
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
of limitations we prescribe the number
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
and we put it in and to take it out
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
would just revert it back to three years
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell so this is why I'm
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
saying it's really complex but I would
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
like to arrive at a 10year or some what
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
does it take I mean a water supply a
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
city water supply discovers that they
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
have to mitigate how long is it going to
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
take before they know extent of what's
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
going on there when you look you just
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
find more and more and that's the thing
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
about pasas so we do want to hold people
 
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
accountable and this is a number one of
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
an accountability slate of bills that
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
we're bringing forward and we're
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
extremely open to any feedback that will
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
make good statute that doesn't need to
 
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
be tested in the
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
court right other questions for for this
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none uh thank you very
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
much thank you is there anyone else here
 
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
that um wishes to uh say anything about
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
1089 all right uh so representative trip
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
do you have uh I'll make a motion okay I
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
move uh inexpedient to legislate House
 
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
Bill 1089 well well you know no I think
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
the as I understand it there are three
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
three things we can do oh we can uh we
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
can make a we can have a motion for not
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
um that we should that we recommend that
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
the house not take any further action on
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
this subject number one number two that
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
we recommend that the house do take some
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
further action on this subject or if we
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
were split equally then it would be no
 
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation um so in light of that
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative trip do you have another
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
I I I I move that the house take no uh
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
further action on this bill all right
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
and do you wish to speak to that sure uh
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
the the the first reason I had for not
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh wanting to take any uh further action
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
was that uh and an open time limit is a
 
00:17:36.909 --> 00:17:36.919 align:start position:0%
little excessive you know uh
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
uh as a as a cancer survivor I know that
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh U it takes a while for people to uh
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh determine and that the that you do
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
have cancer and possibly what its cause
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
was uh uh the representative's uh uh
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
testimony on uh that uh she's submitting
 
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
another bill you know uh which has you
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
know uh improvements you know makes uh
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
the reason for not taking any action on
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
this bill even more uh logical all right
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
all representative Smith and then
 
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.350 align:start position:0%
all representative Smith and then
representative

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chairman um uh I I
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative trip has
 
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
said but I come to a different conclus
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
clusion it is very definitely because
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill and others who
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
support its concept believe that there
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
is a legitimate issue here that is
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
important we've seen
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
indications um of the fact
 
00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
that that sometimes the principles
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
involved um uh do not in a timely way
 
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.510 align:start position:0%
involved um uh do not in a timely way
indicate

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility and while we recognize
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill as it's written um does
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
not come up to the standard we would
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
like I think it makes very clear that we
 
00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.310 align:start position:0%
like I think it makes very clear that we
should

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill for further
 
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
consideration by the house and knowing
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
that what since this bill is now dead um
 
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
that that what the prime sponsor and her
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
allies will be doing is coming in with
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
an improved version of a bill that
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
addresses a problem that we acknowledge
 
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
did I make that too complicated but I
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
would hope then that we would recommend
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
this issue for further consideration
 
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
Manos Mr chair I just wanted
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
clarification over whether um
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
recommending further action means in the
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
general ener subject area of pasas and
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations or whether it's a
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
decision on this particular bill that I
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
mean I
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
think I think you raise you hit the nail
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
right on the head because I I I think I
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
agree with both what representative trip
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
said and with what representative Smith
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
said and it turns on the very issue that
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
you raised
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
I personally I feel very strong
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
that I could not I don't think I could
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
ever support eliminating the statute of
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
limitations completely for P or really
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
for I I can't frankly it' be hard for me
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
to imagine ever eliminating the statute
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
limitations for you know other other
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
than maybe murder which it already
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply but other than that it's
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
hard for me to imagine why you would
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
ever eliminate the statu limitations and
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
so if we view it narrowly you know are
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
we recommending further legislation on
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
eliminating the statute limitations I
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
would have no problem in saying we
 
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
should not in agreeing with
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative trip on the other hand I
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
think representative Smith's point about
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know is there it
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
it should we say that like you know with
 
00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
what the legislature has already done
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to past we don't have
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
anything further to do I would tend to
 
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
say no we may very well have further
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
things we need to do
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
so in that sense I agree with
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
um and I guess so I let me ask let me
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
just offer this as one Poss and then I
 
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
want to hear from you also represent
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
Smith and anyone else if we I could live
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
with saying something
 
00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559 align:start position:0%
like we we do not
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
recommend further legislation proposing
 
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the statute of limitations
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
but we do believe that there is a need
 
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
for further work in the area of
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
addressing pasas and you know perhaps
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some adjustment in the
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations with regard I
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
could live with
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
that represent thank you um uh
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
representative um in in response to your
 
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
question these bills are now dead that
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's it we are not not going to vote
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
on the bills again um and so anything
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
that happens must come into the
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
legislature in a new bill and what the
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor has just explained in a way that
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
I found quite informative and I hope
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
other people do too that she had she she
 
00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
recognizes two things first there is a a
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
serious problem three serious problem
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
inv related to
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
fast second there is a need to make sure
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
that we have the ability to pursue
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
situations in
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
which people had not acted
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately and three how we do that
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be rethought and
 
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
reconsidered and so recognizing all
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
those three things I think all we have
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
to do is say yes we recommend
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
further action we're not saying this
 
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
bill because this bill is now
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
dead thank you representative hon well
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
just put simply further action already
 
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
is being taken so I would uh I've been
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
inclined to vote to recommend further
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
action because I think I I think her
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
efforts will result in something that'll
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
be very useful and um hopefully we'll be
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
able to pass something next session so
 
00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:58.950 align:start position:0%
able to pass something next session so
other

00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
comments yes represent
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
St I like the uh principle of the bill
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
and this is an important issue and we
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
need to have something to address the
 
00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:12.269 align:start position:0%
need to have something to address the
the

00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh the results of P injuries um but I'm
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
troubled by two things the indeterminant
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
uh period of
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
Discovery and um maybe there should be
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
some sort of evidentiary proof of harm
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
linked to the
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
pasas um I I think it's the bill is a
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
good start but it it needs some
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
important points added to it and so I
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
would be against uh a non-
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
reccommendation and I would be in favor
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
of recommending uh for further
 
00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:49.510 align:start position:0%
of recommending uh for further
legislative

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
action so let me let me ask let me just
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
any first of all anyone else want to
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
comment any other comments so let me ask
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
you rep I'm sorry representative trip go
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
ahead uh this is a a learning action for
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
me today uh so if we were to recommend
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
no further action would that prohibit uh
 
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
filing of a bill no not at all not at
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
all and if we were to uh uh recommend uh
 
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.510 align:start position:0%
all and if we were to uh uh recommend uh
further

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
action would that limit the the scope of
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
what the new bill would say no I think
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know I I mean I'm I I may if
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
somebody has a different view I I think
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
largely what we're doing here today has
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
very little in terms of actual
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
consequences that was my third question
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I suppose it might
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
have is if there turned out to be a
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
controversy down the road next session
 
00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
with some new
 
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
legislation somebody might be able to
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
argue well you know this committee this
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee did recommend further
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
legislation on the one or this committee
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
didn't recommend further legislation on
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
the other hand my sense is that you know
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
that and uh probably $5 will buy you a
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
cup of coffee nowadays um but uh other
 
00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
than that it it probably has not much uh
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
effect thank
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
you um so here's here's let me let me
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion and see if we and just
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
before we take a vote just ask for a
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
show of hands what if we were to say we
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
do not um without in any
 
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
way endorsing or not endorsing the idea
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
of eliminating a statute of
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
limitations um we agree uh we recommend
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
that further action on the issue of um
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
uh uh the problem of past contamination
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh be considered by the legislature when
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
every can I ask if I so if I and I'll
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
I'll write that down to to uh make sure
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
I've worded it correctly um but and then
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
hands can I ask one clarifying question
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
of course is it would we say related to
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
statute of limitation specifically that
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
further act consideration is necessary
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
or just in PS in general because that
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
seems very broad I I guess I would say p
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
in general which I mean wouldn't that
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't certainly wouldn't preclude
 
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
considering statute limitations because
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
I think they're probably is you know I I
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
think we my suspicion is we're not done
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
with uh the whole P issue and not not
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
only dealing with statute limitations
 
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
but other
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:52.750 align:start position:0%
 
going

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
so what so what if
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
uh this would be my motion I I and I
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
just ask for a show of hands vote first
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
um that that our committee say that
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
without endorsing or not
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
endorsing uh the elimination of the
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
statute of
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
limitations um this committee agrees
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
that further legislation regarding P
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
contamination should be considered by
 
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.909 align:start position:0%
contamination should be considered by
the

00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
legislature can I ask for show of hands
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
of people that would support that as a
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%

00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%

legislation regarding PE sure yeah
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine I think I said further but
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
future is fine meanwhile we we better
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
just deal with representative Trip's Mo

a member there but
 
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
he really shouldn't have been replaced
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%

testerman you know what I'm I'm I have a
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
feeling that people may be confused
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
about I think we're right the question
 
00:34:07.109 --> 00:34:07.119 align:start position:0%

Dolan start start can we can I can the
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
the question is to not recommend further
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
action representative trip I I I will I
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
will vote Yes then I I pull my know and
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
and I think we may need to start over so
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
let me let
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
me we've all had it's been I think I
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
hope everybody had a really nice summer
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
and we all have to kind of get back into
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
the into the mode here so as I
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
understand it the motion that we're
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
voting on now is representative Trip's
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
motion that we take no further action
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
which I thought from a show of hands the
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
people that supported taking no further
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
action were representative trip and
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative test um and I had at
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
least the sense from the hand show of
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
hands that everyone else thought we was
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the alternative that I
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
proposed and which if this motion fails
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
I would offer as the next motion um so
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
with that in mind can we we uh call call
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%

um oh yes representative
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
Tre since the motion we just passed is a
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
a fairly n non-standard motion uh will
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
we be given a written copy of that oh
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes you no I'm going to file
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
I will file a report and I'll be happy
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
to circulate it to everyone okay thank
 
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
actually I second the motion is one of
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
three things it's either recommend for
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
further consideration or not recommend
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
for further consideration or no
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation that's the motion what uh
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn read was in effect the um
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
I was going to say blur I I really
 
00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
apologize that the
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
report that's what he read the
 
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
motion is clear we have three motions
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's our choice it's just like we have
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
a motion generally you know to you know
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
ought to pass ought to pass with
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment itl interim study the motion
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
in this case is recommend further action
 
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
and then the explanation is the kind of
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
action we're
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
recommending and no I I agree with that
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
I spoke to I spoke to uh Paul Smith just
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
before we started and and that's you
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
know he said you can you don't have to
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
put in anything further if you don't
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
want to but you can and so I would you
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
know that's why I phrased the motion the
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
way I did yeah I I would agree that you
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
should probably put more in since that's
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
what we voted on right right thank
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
you all right so I'm going to close the
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
hearing then on uh HP 1089 and open the
 
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
16002 um and is there anyone here who
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
um wishes to address that
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none uh do we have any only
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor on this a representative
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
Alexander I think do we have um any any
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
discussion anyone have anything they
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
want to say
 
00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.430 align:start position:0%
want to say
on

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.589 align:start position:0%
on
16002

00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
um again I you know I was I sort of feel
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
that we that we are in somewhat the same
 
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.270 align:start position:0%
that we that we are in somewhat the same
position

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
um if we look narrowly at whether s we
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
there should be some further action on
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
16002 my inclination would be to say no
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
on the other hand um if if we talk more
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
broadly about you know to the extent
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
that this is a an
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh a an issue dealing with housing and
 
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.470 align:start position:0%
uh a an issue dealing with housing and
problems

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
reflecting the housing situation then I
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
would tend to say yeah there is
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
definitely a need for further action in
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
in that area um so represent
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
Smith um thank you as usual Mr chair I
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
agree with you completely that we need
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
to be taking action in the area of
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
housing um in a lot of ways planning
 
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
zoning I hate to use the word but
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
financing lots of things like that I
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
think in terms of this particular bill I
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
would suggest that the
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee recommend no further action on
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
this particular bill that's not saying
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
that there shouldn't be further action
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
in Myriad ways as related to housing but
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not get us closer to
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
the goals that we all
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
share thank you any other other
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
trip I would agree with uh
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh when
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
we make it when we write a report I
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
would I would assume that
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh we repeat what representative Smith
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
said that yes there is a need for
 
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
something to be done about housing but
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh the solution proposed by this bill is
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
not uh recommended by the uh the
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
committee I I like the way you phrase
 
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
that and that's maybe what it even a
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
blind squirrel gets in once in a while
 
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:47.950 align:start position:0%
blind squirrel gets in once in a while
thank

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.390 align:start position:0%
thank

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
um so representative Smith do we have a
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
do you have a motion
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh light of along the lines of what you
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
said uh I I would move as to uh House
 
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.390 align:start position:0%
said uh I I would move as to uh House
Bill

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
1602 that we do not
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
recommend further action on this bill
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
all right is there a
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
second second by representative D
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo any further uh
 
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.829 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
St

00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
St
 
00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
um without being able to really dive
 
00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:12.559 align:start position:0%
into the notes that I made there seem to
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
be a question
 
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
of capability uh if you uh
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
allow greater power to the appeals board
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
and does that create a backlog with any
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
number of issues because of a lack of
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
expertise and certain
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
areas um that's just by cursory
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
superficial review of my notes and so um
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
I would I would agree with the uh non
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation any other comments I
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
guess I I would have to say I mean to
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
some in a very general sense this this
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
the this bill is related to the bill
 
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to discuss next dealing with
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
environmental but I I agree with uh with
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
because um the simply giving as as you
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
pointed out representative St simply
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
giving as this bill would propose to
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
give the housing appeals board authority
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
to review decisions of state agencies
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
having to do with housing um I I just
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see that as really a in
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
any way a uh you know advancing the ball
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh on the whole overall housing issue
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
and I think we saw at the hearing um uh
 
00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
we we began to see some of the problems
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
with it the the uh the Human Rights
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
Commission said well wait a minute you
 
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
can't you know you can't put us in that
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
um the uh we heard I think evidence uh
 
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
about or at least argument about uh the
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board really has no
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
expertise in the environmental area they
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
may have no particular expertise in the
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
area of highways to the extent that that
 
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
impacts um uh housing decisions and so I
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
um I have no doubt of the of the you
 
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
know the
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
uh the the good intentions that the bill
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
was was offered by I tend to think that
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
it just not um it it's not it's not
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
something that we want to pursue further
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
in legislation in that area although we
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
OB obviously will be dealing with the
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
housing matter further um so um any any
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
further comments by anyone on this all
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
right then I'd ask uh the motion is to
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
we recommend no further action and I'd
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
ask the uh clerk to call the role please
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
um so that takes care of uh 16002 the
 
00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
last bill that uh we have to address is
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
House Bill 16 uh
 
00:48:43.599 --> 00:48:45.150 align:start position:0%
House Bill 16 uh
14

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
14
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
um which uh relative to judicial review
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
of Department of Environmental Services
 
00:48:51.119 --> 00:48:52.710 align:start position:0%
of Department of Environmental Services
decisions

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
um and um believe the prime sponsor is
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
here you please if you'd come up and be
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much cherine and
 
00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative Rebecca McWilliams
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
from conquer um you may recall uh we had
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
a robust discussion at our initial
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
hearing about this bill talking about uh
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
Dees and the four uh councils uh and
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
their roles um in reviewing decisions
 
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
um and really I just want to get to the
 
00:49:30.789 --> 00:49:30.799 align:start position:0%
Crux of this bill because I think it's
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
important that everyone understand the
 
00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:34.799 align:start position:0%
goal of this bill is the ability to
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
appeal decisions of either Dees or a
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
council that has ratified a decision by
 
00:49:43.789 --> 00:49:43.799 align:start position:0%
Dees this is not about fixing or
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
adjusting the way that we have councils
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
set up right now in the state and I
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
understand that that is a separate issue
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
and may be taken up separately uh but
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
really the goal here is to have the
 
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
ability to say the nameless faceless
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy made a decision and I am not
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
able to appeal that on scientific
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
grounds and that is unjust so
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
fundamentally that was the goal of this
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
bill um I do want to just note that
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment to this bill that
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
I think made it a lot better um so uh to
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
the extent that there is interest
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
especially bipartisan interest in
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward again next year uh
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment just for the record is
 
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.630 align:start position:0%
the amendment just for the record is
2024

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
0869 um and it was a bipartisan
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh sponsored by man Kenny and
 
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
Alexander uh so I think that there there
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
is opportunity here for justice uh in
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
terms of creating a appeal opportunity
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
for when something is decided and it is
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
unjustly decided and there really is no
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
way to go back and revisit that decision
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
right now with our current system um and
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
just I I do want to reiterate because
 
00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
it's been a while since that initial
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
hearing 35 other states besides New
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have considered and agreed
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
that there should be some kind of an
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
appeal so we are a bit of an outlier as
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
one of the uh 15 states who does not
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
allow some kind of a justice-based
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
appeal for discovering new information
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
and again a lot of our discussion was
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
about pfas and what that means for human
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
health and discovering this after the
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
information has come out after the
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
decision by a council um so again I
 
00:51:22.589 --> 00:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
think that this is an update it's
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
modernization I think it makes sense for
 
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
us to consider this and I do think that
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
um there are some members here who may
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
be interested in bringing forth future
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm glad to discuss
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
further or answer questions on this
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
thank you so much questions for yes
 
00:51:37.079 --> 00:51:44.150 align:start position:0%
thank you so much questions for yes
representative

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
Smith now I don't have a question
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
because I do believe I enthusiastically
 
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
support everything that the prime
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor has just said um I think it is
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
not good government that within one
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
agency there are
 
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.710 align:start position:0%
agency there are
Myriad

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
Myriad
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
procedures um and if you happen to go in
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
door a you have one procedure but door B
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
another um it is impossible for a
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
concerned citizen uh to understand what
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
the process is and know what their
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
rights are and I think it is essential
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
that we um pursue this in uh in the
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
future and would take advantage of uh
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
amendments that have been suggested new
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
information but that if we could figure
 
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
out um an intelligent responsible way to
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
handle Appeals
 
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
we would be making an enormous step
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
forward and what well the next thing I
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
want to say might not be appropriate I'm
 
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
still going to say it we have had the
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
privilege of working with representative
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
MC Williams over a number of years she
 
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
brings to the
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
legislature uh both design architectural
 
00:53:27.789 --> 00:53:27.799 align:start position:0%
and legal expertise that is a rare
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
combination and Incredibly valuable and
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
I would like to say that I for one am
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
going to sorely miss her presence in the
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
you well I I would make a motion that um
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
this uh deserves further uh uh
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
consideration I'll

or detractions to the bill I I
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
just I don't really think that there I I
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm I know that there was
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
a there was a bill that was passed that
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
called for a SE separate bill that
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
called for a
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
study of um the appeals process in
 
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
environmental um uh matters um uh
 
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.230 align:start position:0%
environmental um uh matters um uh
representative

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh Vanessa uh what's it
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
um trying to
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
remember somebody make somebody refresh
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:07.670 align:start position:0%
 
up

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
okay so for the record my name is Rainey
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
peler I'm the Water Division director at
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
Dees and so as you might imagine a lot
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the appeals before the water and the
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
wetlands Council are basically looking
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
at areas of of housing Land Development
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
those types of things what I will say is
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
is that all of the appeals processes
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
whenever a permit is issued or denied it
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
is very clear on each of those documents
 
00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:39.039 align:start position:0%
that in fact what the appropriate appeal
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
process is so let's say that we approved
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
the wetlands permit and and a butter had
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
some issues with that they within 30
 
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
days have their right to appeal and that
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
is clearly spelled out on that document
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
that comes out of our agency so once
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
that process goes forward it gets on a
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
schedule for the particular Council in
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
this case the wetlands Council and in
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
fact they will then go before a hearings
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
officer the appeals processes today are
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
overseen by the Department of Justice
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
and I think Alan Brooks is here he does
 
00:57:21.789 --> 00:57:21.799 align:start position:0%
represent Dees generally so I I will say
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
that um the opinion would be that in
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
fact there is a clear path of how people
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
should move forward in the appeals
 
00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
process I think when we're looking at
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
some of the issues of interjecting the
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
Superior Court versus the Supreme Court
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
years ago that was changed to Supreme
 
00:57:45.789 --> 00:57:45.799 align:start position:0%
Court because people we found out that a
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
lot of people that were their project
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
was being appealed would basically get
 
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
worn down they didn't have the money to
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
deal with the appeal so they just walked
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
walked away so we found that that was
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
not fair that a lot of people that that
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
receed permits from us are just regular
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
General run-of-the-mill people in the
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
public that have a property they want to
 
00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:11.799 align:start position:0%
do something with a lot of them don't
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
have the financial wherewithal to
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
continue to go through many iterative
 
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
processes for for the appeals hence it
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
was changed and went from the councils
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
to Supreme Court and so I guess legally
 
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
as far as any further questions I I'll
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
throw Allen under the
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
bus all right representative Smith thank
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr peler before you throw anyone
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
else under the bus I want to say that
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
you have been doing what you've what
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
you're doing for a very long time in
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
state government and one of the most
 
00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
respected members of state government
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
you're involved now exclusively in terms
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
of water
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
can you tell me the name of the
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
of thank you representative Smith I
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
think we've known each other for a long
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
time just for the record this is my 52
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
year uh with the department so I don't
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
know if that says that I'm not too
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
bright or not but at any rate when I
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
started out was the water supply and
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control Commission to speak to
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
you in 1987
 
00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
that agency went away and it went to the
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
since 87 to the current time we have
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
been the Department of Environmental
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
Services when they created that agency
 
00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
they brought together the wetlands board
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
and the Water Resources board as you
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
know representative Smith and other
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
facets so we went from the early days of
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
just water and wastewater to the whole
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
gamut of envir enironmental issues so I
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
oversee the Water Division which has
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
seven programs in it and I've been doing
 
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
that for a long long time so and and
 
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
um operations for the I don't want to
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
use the word agencies because that means
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
something different what other
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
operations are going on in the
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
Services as far as programs
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative yeah yeah well in the
 
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
Water Division I'm responsible what
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
about other than the Water
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
Division pardon what about other than
 
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
the Water Division we have the waste
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
Division and the Resources Division okay
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
and in Resources Division what are the
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
areas well in the Water Resources well I
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
guess the point that I want to make
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
without dragging it out is that over the
 
01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.430 align:start position:0%
without dragging it out is that over the
year

01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
as we have restructured the agency
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
additional um areas of concern have come
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
in under the aaces of the agency and my
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
understanding Mr pel here and you can
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
tell me if I'm wrong is that each of
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
those different
 
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
areas has its own procedures for
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
handling appeals and so the procedures
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
that you use which I'm sure are
 
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
carefully drawn and responsible may or
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
may not be the same procedures that are
 
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
used in other sections of the department
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
is that correct um respectfully I would
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
say that all three councils the water
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
Council the waste Council and the air
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
Council pretty much have administrative
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
rules that uh are the same thank
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Manos thank you Mr
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr peler for taking my
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
question um I'm wondering whether within
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
the process the council can consider new
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence or New Economic
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
evidence um and in the appet process
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
can um evidence of changing science or
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
changing economics come into it yeah
 
01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I think I'm probably going to
 
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:28.039 align:start position:0%
defer the legal aspects of that but I
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
think when somebody files an appeal it
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
then goes before the council they get on
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
the agenda so each where the dees has a
 
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative there usually is somebody
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and the attorney
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
for the appellant they in fact can come
 
01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:47.559 align:start position:0%
in and if they have something new or
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
they have something that they want to
 
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
liberal other question
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
comments thank you very much sir is is
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes uh to be
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
1614 uh yes representative
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
staple sorry to belabor this but I'm
 
01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
having trouble with this there was there
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
was a lot of stuff contained in this
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill and I just uncovered in one of my
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
notes um a letter from the Department of
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
by um Robert Scott commissioner and I
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
just pulled out one particular paragraph
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
here nhdes is opposed to this bill
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
because it is inconsistent with other
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
provisions of law attempts to set the
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
review of Department decisions and rules
 
01:03:48.269 --> 01:03:48.279 align:start position:0%
apart from the uniform processes and
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
standards applicable to all other their
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
state agencies and adjudicative bodies
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
and is likely to lead to significant
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
additional and unnecessary litigation
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
and Associated resource
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
impacts so my only upshot from that
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
would be to ask if uh the amendment and
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
the work session um U modified or
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
amended any of those concerns or
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
not you know I have to say I honestly as
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
I'm as I'm sitting here now I don't
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
remember I don't
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
my best recollection is if it made any
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
changes to those things that you're
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
talking about it wasn't it it wasn't a
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
lot that's my that's my recollection and
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative MC if I'm wrong on that I
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
think you wanted to me one of the things
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
that I
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
think I and I think Dees had a problem
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
with was the changing of the standard of
 
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
review to the sort of arbitrary and
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
capricious and I don't think that the
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
amendment changed that if am I wrong on
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
that um first I just want to say that
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of this was to choose
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
Dees as a test let's see if we can
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
change the standard here arbitary and
 
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
capricious rather than just legal
 
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
because legal everything's legal for
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
Dees to do so it's impossible to
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
challenge that uh based on their
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority as long as what
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
they're doing is quote unquote legal
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
can't be challenged well that
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
fundamentally means that they're judge
 
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
jury and executioner they have all the
 
01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
power and there's really no way to come
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
back later um the reason we chose just
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
Dees was because to promulgate this
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
across all of the different commissions
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
was going to be huge a huge Endeavor and
 
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh we know that there have been issues
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
with pasas right now that have required
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
more scientific evidence to be brought
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
up with a third party review preferably
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary of New Hampshire and
 
01:05:55.269 --> 01:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
because the standard right now does not
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
include arbitrary and capricious it's
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
not possible to challenge that initial
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
evidence and so unfortunately we're in a
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
situation where our hands are tied
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
because we have given rule making
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
Authority without any other caveats to
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
Dees and now we as a legislature need to
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
look at potentially reigning that in and
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
saying okay is this about human health
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
can we find some other standard so we
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
could adjust the rulemaking authority
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
that is a totally different bill that we
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
could bring in to change it or we could
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
add this additional layer of judicial
 
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
review for arbitrary and capricious
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
standards so there are multiple ways to
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
attack this but in the work session uh
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
to answer that spe specific question
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton asked um that's
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
why Dees was singled out because of the
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
timely concerns and because promulgating
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
this across all agencies was going to be
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
really complicated and then on the other
 
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
hand um in terms of the standard
 
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and capricious is what those
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
35 other states are using so we were
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
following suit with everybody else we
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
didn't change that um and I understand
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
the dees uh commissioner concerns
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
certainly they don't want to be singled
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
out uh but at this time we would need to
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
do some kind of a test balloon to see if
 
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature can allow these appeals
 
01:07:08.109 --> 01:07:08.119 align:start position:0%
and then ideally promulgate that across
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
multiple agencies later once it works so
 
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
really yes Dees has the current and
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
present issue and so that was the reason
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
why is it singling out perhaps but it's
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
also timely um so happy to answer
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
further on that one but I think it's
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
just important to set the record clear
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
that there's sort of a history here as
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
to why it was done on the way it was
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
done um and and big picture I think
 
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
there's probably um some opportunity for
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
us to correct that and and make it right
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
questions hang on one second so all
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much represent I'm
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
sorry someone else wanted to uh be oh
 
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative man thank you
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just wanted to ask you um
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams changing the
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
standard to arbitrary and precious
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't in and of itself solve the
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
problem of the introduction of new
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
scientific or economic evidence is that
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
correct so the challenge that we've been
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
looking at right now is that an agency
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
makes a decision and then it goes to one
 
01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
of these councils for for further review
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
and so whatever the agency has decided
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's arbitrary capricious or not
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
they've already done the scientific
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
level review so we heard in testimony
 
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
when we first brought forth this bill
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
months ago we heard from uh one of the
 
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
chairs of one of the councils that their
 
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
sole role is to review What was decided
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
by Dees and determine whether or not it
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
was in keeping with the statute so the
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
councils are reviewing statute they are
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
not reviewing scientific evidence and so
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
that gives us in the past scenario that
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
gives us no way to challenge inaccurate
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
science scientific analysis at the onset
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
by the agency and so that really is the
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
issue the arbitrary and capricious uh
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
standard gives an ability to take
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
another bite at the Apple later on in
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
the process when you realize wow this
 
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
was the wrong scientific analysis but
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the councils aren't
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
looking at that piece they're they're
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
defending the statute um and I do also
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
want to M mention um there's a similar
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
Bill uh House Bill 1622 that's very
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
similar to this one um in terms of
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
transparency and government uh
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
oversight um and we as a house passed it
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
by Voice vote um it is potentially up
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
for veto override so I just want to put
 
01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
it on everybody's radar um this is about
 
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
refunding uh penalties when it turns out
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
that an agency issued a penalty
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
improperly against someone who was not
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
actually a bad actor and I do think that
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
again as legislators it is our role to
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
ensure fairness and Justice in this sort
 
01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
of a situation so keep an eye on uh
 
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1622 when it comes up as well
 
01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.790 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1622 when it comes up as well
thank

01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:09.149 --> 01:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
um thank you um Mr chair um thank you
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my further question just as
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh to put it into perspective that
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
letter that I quoted from was dated
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
February 13
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
2024 and the amendment
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
0926 was March 4
 
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
2024 um so did the amendment address a
 
01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
number of issues in those letters to
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
satisfaction could you reflect on that
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
if that was so or not uh certainly we
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
looked at all of the letters when
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
putting together this amendment and I
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
feel that it was a balance of what is
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
possible and also the intent of the bill
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
again to give that true appeal
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity based on um the criteria we
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
discussed where there's a scientific
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
decision that was like Incorrect and
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
right now under the current process we
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
don't have a standard that allows that
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
appeal thank
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
you any other comments thank you very
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
much I think there's someone else who
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
up my name's chip Kimble and I'm
 
01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
chairman of the wetlands Council and
 
01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
what I've just heard from representative
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
although it may seem I'm sure she
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
sincere is a
 
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
completely different from what I
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
understand um and what we're actually
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
doing um the misrepresentations seem to
 
01:11:43.709 --> 01:11:43.719 align:start position:0%
be quite numerous first of all we do
 
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
hear new scientific evidence and that
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
does impact our decisions and it's clear
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the statutes which are is 210
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh and also in
 
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
04 and also in 21
 
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
M39 I believe it is which sets up the
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
hearing officer system there was a time
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
in years past quite a long time ago when
 
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
all we did was review the record of Dees
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay now we always have new information
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
because everyone is allowed all the
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
appellants are allowed to bring in new
 
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.830 align:start position:0%
appellants are allowed to bring in new
information

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
the members of all the councils are
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
not employees of
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
Dees we are all separate individuals or
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
representatives of other state agencies
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
such as do or fishing game um state
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
parks different different agencies so we
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
are and we are separate agencies from
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
the es we do have the hearing at the's
 
01:12:58.350 --> 01:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
office because that's the most sensible
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
place to have the hearings obviously our
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
staff which is our appeals staff our
 
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
appeals clerk is works at doj she's a
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
she's a member of doj the hearing
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
officers just recently we have made a
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
big Improvement in as of September the
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of September that we now have
 
01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
a permanent hearing officer who is
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
primary whose primary responsibil ility
 
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
hearings can I just can I just ask is
 
01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
that is that is that hearings
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
officer the the person that handles that
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
is the hearings officer for all of the
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
councils or just all of the all of the
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
councils same person right okay that
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
would be 21
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
M39 okay like that
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
um so that and and go back to the
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and capricious what what we're
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
charged with if you read I believe
 
01:14:01.719 --> 01:14:02.669 align:start position:0%
charged with if you read I believe
that's

01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
21 um
 
01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.070 align:start position:0%
21 um
014

01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
014
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
is unlawful and unreasonable
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay capricious is if you look at the
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
definition there if you go to blacks is
 
01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and then if you look at
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
unreasonable it says capricious so the
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
difference between those two is
 
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
something that we could you know never
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
quite discern what what the difference
 
01:14:29.679 --> 01:14:30.590 align:start position:0%
quite discern what what the difference
would

01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
be the the bill as
 
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
proposed basically bifurcates two things
 
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.709 align:start position:0%
proposed basically bifurcates two things
it

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
takes and sets a standard which roughly
 
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
the only difference is the addition of
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
change arbitrary and capricious and
 
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
apparently you know changes that for
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
some reason it also adds constitutional
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
if it's a violation of constitution well
 
01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
if we ever declared it was a violation
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
of constitution it would go up to
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I mean I can't imagine
 
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't make much sense and if
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
somebody but if you want to have us
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
decide whether it's unconstitutional we
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
could I suppose do that the other thing
 
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
that that section does is it revises how
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
we can assess whether Dees has followed
 
01:15:25.149 --> 01:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
rules or not and instead it takes in set
 
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
a separate process up before the
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court in marac County to assess
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
whether rules that have been set up by
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
dees are arbitrary capricious or simply
 
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
statute whereas now we basically do that
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
so if we see that there's a rule that
 
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
had been in place and we determine that
 
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
it's inconsistent with statute which is
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
something that feels uh an appellant
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
would bring forward then we you know we
 
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
address that and say no you can't do
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
that because it's inconsistent with
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
stat similarly we might find that a rule
 
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
as applied in the particular instance is
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
unreasonable so I guess I'll stop there
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
for the moment there a lot of in a lot
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
of what appeared to me to be statements
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
that just don't quite understand what
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
the current system
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
is represent thank you thank you very
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
much um your comments have been very
 
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
helpful can you uh help me understand in
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
the comments you made the difference
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
between a
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
decision Ru rules are established by the
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
department or by any agency we have our
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
own the councils have their own rules
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
that we establish for how to handle
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
appeals and how to handle the other
 
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
actions before us rules are established
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
by the agency to implement the
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
statutes and then in our case and and I
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
all all the council's case when Dees
 
01:17:14.189 --> 01:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
proposes a rule if they propose it in
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
the wetlands area which is 482a or if
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
they report it say in a water Council
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
area which is other statutes or the air
 
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
area those rules go before that Council
 
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
and the council then reviews and can
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
comment on the rules okay and then Dees
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
has to take into consideration our
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
comments and then of course they go to
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
jail car eventually and are implemented
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
so when we have an appeal we're both
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
looking at the statutes and at the
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
rules to to determine if the actions of
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
Dees were consistent with those and
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
that's based on not just the information
 
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
that thees had at the time they made the
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
decision but it's based on that
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
information plus the information that
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
the appellant brings or interveners
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
bring before us at that time or Dees
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
brings before us at that time the new
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
information so the rules are not the
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
decision the decision
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
is what Dees decided in a
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
particular applic ation or a
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
particular say administrative order for
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
example in won's case someone builds a
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
structure out over the water without
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
Authority from Dees it's a violation of
 
01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.350 align:start position:0%
Authority from Dees it's a violation of
482

01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
482
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
a25 and you have to tear it down go to
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
482 a26 I
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
think so that's the decision that Dees
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
makes they tell those people oh you've
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
got to take that addition down then
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
those people appeal before us and we
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
look to see oh did they make that
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
decision properly did they obey all the
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
rules the appellant might bring forward
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
some you know exculpatory information
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
that they feel you know whatever but
 
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the difference the the
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
decision also would be a permit decision
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
so someone applies for a dock in our
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
case or applies to fill wetlands and
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
then someone complains and a butter
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
complains no you shouldn't do
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
that Dees un you didn't follow a certain
 
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
Rule and if they don't follow the rule
 
01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
then we send it back we remand it to
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
them to correct
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
it thank you other questions
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you Mr chair
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you you testified when we
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
heard the bill initially correct yes and
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
I I believe you testified that your role
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
is to um protect the statute and not to
 
01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
protect the environment is that what
 
01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
your testimony was yes because we are
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the statutes and we're
 
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the rules we we don't have a
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
separate charge to decide that well the
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
statute isn't very good we ought to
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
change it for for example okay we had an
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
appeal somewhat
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
recently where it was evolved an
 
01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.390 align:start position:0%
recently where it was evolved an
existing

01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
Dam one of the things in fact the only
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
thing for the appellants that came up
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
was that it really would have been good
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
if Dees had reviewed fish populations
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
there wasn't in our opinion any legal or
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
rural requirement that they do that the
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
dam was already there and they were just
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
modifying the outlet okay so it might be
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
a great idea and we did say that's a
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
good idea you you need to change it or
 
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
you need to change the statute or need
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
to change a rule but we can't impose
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
our scientific knowledge if you will our
 
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.669 align:start position:0%
our scientific knowledge if you will our
our

01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
opinions over what the statutes or the
 
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.189 align:start position:0%
opinions over what the statutes or the
rules

01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
say B may may I follow up yes no um the
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
statute says does it not that Dees shall
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
make rules in these areas is that
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
correct right and so that doesn't put
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
any constraints at all all on or very
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
little constra effectively no
 
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
constraints on the rules that Dees
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
promulgates is I would I would disagree
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
with that because the rules that they
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
promulgate have to be based on a statute
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
on the detailed statute if you're
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the simple purpose of say
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
a wetland statute or any of the other
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
statutes I I mean we're often a never
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
Neverland at that at that point um to me
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
um in the quest in the case that you
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
just described of the dam um you said
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
that that you're able to consider new
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence so I'm confused
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
about in the example you gave of for
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
example why there wasn't evidence about
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
fish populations there was a lot of
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
evidence about fish populations and
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
discussions about whether eels actually
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
made it up for example to this
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
particular location or what fish were
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
there there
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
and whether
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
Dees actually looked at the fish
 
01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.950 align:start position:0%
Dees actually looked at the fish
issue

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
enough but that and that was there were
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of other things that were brought
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
up and that how this affected water
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
quality how it might affected someone
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
else's Wells how it
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
affected um the vegetation for example
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
that was that was growing there um and
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
that was evidence that had not come in
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
before Oh that right and proposals that
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
did not come in before right and the
 
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
other question I wanted to ask you is I
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
have a memory um I don't remember
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
whether it was you or somebody else who
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
testified about there being many
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
openings on these councils and that
 
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
their volunteer positions and that many
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
of them are open I think there was
 
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who was oriented around health
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
issues for example where that position
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
was open that's in the waste Council
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
think but there at this point fact we
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
were just going over but I don't know
 
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
how many openings we have left but in
 
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
the terms of the total councils I'm only
 
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
in charge of the wetlands but we have
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
one opening although I just found out
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
that we have one member who just
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
resigned so that would give two openings
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
out of 12 um the other councils uh
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
they've been doing a a good job trying
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
to improve that so they get you know
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
their their staffed up but we do have
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
anyway that's that's the openings and do
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
those openings affect your ability to
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
area um in our case no I don't know that
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh openings in the others I'm not sure
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
that they that they would I suppose if
 
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
you had a lot of openings so it might uh
 
01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
but you have to remember that in in any
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
of these all of these councils all of
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
the members there are
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
scientific the vast majority of the
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
members there are scientifically
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
oriented or engineering oriented so for
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
them to accept and we're always
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
accepting testimony from various experts
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
the the case I happen to mention earlier
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
we had four different experts for the um
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
appellants maybe more maybe five
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
so I think many of us and in fact uh in
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
that case we had some serious problems
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
with some of the expert testimony and it
 
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
was easy for several of us to see that
 
01:25:12.109 --> 01:25:12.119 align:start position:0%
for example in that case if you have
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
data for four locations or five six
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
locations excuse me and then you only
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
use it for part of those locations and
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
part of those dates that you've
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
manipulated your data whether or not
 
01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.550 align:start position:0%
manipulated your data whether or not
were

01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
scientifically astute on the particular
 
01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.030 align:start position:0%
scientifically astute on the particular
data

01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
but um and finally I wanted to ask about
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
um the the arbitrary and capricious
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
standard and I I just wanted to ask you
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit because you said there um
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
well uh 3 I think it was 34 other states
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
use the arbitrary and capricious
 
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
standard and I'm just curious um that
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be effective in other states
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering what your hesitation
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
is about that
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
standard I'm not sure that it's any
 
01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
difference you you don't gain anything
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
by by changing it except more litigation
 
01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
over what happened when you change it to
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
me I mean it it I when that came B when
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
the bill came out I went to blacks and I
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
looked it up and I went back and forth
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
and then I went to multiple dictionaries
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
and went back and forth and you're just
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
chasing yourself around in a circle so
 
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
that's you know I don't I don't see the
 
01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:24.590 align:start position:0%
that's you know I don't I don't see the
gain

01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
gain
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions for this
 
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
up yeah yeah yeah now it's joh my name
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
is Alan Brooks uh I'm chief of the
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Bureau at the
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice I appear before
 
01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
the councils next to me is Mark delforno
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
who represents the councils um we our
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
office does not take a position on
 
01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
anything that you're going to do today I
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
thought it just might be helpful to
 
01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that have
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
come up with respect to evidence uh all
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
of the hearings are now evidentiary
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
hearings 15 years ago that was not the
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
case there were record-based appeals um
 
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
and evidence is always admitted to give
 
01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:31.719 align:start position:0%
you an example from the wetlands Council
 
01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
just because the chair happens to be
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
here rule 20316 says evidence shall be
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
admitted unless excluded by the
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
presiding officer for being repetitious
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
irrelevant or highly privileged uh
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
legally privileged so it's common to get
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
new evidence uh I had a hearing before
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
the air Resources Council the issue was
 
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
um eversource at the marac station had
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
been using what's called traditional
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
coal the agency had discretion to
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
determine what was traditional coal and
 
01:28:07.629 --> 01:28:07.639 align:start position:0%
the issue was what the sulur content was
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
of coal the agency made its factual
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
determination it's scientific
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
determination about what the self for
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
content of traditional coal should be
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
PSNH at the time challenged that and
 
01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:19.639 align:start position:0%
said it should be something different
 
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
and we had probably a two-day hearing
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
with experts on both sides saying what
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
it should be and the air Council
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
overturned the department decision
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
factually saying their decision was
 
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
unreasonable in that respect so evidence
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
is taken in we do hear from experts um
 
01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
regard the standard in
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
210 is that a decision of the agency can
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
be overturned if it's either
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
unreasonable or unlawful and that is
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
further Broken Out In 21m so that if
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's purely a legal issue if all people
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
are saying is it violates the statute or
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
rule on its face purely legal issue that
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
is a decision of the hearing officer if
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's a factual determination that
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
something is factually unreasonable the
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
decision is unreasonable based on the
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
facts that is the only decision that
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
goes to the members of the council so
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
it's like a judge and a jury if you're
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with that scheme so the judge
 
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
decides the legal issues the council
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
decides the factual issues but they do
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
decide those issues and they do overturn
 
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
the department if they think that it was
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
unreasonable the the standard for
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
unreasonableness is as far as I can tell
 
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
and the chair has stated exactly the
 
01:29:32.109 --> 01:29:32.119 align:start position:0%
same as arbitrary and capricious in fact
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
one of the rule sets at least used to
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
say unreasonable means arbitrary and
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
compres so I don't think there is
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
actually a difference with respect to
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
that standard I'm certainly not opposed
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
to that standard I think that is the the
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
standard though that is used um and with
 
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
respect to the rules there are numerous
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
cases that have determined that Dees can
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
fill in the blanks all agents gencies
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
can fill in the blanks in the statute
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
and can add detail but they can't go
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
outside the parameters of what the
 
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
statute allows them to do so they can't
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
make any rule they can kind of fill in
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
the spaces in between so that's my
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
understanding in the process I don't
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
know if um attorney delforno has
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
anything he'd like to add I have nothing
 
01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.189 align:start position:0%
anything he'd like to add I have nothing
to

01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
add questions yes representative
 
01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
come thank you Mr chairman uh you
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned 15 years uh ago you know that
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
the hearing uh I don't want to go 15
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
years but last few years are you having
 
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
more hearing than you know every year
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
you getting more and more
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
hearings I'd say I I don't know that
 
01:30:39.109 --> 01:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
we've seen an uptick in the number of
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
hearings that's really unusual um some
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
councils get more hearings than others
 
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
the air Council gets very few the waste
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
division gets some the wetlands Council
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
gets a lot um and so with more
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
development you'll see more hearings
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
before the waste Council the other
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
councils I don't think I've seen any
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
increase followup Mr chairman yes so
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh you you said that you're not taking
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
any any any side you know you know but
 
01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
do you think that system is
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
working well that's a great question and
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
I think that um we're always looking to
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
have uh the processes be better
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
especially again I appear before the
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
councils so if there's a frustration I
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
feel that frustration because I have to
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
either wait for a decision or I can't do
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
something I wanted to do so but is it
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
working the there were committees and
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
legislation um a few years ago to change
 
01:31:35.629 --> 01:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
the way the councils worked in a pretty
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
substantial way to make it better the
 
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
problem has been since that
 
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
time that all right there's a new
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
system the hearing officer that was
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
there retired my understanding and
 
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
attorney delforno maybe can tell you
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
better that is the Department of Justice
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
had a lot of trouble finding a qualified
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
attorney to actually be a hearing
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
officer that slowed things down the
 
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
decision eventually was made to use a
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
number number of people in house to
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
handle the hearings but nobody had in
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
their you know job description the
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
ability to accept all of the council
 
01:32:13.709 --> 01:32:13.719 align:start position:0%
work because there's so much of it so
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
one person would be assigned to one case
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
another person to another case another
 
01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
person to another case and I think most
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
recently it was determined that that was
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
inefficient as well and so for the first
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
time just either a few weeks ago or
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
maybe a month ago one person at
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
department of justice has been
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
designated to be the hearing officer
 
01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
along with that the longtime clerk Paula
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
Scott for the councils who brought a lot
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
of experience she went to Personnel
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
appeals board her supervisor Pam Monro
 
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
retired and the position was moved to
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
doj so there's no institutional
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
knowledge there that person has taken
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
some time to get up to speed so I think
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
that it is working but we won't know
 
01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
until it's working until we now get the
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
next subset of information and we see
 
01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
from this point forward okay everything
 
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
is now for the first time in place
 
01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
should be functioning is it actually
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to work the way it's supposed to
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
work other questions representative
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair um after a
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
decision is reached if the uh affected
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
party wants to appeal that decision to
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
whom is that appeal
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
made that's a good question so
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
Department the agency makes a decision
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
that appeal is to the council when the
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
council renders it decis its decision
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
that person can ask the council for
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
reconsideration if the Council made a
 
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
mistake or an error if that is denied
 
01:33:41.229 --> 01:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
the person appeals directly to the
 
01:33:41.239 --> 01:33:44.030 align:start position:0%
the person appeals directly to the
Supreme

01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.109 --> 01:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
Court and if I could follow up and
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's the same whether the appeal is
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
concerned with the law or with the facts
 
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.510 align:start position:0%
concerned with the law or with the facts
correct

01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
thank you if I could ask one more
 
01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.470 align:start position:0%
thank you if I could ask one more
question

01:33:59.470 --> 01:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
um I think you were very sensitive in in
 
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
talking about uh the problems that you
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
have with Staffing making sure that
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
people have the background and the
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
experience that that they need um as
 
01:34:20.109 --> 01:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
these positions are moved from the
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services Department to
 
01:34:26.719 --> 01:34:29.709 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services Department to
Justice

01:34:29.709 --> 01:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
um is that likely to make it more or
 
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
less likely that um the people involved
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
will have the specific knowledge they
 
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
need I think that it will make it much
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
more likely that the people have the
 
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
legal expertise that they need and the
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
the factual expertise usually comes from
 
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
the council members who have been doing
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
that for a long time because those are
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
the factual issues so my hope is that
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
the expertise will be there it will move
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
forward I think it has gone slow over
 
01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
the last year or since the change was
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
made um and again I appear before the
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
councils and so I express my frustration
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
to the councils when things don't move
 
01:35:13.629 --> 01:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
forward and I've done that um several
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
times in motions saying can we move an
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
issue forward or can we dispose of an
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
issue thank you i' be permitted one more
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you is there um
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
a backup at all in terms of pending
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
cases or are you able to follow the uh
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
requirements there's no specific
 
01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
requirement on when the council has to
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
hear a case but I would say that again
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
things have been going slowly for a
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
while because of the changes that I
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
described and I am definitely seeing an
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
uptick in activity in hearing officers
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
issuing decisions on motions to dismiss
 
01:35:56.109 --> 01:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
summary judgment and setting hearing
 
01:35:59.709 --> 01:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
dates within really the last two months
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's been very substantial increase in
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
moving cases forward that hadn't
 
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
happened in the months prior thank
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
you representative Manos thank you thank
 
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um do you
 
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
practice before the four different
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
councils yes and are the processes uh
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
within the four different councils the P
 
01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:25.229 align:start position:0%
within the four different councils the P
processes

01:36:25.229 --> 01:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
processes
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
different they're essentially the same
 
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
so with respect to the information that
 
01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:32.679 align:start position:0%
goes out to people on how to appeal I
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
actually can't remember if the permits
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
themselves put the information but a
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
Deni permit denial I believe has it and
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
I know that the administrative orders
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
all have it for all the programs so the
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
programs and I think I can't remember if
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
it was um you representative Smith who
 
01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
asked about it the big divisions at dees
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
are air water and waste water goes to
 
01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
two separate councils depending on your
 
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
issue either Wetlands or Water waste has
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
a Council air has a council and Dees has
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
what's called cross program rules for
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
all the councils and those are the
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
default rules each Council then has its
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
own set of rules that are a little bit
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
more specific but they're not you know
 
01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
they don't change the cross program
 
01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
rules they're not terribly detailed
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
they're not terribly long they add some
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
fine points to it but essentially the
 
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
process is the is very very similar if
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
not the
 
01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.030 align:start position:0%
not the
same

01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
yes um the openings on the different
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
councils what what is your experience
 
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
with that and where are their openings
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
and do they tend to be
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
um what what representation tends to be
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
missing from from the
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
openings yes thank you for that question
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's an important
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
point when people are on a council and
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the chair can speak to this but
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to perform a very very
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
lengthy detailed task and not get
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
anything back for it so it's very hard
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
to find professionals who are willing to
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
take that much time and because they are
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearings and not record
 
01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.950 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearings and not record
based

01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
based
 
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
appeals most appeals will take more than
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
a day they'll take one or two days and
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
some of them take four or five and so
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
those people have to do that and I think
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find a professional who's
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
qualified who wants to set aside time to
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
do that it's even hard sometimes for the
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
agencies to appoint people who will
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
actually be able to um take people off
 
01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
their job and come and do the very good
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
work that the councils do the important
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
work that the councils do but it's not
 
01:38:37.229 --> 01:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
an easy lift for the people who were
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
there so where do there tend to be
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
openings and does it tend to be on the
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
on the consumer side or the health side
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
um could you talk a little bit about
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
that I don't have a list of current
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
openings right now so I'm I apologize I
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
wish that that I did know um and I don't
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
know if there's a pattern in that I've
 
01:39:01.229 --> 01:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
seen it both from industry from private
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
um from the private sector and from the
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
state agencies all having problems
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
another sure thank you um it sounds like
 
01:39:17.589 --> 01:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
to me based on your experience that this
 
01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:20.679 align:start position:0%
is an area that um the legislature
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
should consider further um
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
you're intimately familiar with these
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
procedures and these processes and it
 
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's sounding to me from what
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
you're saying that this is an area that
 
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
we should really give further
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
consideration to and I'm wondering what
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that are um and um yeah
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
i' I'd like to know your thoughts on
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
that uh again thank you for that
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
question um and again to be specific
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice does not take a
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
position on anything that you're going
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
to do my personal opinion is that I
 
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
think it's time to wait and see if the
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
now fully fledged process is going to
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
operate and I think that's what we're
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
all waiting for is to see okay now that
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
everything is in place is the relatively
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
new scheme that was adopted a few years
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
ago going to work
 
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
properly other questions for this
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
witness so I guess I I have two
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
questions the first question is before a
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
case gets to one of the
 
01:40:23.790 --> 01:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
councils is there a hearing process
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
before Dees other words if somebody if I
 
01:40:29.709 --> 01:40:29.719 align:start position:0%
want to put a you know I want to put a
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh dock on uh my property um uh and
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
somebody objects or Dees thinks that you
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
know I'm I haven't met the requirements
 
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
do I get a hearing before Dees or will
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
they just make a decision without a
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
hearing there is no hearing at the
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
agency sometimes they hold public
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
hearing ings on various permit requests
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
but there's no you don't as a permit
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
applicant let's say you don't get a
 
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
hearing before the agency but it's not a
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
cold process there are pre-application
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
meetings you can have meetings during
 
01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
the application process you can have
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
exchanges of information and the idea of
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
that is so that you don't waste time on
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
an appeal when something could have been
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
resolved at the agency so those
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
processes are there there's one
 
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
additional process related to permits
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
not administrative orders which is the
 
01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
statute allows a preliminary notice of
 
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
appeal so without filing a full-fledged
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
notice saying here are all the issues
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'm appealing you can file a preliminary
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
notice and say Here's what I'm looking
 
01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:32.679 align:start position:0%
at can we enter into settlement
 
01:41:34.350 --> 01:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
discussions with the agency and the
 
01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
agency's then put on notice they'll
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
review it and decide whether or not they
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
want to have settlement discussions on
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
there before it ever gets to it even a
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
preh Heering conference second question
 
01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
I have is if the legislature were
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
inclined to
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
create something akin to the housing
 
01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
appeals board but for envir all
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
environmental appeals other words to
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
sort of um replace the councils and I
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
don't mean replace them in terms of all
 
01:42:03.149 --> 01:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
they do because I understand they do a
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
lot of things other than deciding
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
appeals but if the legislature were to
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
decide in terms of the
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
Appellate role of the councils we're
 
01:42:15.589 --> 01:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
going to take that away from them and
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
create a
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
new you know environmental appeals board
 
01:42:23.550 --> 01:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
um with three members or five members or
 
01:42:26.430 --> 01:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
what whatever would there be enough
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
work in the whole environmental appeals
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
process from all the you know what are
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
now the four councils to to to keep that
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
board you know busy on a full-time
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
basis I'd have to go back and look at
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
the numbers my guess is that it's a
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
full-time job if you did all four
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
environmental council did all of the
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
appeals that that will be a full-time
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
whether you're the hearing officer or a
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
member that will be a full-time job okay
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
and do you have any view on that I mean
 
01:42:56.830 --> 01:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
suppose that the legislature we say
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're creating the environmental appeals
 
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
board it'll have three members one will
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
be a lawyer one will be an
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
environmental engineer and I don't know
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
one will be a you know or maybe one will
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
be a you know an environmental engineer
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
coming from industry and another will be
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
an environmental engineer coming from
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
the environmental movement or something
 
01:43:19.709 --> 01:43:19.719 align:start position:0%
like that what would your view be on
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
that it's a policy decision I think the
 
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
councils were broken up in the way that
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
they are because they repeatedly see
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
issues that are very distinct from each
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
other and have very different technical
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
background so Wetlands will hear you'll
 
01:43:35.229 --> 01:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
have people on the board who uh used to
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
be dock installers let's say and people
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
on the board who are into conservation
 
01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
and wetlands conservation you know to be
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
the other side fish and game will sit on
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
those because they might have a wildlife
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know interest and what's going on
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
very different from let's say the air
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
Resources Council where you're talking
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
about uh air emissions from Power
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
people with the background in chemistry
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
are probably needed for that people who
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
understand the very complicated um
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
because we implement the um Federal
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
program Clean Air Act Title Five permits
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
and the very complicated air issues same
 
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
with the waste division now we have an
 
01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
overlay of cira and Superfund and
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
different issues that are associated
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
with uh with that so it's a policy
 
01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
decision whether the legislature thinks
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
it can train one board to do all those
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
but I think the policy decision was made
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
years ago to say let's let people focus
 
01:44:26.589 --> 01:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
so that we can choose people with
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
expertise in those very specific Fields
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you other
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent Wallace thank
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
you um you've talked about these uh
 
01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
different uh commissions within Dees but
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
one that hasn't been mentioned and is uh
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
involved in almost every permitting
 
01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
application is the uh Heritage and
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
cultural commission who handles appeals
 
01:44:50.430 --> 01:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
of of that to that
 
01:44:52.589 --> 01:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
board thank you that's a good question
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's the Heritage Bureau is not housed
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
within Dees as far as I know they're a
 
01:44:58.589 --> 01:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
separate um they're separate in a
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
separate agency they may be in dncr
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're in dncr okay so they're in dncr
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
right now the Department of Natural and
 
01:45:04.239 --> 01:45:05.109 align:start position:0%
right now the Department of Natural and
cultural

01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
resources and um it's a requirement for
 
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
many of these that you ask the Heritage
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
Bureau okay is there a hit for for a
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
species or or something in there but DS
 
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't control that and if they make a
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
decision one way or
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
another it's not um I don't know of what
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
the appeal process is for the Heritage
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau or if there is or if one exists I
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
I really don't know it's a good question
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
and just to so people understand what
 
01:45:34.589 --> 01:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
happens is as an applicant you ask the
 
01:45:35.950 --> 01:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
Heritage Bureau you get a letter back
 
01:45:38.109 --> 01:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
that says yes there is a hit or no there
 
01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:39.639 align:start position:0%
isn't a hit and that's I think the
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
decision that you're talking about right
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
correct and I do not know what the
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
appeal process would be for that well
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's been my experience every time I've
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
gone for any type of a Shoreland
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
application or anything like that every
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
single time you have to get that uh dncr
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
go or noo fortunately they've all been
 
01:45:58.589 --> 01:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
in my favor but I can imagine that that
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
would be a very difficult hurdle to
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
overcome should you uh encounter one of
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
those would you agree with
 
01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
that yeah I mean to some extent um I
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
suppose you could raise the issues at
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
the council in the context of the permit
 
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
that you've applied
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
for and I would have to check with
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
Heritage about how they do it I don't
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
know if there's some discretion that
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
they use or they just maintain the
 
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
public database that says here's where
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
we know threatened and dangerous PES are
 
01:46:26.669 --> 01:46:26.679 align:start position:0%
or are not your property is one where
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
there's a hit on the list or it's not a
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
hit on the list so I'm not sure there's
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
other than reading the database I'm not
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
sure they do much more than that but
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
again I don't know what the appeal would
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
be from that decision thank you I just
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask that because that's
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely part of the application
 
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
process and if we're trying to address
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
the appell process um it needs to be
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
considered yes for wetland and shorland
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is part of that process I'm not
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
sure it is for um some of the other
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
programs thank you other questions
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
all right see done thank you very much
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
um so I guess um I'm not sure if you
 
01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
made uh yes okay so we have uh a motion
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
to recommend for further legislative
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
action um move by representative Smith
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
second by representative Wallace any
 
01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:13.870 align:start position:0%
second by representative Wallace any
further

01:47:13.870 --> 01:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:15.550 align:start position:0%
further
discussion

01:47:15.550 --> 01:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:47:19.229 --> 01:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
um yes representative
 
01:47:25.709 --> 01:47:25.719 align:start position:0%
trip uh I know previously had uh uh made
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations for uh further action is
 
01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
there a difference between further
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
consideration represent Smith I'm gonna
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
ask you our options are recommend or not
 
01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
recommend oh that's it yeah okay oh no
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
no recommendation right no recation
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so um anybody else
 
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
have any comments so I guess what I
 
01:48:01.589 --> 01:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
would say is I you know I think it it
 
01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:05.239 align:start position:0%
seems to me clear that this ought to be
 
01:48:08.109 --> 01:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
the subject of some further um
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
legislative consideration exactly what
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
that should be whether you know whether
 
01:48:16.589 --> 01:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
I mean it might be it seems to me it
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
might be to do exactly what the last
 
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
witness just suggested is they have a
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
new system in place let's let that
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
circulate see how it works that might be
 
01:48:27.629 --> 01:48:27.639 align:start position:0%
what a future legislature decides or
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
they might decide to have some kind of a
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
establish some kind of a new board um or
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
um they might want to fool around with
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
the standard of review although I have
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
to say as reason I stepped away from the
 
01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
desk for a minute I I went you know I
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
went back to the standard of review it
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me whether it's in
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
21 uh the 21 section for the Department
 
01:48:55.589 --> 01:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
of for the environmental Bureau or the
 
01:48:58.109 --> 01:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
the the basic overall standard of appeal
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
that applies in the Supreme Court it
 
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%
seems to me that U Mr Kimble really is
 
01:49:06.189 --> 01:49:06.199 align:start position:0%
correct I the wording may be it doesn't
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
use the words arbitrary and capricious
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me the standard that
 
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
applies uh is um uh whether or not the
 
01:49:19.629 --> 01:49:19.639 align:start position:0%
decision is not only unlawful but
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
unreasonable um and
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh or or I'm sorry I should say unjust
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
or unreasonable and seems to me that um
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
it it although the it really is a kind
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
of a semantic difference because if
 
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
something is um of uh clearly
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
unreasonable or unjust um it's probably
 
01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and capricious that's another
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
way of uh phrasing it um and so I don't
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
know that that makes any difference but
 
01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
at any rate that's again may be
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
something to be looked that in a future
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
time I have very good news for you Mr
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
chairman all we have to do is
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
say yes it divert you know further or no
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
further and it is the next legislature
 
01:50:15.629 --> 01:50:15.639 align:start position:0%
that then has to worry about it so some
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
of us may be in the next legislature
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
some of us won't be
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
but we don't have to worry about a thing
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
now oh that's exactly right all right
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
any further comments representative
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair
 
01:50:34.350 --> 01:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
um boy there's a lot of spaghetti
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of sauce on this spaghetti
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
and uh I I just the words that it's been
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
working better in the last couple of
 
01:50:47.790 --> 01:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
months um and like to see where it's
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
go implying that there's Improvement in
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
the works
 
01:50:56.069 --> 01:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
um it ain't perfect but it ain't broke
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
do we really want to fix it and that's
 
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
not our job as representative Smith
 
01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
points out so I'm I'm kind of like want
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
to back off of this and do a non-
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
reccommend um and let's let the people
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
who deal with this stuff on a daily
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
basis bring forth their news as well as
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
their concerns and recommendations uh to
 
01:51:21.069 --> 01:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
the Future
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
legislature okay are
 
01:51:23.159 --> 01:51:25.950 align:start position:0%
legislature okay are
other

01:51:25.950 --> 01:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.069 --> 01:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
comments all right um I I appreciate
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
what you say representative Stapleton I
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
I guess I think that um my sense is that
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
there's uh you know that there's enough
 
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
here that we would want at least to look
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
at it further I mean it may it may be as
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
I say I a future legislature might well
 
01:51:46.990 --> 01:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
decide well maybe we're not going to do
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
it next year we'll wait a couple of
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
years or whatever but I I I would say
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
that you know it would be appropriate
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
for a future legisl to at least um
 
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
consider that that matter so I would say
 
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
you know I would be in favor of of
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
recommending further further
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
action all right um I guess anybody else
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
have anything to say yes representative
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
Khan one last thing Mr chairman because
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
I was not in a public hearing on this is
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
my first day of this subject so anybody
 
01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
can tell me that when this kind of
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
subject was reviewed by the legislator
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
you know the last
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
time when was this was reviewed or you
 
01:52:31.709 --> 01:52:31.719 align:start position:0%
know any legisl was done last time to
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
further improve the uh Apple
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
system you know I don't have an exact
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
date but my understanding was it wasn't
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
all that long ago that the system that
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
was described by the two witnesses from
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
doj it wasn't all that long ago that
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
that system was implemented I'm I don't
 
01:52:52.069 --> 01:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
remember when that legislation was but
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
maybe do you have a can you tell me when
 
01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:06.430 align:start position:0%
maybe do you have a can you tell me when
that

01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
happened okay all right thank you
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace thank you and I
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
might just point out for everybody
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
present that the dees is now going
 
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
through the required statutorily that is
 
01:53:18.069 --> 01:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
desial rewrite of all their
 
01:53:19.709 --> 01:53:19.719 align:start position:0%
administrative rules is that not correct
 
01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:38.840 --> 01:54:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
correct

01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
correct and it shouldn't be after the
 
01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.229 --> 01:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
decision all right representative stap
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
just for clarification the motion is to
