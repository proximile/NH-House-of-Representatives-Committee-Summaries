00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:17.959 align:start position:0%
seeing that it is uh 12:30 I will open
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
our Committee hearing this is uh
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
executive session on the four interim
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
study bills that we had um proper
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
motions for these will be either uh to
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation or to not
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
recommend future
 
00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
legislation um I'm going to actually
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
open the floor for a little discussion
 
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
sort of like a mini work session before
 
00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
we get into the Motions on these um and
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
I'll start out that discussion by saying
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
that we did do a full study with the air
 
00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
rifles for hunting game bill which is
 
00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:56.839 align:start position:0%
the first on the list 1024 we actually
 
00:09:59.550 --> 00:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
had a work session over the summer over
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
at Sig with a bunch of committee members
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh the department of fishing game and
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners from fishing game and
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
they all recommended uh the commission
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
and and the department recommended that
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
we pursue future legislation with their
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines and so that that legislation
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
has been submitted and I would request
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
kindly that the committee say that that
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
one should be found as recommended for
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
future legislation because both the
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
commission and the department are
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
interested in that um and then I will
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
open it up to anybody else who has wants
 
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
to discuss any of the bills that are in
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
front of us um before we get started on
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
the executive session part of it does
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
anybody have anything to say about any
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
of these uh these bills that are
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
about okay I will add um one more bit
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
that I had in my notes
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
from 1530 FN require in Fish and Game
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
officers to wear body cameras uh there
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
was discussion from the Department on
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
that that if we were to pursue future
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
legislation it must be framed to have
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
funding given to the department to cover
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
the costs of all those and to have the
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
the uh law enforcement division of the
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
department draw a policy based on other
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
departments using body cameras so that
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's a clear policy in place as well
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
and I think that the first bill was
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
missing that kind of information so if
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
we are to recommend future legislation
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
for that we should make it clear that
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
the future legislation should include
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
funding and um and a a framework of of
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
policy um and given that it might be a
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
tough budget year it may not go anywhere
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
through Finance but that funding would
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
need to be a critical part of the
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
bill um and if there's nothing from
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else I'll open the floor to some
 
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
motions but um actually let's go around
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
and introduce each other because we've
 
00:11:58.829 --> 00:11:58.839 align:start position:0%
got a new clerk we've got a sub so if
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
you'd like go down and do your names so
 
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
that he can get the names right for the
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
the roll calling and all that to make it
 
00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:26.069 align:start position:0%

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
went to
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
um ex just explain the process to me a
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
um either
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
way future legislation can come back
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you absolutely what we
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
do here today is just a a result of our
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
interim studies Andor discussions that
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
we've had amongst the committee and um
 
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
does not reflect on what somebody could
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
put in for future legislation because we
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
cannot bind a future legislation
 
00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:32.839 align:start position:0%
legislature by our decision here so I'm
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
just confused about
 
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
um why do we even vote but that's okay
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
it's a technicality
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay in my view in my view it's in my
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
view it's ceremonially only in a waste
 
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.749 align:start position:0%
view it's ceremonially only in a waste
of

00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
time I I that's what I was thinking but
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to say it out loud but
 
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:52.670 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to say it out loud but
thank

role representative Harvey made the
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
you one thing I will point out while
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
he's getting ready for the role is that
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
we are supposed to write a little blurb
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
if we made the motion on the thing to go
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:38.919 align:start position:0%

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
somebody else for help in writing that
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
we just need to turn a blur bin with
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
this that says this is why we recommend
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
it future legislation
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
that um it needs to be finished by the
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
end of the month so if you if you gave

pass that will go on our report
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
reflected as future legislation is
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
recommended and final bill for the day
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh 1532 relative to the landowner rights
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities pertaining to game
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
cameras and tree stands this was the
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
bill that just allowed a land owner to
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
remove the game camera or tree stand
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
instead of requiring that the landowner
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
contact fishing game or law enforcement
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
to remove the game camera or tree stand
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
in the instances where they might just
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
be a neighbor they didn't want to get
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
involved with the law enforcement Etc
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
but um there was a lot of confusion as
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
to whether that was legal and all this
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
other stuff so the more investigation
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be done at the drafting stage
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
if legislation were to be recommended
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
um current law says that you you're as a
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
land owner if somebody puts a camera or
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
tree stand without your permission that
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
you have to contact law enforcement or
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
fishing game to have it removed by
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
them okay uh any discussion on or do I
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
have a motion on this one I I'll make
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
