amendment

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it seems that the one
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
sticking issue and i believe there's
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
just one
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
omission or we took the word use out
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
we tried to walk a very very fine line
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
with this particular bill
 
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.909 align:start position:0%
with this particular bill
um

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
we support
 
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.310 align:start position:0%
we support
uh

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
the second amendment
 
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
and the right of an individual to
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
bear arms and we felt that when we were
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
talking about public property
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
no matter what the individual has the
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms on public property i
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
think schools are exempt because of
 
00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
but there should be nothing in place to
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
stop you
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
from carrying
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
or bearing arms if you are on public
 
00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.150 align:start position:0%
or bearing arms if you are on public
property

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
i think where
 
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.710 align:start position:0%
i think where
we

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
ran into problems concern
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
the use of those guns on public property
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
that we recognize that municipalities
 
00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.510 align:start position:0%
that we recognize that municipalities
have

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
control over public property
 
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
and in many
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
towns and communities around the state
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
they have said that
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
you can't use those guns on public
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
property and we're talking about parks
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
we're talking about walking trails and
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
other things that are open to the public
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
i can
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
tell you that there have been instances
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
in my community
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
where people have been on public
 
00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.110 align:start position:0%
where people have been on public
property

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
um using shooting their guns and in one
 
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
instance it went through the window of a
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
business cafeteria
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
just irresponsible and because of that
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
the town of londonderry banned the use
 
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.029 align:start position:0%
the town of londonderry banned the use
of

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.070 align:start position:0%
of
guns

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
guns
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
on the in the musquash which is a
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
town-owned property
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
i see the tension here
 
00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.230 align:start position:0%
i see the tension here
between

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
the right to bear arms and the right to
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
use arms and we do tend to regulate the
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
use of those
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
arms where they can use them and where
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
so the senate
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
addressed the
 
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.629 align:start position:0%
addressed the
uh

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
the use of the weapon not whether or not
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
you can bear the weapon
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
um you have every right to do that
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
just the same
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
what senator carson just said i did not
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
see where it was necessary to have the
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
word use in there so i was fine with
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
removing it
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
the lawful use for protection would be
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
already guaranteed under law and
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
the recreational use
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
would um
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
if i can mr chair we felt that
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's stand your ground law
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
was key that if you were on public
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
property and you were attacked or you
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
came to the defense of another that new
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire stand your ground would cover
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
that individual for using
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
the gun at that particular time so we
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
felt we did not feel the need to address
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative bert do you wish to
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman
 
00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:34.949 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman
um

00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
the last time i looked uh you know
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
shooting anybody's window out is against
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
so i would assume that person hopefully
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
was prosecuted
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
i know the hillsborough county behind
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
the hillsborough county nursing home
 
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.430 align:start position:0%
the hillsborough county nursing home
is

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
public land
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
and there is a you know people go up
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
there and shoot in the woods
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
you hear it all the time you know i hear
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know but they're respectful
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know because i'm assuming if they
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
hit the nursing home you know
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking people are going to go to
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
jail so that we have current laws the
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
word use has to be put back in
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
i have a selectmen in goffstown that's
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
i think it's pretty clear what her
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
intention is
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
and that is to regulate guns in
 
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.990 align:start position:0%
and that is to regulate guns in
goffstown

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
and if i understand the word use from
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
what i'm being told by several attorneys
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
gun groups
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
if removed and stayed removed could
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
cause or allow the town
 
00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:53.430 align:start position:0%
cause or allow the town
to

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.030 align:start position:0%
to
regulate

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
gun ranges
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
a private shooting range on your own
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
private property that's what i'm being
 
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.150 align:start position:0%
private property that's what i'm being
told

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
told
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
even on private land
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
so public and private land they can ban
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
uh come to the schools um
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
hanover and other towns have tried to
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
ban guns in their schools
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is one of the few states
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
that allow guns in our schools
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
when they tried to ban it last term
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of teachers called me and said
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
please don't allow this to happen
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
because they want to carry guns to
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
protect the children
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
in case of a shooting
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
so luckily
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know did pass the house and the
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
senate and they got over to the governor
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
and he vetoed it
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
the other red flag for me is that the
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
supports this
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
because they know
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
that the town will be able to regulate
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
the use of guns
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
with the word use removed out of here
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
so i hope we can come to an agreement
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
you know to put this word back in there
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
you know because i don't want to give my
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
one selectmen that is from chicago area
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to restrict anybody in
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
goffstown or any district or any town
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
city in new hampshire
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
that may follow
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
the use of firearms on their private
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
property or in public properties
 
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.670 align:start position:0%
property or in public properties
that

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
is allowed currently
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
now i understand that you know the
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
mosquits you know is an issue
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
i think there's other ways to deal with
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know so i hope that we can come to
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
an agreement and put that word use thank
 
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.230 align:start position:0%
an agreement and put that word use thank
you

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
senator carson thank you um thank you mr
 
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.710 align:start position:0%
senator carson thank you um thank you mr
chairman

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
what we did specifically was look at
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
public we did not look at
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
private property and i think um and i
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
can't really speak for the rest of the
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh the senate we'll have to discuss it
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
that we would be open to
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
making whatever exemptions we needed for
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
private property i think is entirely
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate because after we passed this
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
we heard that oh my goodness they're
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
going to regulate private property
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
especially gun ranges and we don't want
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
to do that to happen but the ultimate
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
who governs the property that's owned by
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
is it the public and they're elected
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
officials at the local level or is it
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
going to be the state
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
um there are there is an existing
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
statute and i don't recall off the top
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
of my head what it is
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
that the legislature years ago gave the
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities the right to regulate
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
their their own land their public
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
property within their within their
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
confines and so
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
are are we going to overrule
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
the um the vote of the people if they
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
decide we do not want people firing guns
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
on our public property or our is the
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
legislature going to say you can't do
 
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.230 align:start position:0%
legislature going to say you can't do
that

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
um and and i think that is where things
 
00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:17.430 align:start position:0%
um and and i think that is where things
get

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
really really sticky and and i
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
understand representative
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
your concern about having someone who is
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
comes from a place that is anti-gun i
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
think we all know that chicago the city
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
of chicago has adopted a number of
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
anti-second amendment laws
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
that just don't work i mean i think
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
chicago has one of the highest death
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
rates by
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
firearm in the nation and it doesn't
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
work but it's their law
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's what they decided to do here in
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
the town of goffstown
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
or whoever
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
this person is representing as a
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
selectman can easily be voted out
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
at the next election
 
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.750 align:start position:0%
at the next election
but

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
i think where we're talking about public
 
00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.829 align:start position:0%
i think where we're talking about public
property

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:08.069 align:start position:0%
property
um

00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
we have to be very very careful because
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
everyone is the public and you have to
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
take into account
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
what the public wants in that particular
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
community and should the state have the
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
ability to override
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
a municipality and i think that's why
 
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.710 align:start position:0%
a municipality and i think that's why
the

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh municipal association supports this
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
because they feel people in the
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
municipality should be able to govern
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
the property that they that they are
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
that they own
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
rather than the state
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
so i thought what we did was we
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
recognized an individual's right
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to bear arms
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
no one should take that away from them
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
unless unless there are specific
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances but they should be able to
 
00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:55.430 align:start position:0%
circumstances but they should be able to
take

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
their gun if they decide to go on
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
a nature walk or on a rail trail or a
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
walk through
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
any kind of property that's open to the
 
00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:07.030 align:start position:0%
any kind of property that's open to the
public

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
no one should tell them you cannot bring
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
that gun on private property absolutely
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
not it's the we're talking about
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
when is it a pro when can you use it
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
on public property a lot of these rail
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
trails and sometimes these different
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
parks there are people that are all
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
around them people that live in their
 
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.189 align:start position:0%
around them people that live in their
homes

00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
and people that go out there and they
 
00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:33.509 align:start position:0%
and people that go out there and they
shoot

00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
shoot
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
these folks don't don't want them there
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
they don't want them shooting
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
in the woods behind their house i back
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
to conservation land in londonderry
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
there are people out there all the time
 
00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.389 align:start position:0%
there are people out there all the time
shooting

00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
shooting
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't bother me
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
i have two dogs in the fall i put orange
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
vests on them they're in my backyard
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
which is all chain linked but there's a
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
chance that something could happen i
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
take that precaution to protect
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
my animals
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
what happens behind there it's open for
 
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.790 align:start position:0%
what happens behind there it's open for
hunting

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
have fun
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
you can do that and that's that was a
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
decision that was made and that and
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
that's okay but there are other places
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
where there there are no fences and
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
people just go back out there and uh
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
quite often representative people are
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
irresponsible we have a number of people
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
that decide they want to come up from
 
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.230 align:start position:0%
that decide they want to come up from
massachusetts

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
and come shooting in londonderry on our
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
public property and the town has
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
addressed that and they've closed the
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
musquash for shooting because of
 
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
irresponsible people
 
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.470 align:start position:0%
irresponsible people
[Music]

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
but the question is do we take that
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
right away from the municipalities
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
and i don't have an easy answer for that
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
i do think though that
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
with this bill i it was a little
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
contentious because we went ahead and we
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
said hey listen you can
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
you can carry your your weapon on at
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
college that we got a lot of pushback
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
from that
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
but i think it's appropriate
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
i don't see why a college should ban
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
a student from having a gun if they are
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
a legal if they are a legal gun owner
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
they have every right to have that
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
unless they've done something wrong and
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
there are laws in place to take care of
 
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.309 align:start position:0%
there are laws in place to take care of
that

00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
um you know we heard stories about well
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
all the frat parties and people have
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
guns and you know people are doing it's
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
like no no no no no most most gun owners
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
are extremely responsible and they're
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
taught to be responsible
 
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.430 align:start position:0%
taught to be responsible
but

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think if we can address the private
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
land issue
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
and assure people that if you are on
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
your own property
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
you're on your own property and protect
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
the gun ranges i definitely think we
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
need to do that
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
with in this piece of legislation i
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
senator carson i couldn't ask
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
in respect to what happened with the
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
windogan getting shot out in londonderry
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
how close was that to where
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the person firing the firearm the
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
structure um they were
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
something that really shouldn't have
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
been they shouldn't have been using um
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
and they were caught uh our police did
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh catch them
 
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.590 align:start position:0%
uh catch them
so

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
but in respect to where the shot was
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
fired to where the building was like how
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
close were they um
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
approximately oh i i can't answer that
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
question i they were not adjacent to the
 
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.230 align:start position:0%
question i they were not adjacent to the
building

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
they were um
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
just being just completely irresponsible
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
they were they were in the woods and
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
they were firing at things and
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
they just
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know miscalculated whatever
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
um and it's the there is if you were to
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
because this is up near the airport
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
which is another issue
 
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.230 align:start position:0%
which is another issue
um

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
the manchester regional airport people
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
are using their weapons in the property
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
around the airport
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
um just not not a good thing because the
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
musk wash is
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh has parts of it that are around the
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
airport but if they were
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
caught by the police were they arrested
 
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.870 align:start position:0%
caught by the police were they arrested
yes

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
and prosecuted
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
so it was
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
is there an existing law though that if
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
they're violating an existing law
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
if you're allowed to use a firearm on
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
public property you still got to respect
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
the other laws in the book books if you
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
are acting in any type of reckless
 
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.230 align:start position:0%
are acting in any type of reckless
manner

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
you're still going to get arrested even
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
say allowed to use it you can't endanger
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
somebody if you're at a shooting range
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
and you
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
engage in reckless conduct while firing
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
using a firearm you're going to get
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
arrested so i guess by taking use out
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
because under my understanding current
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
law use is in
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
current law so if this were to not make
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
it out of this conference today the
 
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.430 align:start position:0%
it out of this conference today the
problem

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
with the word use
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
is not solved it's still going to be an
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
existing law so
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps that issue can be solved on a
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
in another year because and i look at
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
this policy is we have a preemption law
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
that really doesn't have an
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
enforceability side of it the purpose of
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
this was to have a way to enforce our
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
state's preemption laws i think that
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
the intent of what this does does a good
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's allowing you to enforce it and it
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
puts a it puts a procedure in place for
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
that but all i'm saying is
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
we don't come to an agreement here today
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
the use problem is still going to be a
 
00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:42.950 align:start position:0%
the use problem is still going to be a
problem

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
and the lack of teachers mr chair i
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
would agree with you completely because
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
of conflicting statutes and that's what
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
we saw was the conflicting statute that
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
gives the municipality the right to
 
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.230 align:start position:0%
gives the municipality the right to
regulate

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
land under their control
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
versus here
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
that conflict already exists and what we
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
tried to do was
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
address that particular conflict that's
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
in place and say look
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
if you're going to if the municipality
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
is going to regulate
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
you have the right to do so but you
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
cannot tell someone they cannot bring
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
their weapon
 
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.870 align:start position:0%
their weapon
into

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
on or onto private property you do have
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
the right
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
to say you can't use it here which is
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
which they do already in statute as well
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
and that is quite frankly what i think
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
needs to happen
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
is the legislature needs to look put
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
those statutes side by side and address
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
them and reconcile them
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
and that has not happened
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
but would it wouldn't the
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
the one that was
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
the most recent rsa supersede the prior
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
one might correct my incorrect when i
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
say that so there is a conflict
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
anyone have anything my understanding is
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
it would supersede the prior one
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
this one yeah
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
yes by the same we would be now removing
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
use and therefore every community could
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
regulate use out there they're going
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
forward and the problem with that is
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's when in rome i have a question if i
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
could and this may i apologize i somehow
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
was assigned to two committees at once
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
and i've yet been able to clone myself
 
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.470 align:start position:0%
and i've yet been able to clone myself
um

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
have have we discussed what use means
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
have we discussed
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
in other words if we go
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm allowed to carry my firearm
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
according to what the senator just said
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
i'm allowed to go hunting or what but if
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
i squeeze the trigger for whatever
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
reason have i violated their law
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
it was somewhat disgust my understanding
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
was that if for self-defense purposes
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's believed that you're not violating
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh i think
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
the state i know the municipalities are
 
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.669 align:start position:0%
the state i know the municipalities are
preempted

00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
preempted
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
from regularly hunting as well
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding i'm worried
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to set up a confusing
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
it it exactly that's why i would think
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
the having a standalone
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
debate on use as opposed to letting this
 
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.830 align:start position:0%
debate on use as opposed to letting this
fall

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
apart i think having a public hearing on
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
the word use and all that that would be
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
the way to go
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
because i i think at the same time
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
you have communities that are clearly
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
passing local ordinances that violate
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
the state law and
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
yeah you can go file an injunction but
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
i think your typical layperson doesn't
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
know how to do that
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's not the easiest process and it's
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
expensive to hire an attorney this this
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
gives you 307 once you get your legal
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
fees recovered so mr chairman what i'm
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about is if a municipality
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
by vote
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
a vote of the people
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
decide we
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
we don't want them to shoot on this
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
particular property
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
are we saying that you can't do that
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
are we telling people you don't have the
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
right to vote
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
on that particular issue well i'm
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
telling you the current law
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
already prevents that but there are
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's another rsa that
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
this applies to use in if it's within
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
300 feet
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
of a building and also says applies to
 
00:24:23.679 --> 00:24:24.710 align:start position:0%
of a building and also says applies to
parks

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
parks
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
outdoor public places for outdoor public
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
gatherings and playgrounds so we're not
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
saying all public property there's
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
already rsas that allow
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
that prohibit the use of a firearm at a
 
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.909 align:start position:0%
that prohibit the use of a firearm at a
park

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
park
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
or a playground
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
so there are some restrictions already
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
now i think the the property you're
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
discussing in londonderry i'm not
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
certain that would fall under any of
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
these i'm referring to rsa
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
644 colon 13.
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm not clear that that would
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
fall under any of those but
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a specific type of
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
public property
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
so i i just want to make sure i
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
understand this if i'm a private
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
property owner
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
and i do not wish to open my property to
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
hunting i have to go out and i have to
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
post it and i have to say no hunting
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
but the municipality on the property
 
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
that they own
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
they can't do that
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
under under existing law today that's
 
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.750 align:start position:0%
under under existing law today that's
correct

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
but that's existing law so i'm saying by
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
walking away from this and if anyone if
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm saying something that's entirely
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
accurate please correct me i'm really
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
going off a lot of memory up here
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative walls thank you mr
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
chairman just a simple
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
question from my members from the other
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
body what about the simple modifier
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
putting that back in
 
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.310 align:start position:0%
putting that back in
okay

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
i think you know we can consider that
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
lawful use is just that all lawful
 
00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
lawful use is just that all lawful
purposes

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
so if somebody was being negligent as
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
you described in the already adjudicated
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
situation in your hometown of
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
londonderry wouldn't that would this
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow prosecution to go
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
forward because it would not be a lawful
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
use of the firearm would you agree
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
senator i i could agree with that
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative rory thank you mr
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
chairman um just to the to the group in
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
general i think i understand what
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
senator carson is saying about you know
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
localities getting together and a
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
community of 300 people all vote no
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
we don't want any guns but what if that
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
same community people got together and
 
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.830 align:start position:0%
same community people got together and
said

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
you need a permit for speech
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
i mean the second amendment is
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
is a fundamental right of the citizens
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
so no locality municipality know how no
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
matter how well intentioned
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
is allowed to take away fundamental
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
rights just because
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
the mob if you will decided they don't
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
want it it's a fundamental american
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
right so no other we would not tolerate
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
it with any other
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional right
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
for our municipality to say you can't do
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
this here
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
although regulating it is is legitimate
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
but we have to be very careful because
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
it is a fundamental right
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative nice senator whitney
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you mr chair so just to that
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
point i you know
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
every right that we have another
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
constitution is important every right
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
and not one right should be elevated
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
over another and so the what you're
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
descri exactly what you're describing
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
would surely be challenged and not be
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional this you know
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
permit for for
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
right exactly
 
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.310 align:start position:0%
right exactly
so

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.430 align:start position:0%
so
every

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
if if a government decides to act
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
right then it needs to be
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
they have to have a governmental
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
interest and it needs to be balanced
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
right exactly so but but
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
i think it gets lost in the second
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
amendment conversation it is a right
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
under the constitution and people
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
interpret it different ways but it
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
should not be elevated over every other
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
right and so i think what senator carson
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
is describing is you know individuals
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
have property rights and in new
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
hampshire we care deeply about property
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
rights and i think we're also talking
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
about you know
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
town owned property is the property of
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
the entire municipality and there are
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
property rights there that need to be
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
balanced against the second amendment
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
and let me know if i'm speaking
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
incorrectly but all the point i'm trying
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
to make is
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
a separate standalone bill can be filed
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
to address use under rsa
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
644 colon 13. i'm just saying the issue
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
of use
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
is one topic this has to do with
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
enforcing having some way to enforce the
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
preemption laws for the communities that
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
completely ignore the state law if we're
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to have any type of preemption
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
whatsoever there needs to be a procedure
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
to enforce it and to not be something
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a tremendous
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
financial burden as someone you have a
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
legal background i'm sure you know that
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
legal expenses can really pile up for
 
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.710 align:start position:0%
legal expenses can really pile up for
someone

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
who's trying to simply address this this
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
gives them that and then why don't we
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
have the use conversation on a separate
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
bill so just to respond to that and by
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
the way i was a public interest lawyer
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i was never making the big bucks a
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
little lawyer but to respond to the
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
folks you interacted with there were two
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
but to respond to that you know if
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's the case then let's just strip
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
the law i mean i'm not saying that this
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
is something i would support but if
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's the case then just strip the rest
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
um because representative roy came in
 
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:38.950 align:start position:0%
um because representative roy came in
late

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
what we did was
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
we recognized the right that no
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
municipality has the right to tell any
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
gun owner they
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
do not have the right to take that gun
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
onto any
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
public property except i mean schools we
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
know public schools are different
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.269 align:start position:0%
know public schools are different
but

00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
whatever public property they own
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
the no municipality can tell
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
me senator french you anybody else who
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
owns a gun and carries gun that you
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
cannot take that on to public property i
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
think that was something that we felt
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
very very strongly but
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
our concern was the use and it is that
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
tension between gun owners
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
and people that own the property
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
and the municipalities own that property
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
and do they have the right to regulate
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
the use of that weapon on public
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
property that's that is the ultimate
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
question here and there are conflicting
 
00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:36.630 align:start position:0%
question here and there are conflicting
statutes

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
one statute says they do
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
but then you've got gun laws over here
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
that conflict and that's what we're
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with is this conflict but i i
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
hope we can all agree
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
that no municipality has the right to
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
tell a lawful gun owner that they do not
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
have the right to take that weapon onto
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative wallace thank you mr
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and i agree with you and i
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
think that the the lawful use
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
of a firearm would also
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh cover any concerns that some of us
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
have about
 
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.310 align:start position:0%
have about
um

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
the general use policy so for example um
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
it would allow and provide for the
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
protections on private property as well
 
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.870 align:start position:0%
protections on private property as well
because

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
lawful use would be all permitted
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
purposes on private property you know
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
and adding that lawful use it keeps
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
everything on the up and up and removes
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
silver's here you are the prime
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor of hb307
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
you heard a comment by representative
 
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.710 align:start position:0%
you heard a comment by representative
wallace

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
wallace
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
about perhaps
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
putting the word use back in but it's
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
saying lawful use
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
do you have any comment on that any
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
the existing preemption law contains the
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
worst word use
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
the amend the senate amendment would
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
take that out reenact the pre the
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
preemption law adding some enforcement
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
mechanism but take the word use out
 
00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:30.789 align:start position:0%
mechanism but take the word use out
so

00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
there is the the statute the other rsa
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with unlawful use of firearms in
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
different parts of a municipality
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
already exists
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
so what the senate amendment does it
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
takes the word use out
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
i don't see that there's any reason to
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
change the existing
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
language of the preemption law all we're
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
i haven't considered that i think
 
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.430 align:start position:0%
i haven't considered that i think
you

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
as it as the preemption law exists with
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
the word use in there
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
implied requirement in law that
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
everything you're permitted to do in law
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
must be lawful so it's already there
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's implied in law everything is
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
has to be done lawfully if you don't if
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
it's not done lawfully there's an rsa
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
that already governs itself respectfully
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of time and effort
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
cleaning up ambiguities in a law on a
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
regular very regular basis around here
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:38.470 align:start position:0%
would you agree
yeah

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair is to understand the point the
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
unlawful use
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
we don't need to
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
by saying lawful use we're basically
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
saying the unlawful use is illegal which
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
is already illegal
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
which is quite well taken represented
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
um mr chair if i if i might um if we
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
could take a recess
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
um so the senate can caucus
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
you may take all
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
a short
 
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.869 align:start position:0%
a short
research

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
huh

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
i call a
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:37.750 align:start position:0%

to order
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
i guess my opening statement would be i
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
i was curious as to why the repeal
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
and we discussed it and i understand
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
what the reasoning was
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
but by repealing that section we take
 
01:29:57.199 --> 01:29:58.149 align:start position:0%
but by repealing that section we take
out

01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
the restitution
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if we can come to an
 
01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.229 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if we can come to an
agreement

01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
where on uh
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
roman numeral four
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
we can only just we just take out shall
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
be guilty of a violation
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
and leave the restitution in we wouldn't
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
have to renumber anything it's just a
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
simple change
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
but the reason for the house bill 1011
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
was when people vandalized property we
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
had vandalism at the state house
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
we know who the vandals were but we they
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
all wasn't a violation it was don't they
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have to pay
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
in their mind
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
you got to have a a hammer hanging over
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
their head that was the reason for the
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
by deleting that section
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
so i i think if we can
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
it was changed the staff itself changed
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
um and we went back again we went back
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
and looked and we went back to the stats
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
what it was the way it was prior to the
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
change oh
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i keep forgetting about these
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's gonna i think
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
this whole thing
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
is is going to take a little while to uh
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
to get used to what we did mr chair was
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
we just went back to the statute
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
um as it was had been prior to two i
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
think it was either 2019 or 2020 when it
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
had been changed the penalty had been
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
lowered and we wanted to make sure that
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
the higher penalty was in place because
 
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
i think at the time that it was changed
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
um there were a lot of
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
issues with public property being
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
defaced and that was statues and things
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
that were being torn down
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
and uh the penalties were lowered and we
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
we did not want that in place we wanted
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
the higher uh penalty to be in place um
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
but if you are just looking to um
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh have the restitution piece i don't
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
think that i i can't speak for my
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
committee members right now but i mean i
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
think it's we can definitely consider
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
that if that's the only thing you really
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm learning
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
that was the reason for the bill terry
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
path came to me uh
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
oh in a previous session and we tried
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
and we didn't get it because of covert
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
so we we tried it again and uh
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
obviously we didn't look into it as
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
carefully as you did
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
but the restitution piece was important
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
because they when they vandalized out
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
front of the state house
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
they caught the vandals
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.719 --> 01:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
and even
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
bringing it back to the misdemeanor with
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
a stiffer penalty it doesn't provide for
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
restitution it provides for a fine which
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
may or may not cover and it doesn't
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
direct where the fine goes generally
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
fines go to the general fund which
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't do the restitution so that's why
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
we wanted the restitution okay so are
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
you saying um it's an either or that
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
they pay a fine
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
or a restitution or pay a fine and a
 
01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.189 align:start position:0%
or a restitution or pay a fine and a
restitution

01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
restitution
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
i would say it should be uh either or um
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
up to the judge i don't know what you
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
guys think
 
01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:47.830 align:start position:0%
guys think
well

01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
the restitution is to the is to the
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
whoever's property has been damaged
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
as a result of the vandalism the fine is
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
something that's just paid
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
kind of as a penalty for the offense
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
right but i don't want to make it so
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
that it's impossible to pay and then
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
nobody gets anything and they just end
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
up in jail i'd rather see the money get
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
to where it belongs so if it's
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm either way i'm okay i just
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to do double
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
as written you can't draft the rsa to
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
say this but my understanding in the
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
in the world when this is in a court
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
when when people work out a deal
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes providing restitution to the
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
property is something that's
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
considered favorable towards although
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
the the county attorney is not going to
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
help negotiate a private
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
civil settlement but they're gonna
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
basically if you pay restitution or are
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's something that luigi's
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes considered well let me ask is
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
do you feel that it's more important to
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
i think we're talking about public
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
property here and if they don't pay the
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's my my feeling
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
and if they damage something that's uh
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
well of historical value or or something
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's up to the judge
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
every case is different do you think
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
that if someone destroys something of
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
historical value and they're fined
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't get it it doesn't cut it
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
and i i was thinking that you've got
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
many communities in new hampshire you
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
have your town
 
01:35:30.639 --> 01:35:31.750 align:start position:0%
have your town
center

01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
and you know you have your statues of
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
your civil war veterans and and you know
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
you can have uh i know in londonderry we
 
01:35:39.679 --> 01:35:40.470 align:start position:0%
you can have uh i know in londonderry we
have

01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
um they sold bricks with names of of
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
people in honor of and it's all part of
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
this town common area
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
and they go out and seed it and you've
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
got the grass is growing nicely and
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
somebody decided they wanted to go four
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
wheel on it and ripped up all the lawn
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh fine
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
is not gonna
 
01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.550 align:start position:0%
is not gonna
compensate

01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
compensate
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
for the damage that's been done so
 
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's why i asked what do you think
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
would be more appropriate because i
 
01:36:08.239 --> 01:36:09.510 align:start position:0%
would be more appropriate because i
agree

01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think it would be appropriate a
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
fine and restitution is it more
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
important to pay restitution than a fine
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
my basic feeling is if there's a jail
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
sentence involved
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
if i were the judge i'd impose the jail
 
01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.390 align:start position:0%
if i were the judge i'd impose the jail
sentence

01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.070 align:start position:0%

suspended
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
provided the guy makes restitution and
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's the the
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
carrot and stick that uh we were looking
 
01:36:34.159 --> 01:36:37.350 align:start position:0%
carrot and stick that uh we were looking
for

01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
yeah restitution yeah
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
an either or somehow in other words
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
because somehow there might be something
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
where restitution is not appropriate i'm
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
trying to think of a situation where
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
necessary restitution
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
but i can't think of one so maybe we
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
just do restitution
 
01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.750 align:start position:0%
just do restitution
well

01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chairman if you have someone

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.350 align:start position:0%
who has
um

01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
destroyed a historical document
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
it's you can never be replaced it's it's
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
now gone
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
what and it would be up to the court to
 
01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.590 align:start position:0%
what and it would be up to the court to
determine

01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
determine
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
what is the restitution
 
01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.229 align:start position:0%
what is the restitution
um

01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:22.239 --> 01:37:23.350 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
i agree with that and i'm not the judge
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
in cases whether we give the tools to
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
the judge let the judge make the
 
01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.550 align:start position:0%
the judge let the judge make the
decision

01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%

02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that's um
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:17.199 --> 02:12:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
we had you had violation in the brackets
 
02:12:27.199 --> 02:12:28.709 align:start position:0%
we had you had violation in the brackets
okay

02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:28.719 --> 02:12:29.510 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%

okay
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
okay so i think we are in agreement on
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
the language so
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
i believe the procedure is we will aced
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
from our position you will aced from
 
02:12:42.550 --> 02:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
your position and we will adopt this as
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
the new position
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
and we will
 
02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
and we will
uh

02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:52.069 align:start position:0%
 
then

02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%

02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%

02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%

02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
oh it's a house bill's representative
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%

just before we begin the
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
the two verge the senate version in the
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
house version there com there's no
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
conflicting language amongst the two
 
02:17:17.519 --> 02:17:18.309 align:start position:0%
conflicting language amongst the two
and

02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
the cena version there was a supreme
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
court case that came down
 
02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
there was some conflicting language
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
between some of the regulations and some
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
of the rsas
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the senate
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
amendment what it would do it would
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
address that inconsistency which i think
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
is a good thing because that should be
 
02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:36.950 align:start position:0%
is a good thing because that should be
solved

02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
solved
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
right away however
 
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill has been completely
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
removed i am the prime sponsor of that
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
bill and i thought it was a good policy
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
it what it did is for third and fourth
 
02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:49.589 align:start position:0%
it what it did is for third and fourth
offenses

02:17:49.589 --> 02:17:49.599 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
expanded the look back period from what
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
is now 10 years 20 years we're talking
 
02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
about drunk driving convictions
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
we passed this
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
in the house criminal justice committee
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
last term it passed
 
02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:02.150 align:start position:0%
last term it passed
um

02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
it was all ultimately tabled but then at
 
02:18:05.669 --> 02:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
the same time this year we passed it and
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think it went on the consent calendar
 
02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:09.589 align:start position:0%
i think it went on the consent calendar
so

02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding they thought the
 
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
20-year look-back period from
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders was too long of a time
 
02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:18.790 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders was too long of a time
period

02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
so i guess the question is what we want
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
to do about it if anyone has any comment
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
send whitley thank you mr chair
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
so on the look back issue you know we
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
have to balance this with what we're
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish and if we're trying
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
to accomplish getting folks to not
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
reoffend again
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
putting them in jail is not the not the
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
right way to do it if people are
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
offending this many times it's because
 
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
they're they have a disease they have
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know they are alcoholics likely and
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
and to and to get them to not reoffend
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
again is to get them into treatment
 
02:18:54.549 --> 02:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
maybe it'll take the third a third time
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll take a fourth time we know
 
02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
that the way that this disease
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
progresses that people need to attempt
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
treatment many times putting them in
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
jail is not gonna you know help them get
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
better and so i think the senate uh
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
thought that that look back was a little
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
bit too long and thought that the
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
existing law we didn't hear many
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
problems with it it's the it's a good
 
02:19:16.150 --> 02:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
policy because you know it
 
02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
punishes people when necessary but also
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
um you know allows people to continue to
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
get treatment when necessary which is
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
the most effective way to get them to
 
02:19:29.429 --> 02:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519 align:start position:0%
yeah i had a problem with uh
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
21 years old get two dwis
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
back to back and then
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
the third one comes at 41 years old and
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're holding him to this long look back
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
so i was against the 20-year
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
can i just say ditto
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
i mean we we did have great discussions
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
about this particular issue i think
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
senator whitley makes
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
a great point about her reason why
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
20 years might be
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
excessive as well as senator french
 
02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
20 years is a long time and a person can
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
change within 20 years and you could
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
have an 18 year old or 20 year old go
 
02:20:22.469 --> 02:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
through a period of their life where
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
they might be drinking a little bit too
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
much and they
 
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
they get a dui
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it's going to follow them around for
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
the next 20 years and if they should
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh offend for a third time there's some
 
02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
extremely stiff penalties
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
um i i just felt that 20 years was just
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
too much of a look back wait wait too
 
02:20:44.479 --> 02:20:49.110 align:start position:0%
too much of a look back wait wait too
long

02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
i respected
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
you know alcoholisms that can be is a
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
disease but
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
offenders of this crime are not
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily alcoholics
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
there there's people who get
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
commit this offense and
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
we were just making the presumption that
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
so my concern is in the way i understand
 
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
how the law would work
 
02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
in order to be charged with a second
 
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
offense you would have had already been
 
02:21:15.270 --> 02:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
convicted of the first offense
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
so if you are charged with your first
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
offense and get arrested again
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
that would be another first offense you
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
actually have to have the conviction
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
before you move on to the next
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
your license is going to be suspended
 
02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
for a portion of that time period at the
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
second offense same thing
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
we hear about people on
 
02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
you see in the news and it's all over
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
the country you'll come across it this
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
person's been arrested or convicted five
 
02:21:39.910 --> 02:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
six times for drunk driving what happens
 
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
is when you have such a short look-back
 
02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
period of 10 years
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
is the person is really getting
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
convicted of first and second offenses
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
several times over
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
so we're not necessarily addressing the
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
problem it's not about throwing someone
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
in jail but we have someone who
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
i think in a 10-year time period has an
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
ample opportunity to seek help for the
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
condition they have
 
02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:02.870 align:start position:0%
condition they have
and

02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
we have a situation that's endangering
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
the public
 
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
i respect the opinion on that
 
02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
but i guess i would be open to see what
 
02:22:16.950 --> 02:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
what we're willing to compromise on
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the other section of this
 
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
the other this the amendment from the
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
from the senate is important addressing
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
drunk driving we if we care about
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
enforcing those penalties and doing it
 
02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:28.070 align:start position:0%
enforcing those penalties and doing it
properly

02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
properly
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
why would we not consider a
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
a harsher penalty for
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
if you're going to continue it's not a
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
harsher penalty but extend look back
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
period for repeat offender
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair okay
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
also to your point
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
what we're not taking into account in
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
the discussion is please
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
so you get arrested for a dui you don't
 
02:22:53.910 --> 02:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily get convicted you could
 
02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:55.030 align:start position:0%
necessarily get convicted you could
plead

02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
plead
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
so now you've got someone who's been
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
arrested for a numerous dua but you can
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
only look at the convictions and look
 
02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
back period
 
02:23:03.429 --> 02:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
so in that 10 years they could get
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
another and another and if they plead to
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
a lesser offense or it gets continued
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
without a finding
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
then the look-backs don't trigger so i
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
an extension of the current look-back
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
period i think is definitely in order
 
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
just because of the fact that not all of
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
them end up in convictions
 
02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:22.870 align:start position:0%
them end up in convictions
um

02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
because they plead to something else
 
02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
20 years okay as daryl said that maybe
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
too much is is there a number that may
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i want to echo
 
02:23:42.070 --> 02:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
what representative roy said he
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
actually studied before i had the
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity is that many times these
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
crimes are played down
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
exactly what he said i can't say it any
 
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
better and
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
that does not take away the fact that
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
yes you may have a person that does have
 
02:23:59.910 --> 02:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
a disease but you also have a person
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
that may have lost their life because of
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
another person's disease
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
and that does not mean that the person
 
02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
has not
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
has not had the opportunity or has not
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
already gone through a treatment program
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
many many times there are
 
02:24:14.479 --> 02:24:15.910 align:start position:0%
many many times there are
several

02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
several
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
several programs out there to help
 
02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
people that have
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
mental illnesses diseases of all sorts
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
that does not mean that you cannot hold
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
a person accountable for their own
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
actions whenever they're putting someone
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think you know if
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
i mean the set the senate made our
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
decision on the look back and i think it
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
be it would be helpful for me to see any
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know because i don't want to just
 
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
sort of speak on
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh what happened in other states or sort
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
of rhetoric it would be helpful if the
 
02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
house had any information about this
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
actually being a problem in new
 
02:24:58.640 --> 02:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
actually being a problem in new
hampshire

02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:00.389 align:start position:0%
hampshire
uh

02:25:00.389 --> 02:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know that would be helpful i think
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
any change to a look back we need to
 
02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:15.429 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
that is an example the problems with
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
that one is there was no
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
those are all still first offenses
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
they're and they're all they're all
 
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
separate so you
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
whether there's five separate charges
 
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
from separate incident you can have a
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
conviction on one two three who knows so
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's hard to
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
that's more of an issue of bail if you
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
in respect to the data
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say drunk driving is a
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
problem that's overwhelming the state
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we need to
 
02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
duck for cover here but it's still a pr
 
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's still an issue that's affecting us
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
and all i'm saying is if you look at the
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
penalties for a second offense
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's two different categories you can
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
follow one of them if you're arrested
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
within i think it's within a two year
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
period of the first offense but assuming
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
you don't fall in that you're looking at
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's 12 you can have a 17-day
 
02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:37.990 align:start position:0%
it's 12 you can have a 17-day
uh

02:26:37.990 --> 02:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
sentence but 12 of those are suspended
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
so you would have
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
five days must be served in the house of
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
corrections for this second offense the
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
third offense
 
02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
is it's 180 days but you can have 150
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
suspended so you're looking at
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
at 30 days
 
02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
all right so we're talking about an
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
additional 25 days assuming you're first
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
and second we're not within a two year
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
time window for the fourth offense
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:06.070 align:start position:0%
it's also
a

02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's the same 180 days 50 150 which can
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
be suspended so between a third and
 
02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:11.510 align:start position:0%
be suspended so between a third and
fourth

02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of time served
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
is actually in jails
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
it's the minimum sentence is the same
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
it's the second offense if the second
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
offense is within two years of the first
 
02:27:24.479 --> 02:27:25.830 align:start position:0%
offense is within two years of the first
offense

02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
offense
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
that is also
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
well it's it's 60 days but it's a 30
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
days suspended so you're doing 30 days
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
so the only time where you have that
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
increase is if your second offense is
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
racing within
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
two years after the first but within
 
02:27:42.389 --> 02:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
that 10-year time period that may have
 
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
third offense is a five-year loss of
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
license with the max of an indefinite
 
02:27:56.160 --> 02:27:57.349 align:start position:0%
license with the max of an indefinite
suspension

02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
suspension
 
02:27:57.359 --> 02:28:10.710 align:start position:0%
suspension
but

02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
look

02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
mr chairman considering a
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
a driving is a privilege right not a
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
rate that's actually a
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
i would have to agree with
 
02:28:35.429 --> 02:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
representative hawaii that
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's a reasonable request
 
02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
i i think the concern is that
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
in order for you to prosecute third and
 
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
fourth offenses is that the often the
 
02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
third offense is often not going to
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
mr sheriff i may i don't
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're prepared
 
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
to sit here and look at rewriting the
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
dui statutes
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
i think what the issue here is the
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
20-year look back
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
i believe i heard and i think it's
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative roy say is there a
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
different number
 
02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
that you would be willing to entertain
 
02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:42.630 align:start position:0%
that you would be willing to entertain
um

02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:44.309 --> 02:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
you guys want 10 i want the 20 i think
 
02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
here's the thing i just you know
 
02:29:59.750 --> 02:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
i have to have a reason for us to want
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
to change it and like i hear
 
02:30:04.630 --> 02:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
you know i i just don't see that this is
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
i don't hear that this is a problem in
 
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire like if this is
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to ruin lives as senator
 
02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:11.030 align:start position:0%
i don't want to ruin lives as senator
french

02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
french
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
is indicating i don't want to ruin lives
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
when we don't know that this is actually
 
02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:16.790 align:start position:0%
when we don't know that this is actually
happening

02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
like in the house did you hear testimony
 
02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
from law enforcement from whoever that
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
and they have the data about it i would
 
02:30:29.190 --> 02:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
love to see that
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
so you're telling me that you want data
 
02:30:34.070 --> 02:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
on whether people are arrested for drunk
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
driving three times
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
no data's supporting the need for a
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
20-year look-back
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
data supporting the need for a 20-year
 
02:30:43.110 --> 02:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
look-back or data supporting the need
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
for a 15-year look back what i'm saying
 
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
is that we that we have a 10 year look
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
back now
 
02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:49.510 align:start position:0%
back now
and

02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
that that seems to work and then like i
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
don't you know if there is data to
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
support the need to change the look back
 
02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
then that's what we need to see
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be honest
 
02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the time period of how
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
this would play out unless you're you're
 
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
getting your subsequent offenses without
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
a valid license i'm just pointing out
 
02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:08.389 align:start position:0%
a valid license i'm just pointing out
that

02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
second offense is a three-year loss of
 
02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:13.429 align:start position:0%
second offense is a three-year loss of
license

02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:31:15.750 --> 02:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
all right i'm just assuming that you're
 
02:31:17.190 --> 02:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
complying with the law in that time
 
02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:18.790 align:start position:0%
complying with the law in that time
period

02:31:18.790 --> 02:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
it's really seven years that you're
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to legally be driving i'm not
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
counting if the breathalyzer side of and
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
all that i mean there's more that can go
 
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
play into this
 
02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
i'm just it's for a third offense we're
 
02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
saying oh we don't want to
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
be able to charge my third offense we
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
need data to see that i'm just pointing
 
02:31:34.479 --> 02:31:35.190 align:start position:0%
need data to see that i'm just pointing
out

02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:31:36.870 --> 02:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's a third offense
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
whether the look back periods 10 years
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
20 years 30 years it's still the third
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
time they've done it so is it a problem
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
define what a problem is how many times
 
02:31:46.710 --> 02:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
does it have to happen before it's a
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
problem that we address i'm telling you
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
is it happening to the point that this
 
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
is an emergency and we must deal with it
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
right away i don't think that's the case
 
02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
but i don't need to see the frequency of
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
how long it's time often it's happening
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
i just see from a practical sense
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
your third offense or a fourth offense
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
all right if the person needs help
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
they've had plenty of time to get help
 
02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:10.469 align:start position:0%
they've had plenty of time to get help
now

02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
i understand 20 years is people want to
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
be critical of that i i understand that
 
02:32:16.469 --> 02:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
at least where they're coming from i
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
thought i think 15 years would be
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
a reasonable compromise
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's my my humble opinion i mean
 
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
i think that just is a misunderstanding
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
of the way that the disease progresses
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know you can't put a time frame i
 
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
mean that that's a whole separate issue
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
giving them enough time to get into
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
treatment you know if if the goal is to
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
get these people to not do these bad
 
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
things anymore we want them we want to
 
02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
give them the time to do the treatment
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
don't we
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
you're assuming that the offenders are
 
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
an alcoholic again correct and but and
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
also the you know
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
changing the well i mean if someone is
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
reoffending three or four times
 
02:32:58.630 --> 02:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
but there's a pretty high likelihood i
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
mean that's what we hear from the
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
treatment folks too also it doesn't
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
address this issue that senator french
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
is talking about about the age
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
difference and how you know we
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
mature right so if you have you know we
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
know and senator carson mentions this a
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
lot too that brains aren't fully
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
developed until 25.
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay so you you have
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know two offenses even at 25.
 
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
right and then you have your third event
 
02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
offense so you know it's complicated and
 
02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think like you know of course we want
 
02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that it's not a problem
 
02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
that they are having third offenses
 
02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're saying
 
02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
correct what we're saying is that if
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to change the the look back
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
we need to understand the significance
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
of how how much this is happening i'm
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
having a hard time falling you so a 21
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
year old their brain's not developed
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
enough to the point they understand that
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
drinking and driving creates a public
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
safety risk
 
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
i it's all different i i don't i have a
 
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
hard time we allow them to drink at age
 
02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:55.110 align:start position:0%
hard time we allow them to drink at age
21

02:33:55.110 --> 02:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
21
 
02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
legally if they're not mature enough to
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
drink i mean
 
02:33:58.080 --> 02:33:58.950 align:start position:0%
drink i mean
but

02:33:58.950 --> 02:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
they're not going to give them a the
 
02:34:02.309 --> 02:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
same punishment for drunk driving now
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
well and we're also talking about the
 
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
ability to get into treatment too right
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is a lot of times
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
when a person is
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
is in front of a judge for drinking and
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
driving whether it's a plea or
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
the actual conviction a lot of times
 
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
treatment is part of the sentence
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of i think
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
i've never known it not to be part of
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
the sentence the fact of the matter is
 
02:34:36.230 --> 02:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
i i i think i'm having a hard time
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
understanding how we can sit here and
 
02:34:38.319 --> 02:34:39.349 align:start position:0%
understanding how we can sit here and
say

02:34:39.349 --> 02:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:34:39.359 --> 02:34:40.309 align:start position:0%
say
well

02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
because a person has this
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to justify
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
not looking back because they may have
 
02:34:51.030 --> 02:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
had a problem
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
i mean it's a problem when
 
02:34:55.190 --> 02:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
a person's coming home from work when
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're 18 years old and they get hit by
 
02:34:59.270 --> 02:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
a drunk driver that's they've
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
done it three or four times that's
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's a serious problem and they're
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
still going to be and so i think we need
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
to be clear they're still going to be
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
punished we're not saying that these
 
02:35:09.270 --> 02:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
people should not be punished
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
right that they that
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
the punishment is still there we're just
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
talking about the look back
 
02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:16.469 align:start position:0%
talking about the look back
right

02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
it would be for first
 
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
punishment would be for would be for a
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
first offense though that's the problem
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
we're saying is that you're right they'd
 
02:35:26.309 --> 02:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
still be punished but as a first-time
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
offender even though they had been
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
convicted twice times two times before
 
02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:32.550 align:start position:0%
convicted twice times two times before
um

02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
is there any other crime that we can
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
think of that has a look-back period for
 
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
this is the only one we give we give
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
this kind of a treatment to where
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
well it's not your subsequent offense if
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
so much time is passed uh every other
 
02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
offense is
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair it's it's my understanding and
 
02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'm looking back at the testimony
 
02:36:03.270 --> 02:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
we heard in the senate
 
02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:04.230 align:start position:0%
we heard in the senate
that

02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
the 20-year look back is for third and
 
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
fourth offenses only
 
02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:09.830 align:start position:0%
fourth offenses only
so

02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
i i mean when we did this quite frankly
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
we were really concentrating on the
 
02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
definition of the word way
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
because there had been a recent supreme
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
court decision on rudder versus dmv that
 
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
affected how
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh way was determined and we the
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
attorney general came in and and they
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
were like we really need this defined
 
02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:34.710 align:start position:0%
were like we really need this defined
um

02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
i think that um senator well
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
we will consider an alternate um is
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
there a proposal for
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
something other than 20 years i i would
 
02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
propose 15 years
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
okay so 15 years as a compromise i think
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
senator french and i can accept that i
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
don't believe senator whitley can we'll
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
replace her and we can see how he does
 
02:36:57.439 --> 02:36:58.389 align:start position:0%
replace her and we can see how he does
that

02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
we can um
 
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
so my my suggestion mr chair is to
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh prepare that as a compromise
 
02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify that the house
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
version as written except for making it
 
02:37:17.830 --> 02:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
a 15-year lookout well we need um well
 
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
we need the definition of way yes and
 
02:37:23.110 --> 02:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
this is a compromise you will accept the
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
definition of way we will accept 15
 
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
years and that's the compromise we will
 
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
accept the senate
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
section word for word
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
house version make it 15 as opposed to
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
20. yes
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
so everybody's okay with the definition
 
02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
of way
 
02:37:46.230 --> 02:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
and why must that be part of this bill
 
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
it it needed to be it was that supreme
 
02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
court case i don't know it was march or
 
02:37:52.710 --> 02:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
whenever it came down
 
02:37:53.670 --> 02:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:37:55.270 --> 02:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
with the conflicting definitions of what
 
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
a way is that's an element of proving
 
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
the offense
 
02:37:58.240 --> 02:37:58.950 align:start position:0%
the offense
i

02:37:58.950 --> 02:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
i do credit the mighty fine defense work
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
that was done to to catch that however
 
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
that does need to be addressed right
 
02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:06.950 align:start position:0%
that does need to be addressed right
away

02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:08.230 align:start position:0%
away
like

02:38:08.230 --> 02:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:09.190 align:start position:0%
like
that's

02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
this was this bill it was least
 
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
at least according to our friends in
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
the senate it would believe to be
 
02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
germane to the topic
 
02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:18.710 align:start position:0%
germane to the topic
okay

02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
the attorney general did contact me
 
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
before that hearing
 
02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
asking my thought you know sent me the
 
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
case i reviewed it i had no problem with
 
02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
it being ad i gave it my blessing to add
 
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
it i was hoping my
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
underlying bill would survive as well
 
02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
and apparently did not
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
but i was all right with what the
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
attorney general was going for
 
02:38:38.469 --> 02:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
and i think it does address an immediate
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
problem it does mention some privately
 
02:38:42.389 --> 02:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
held lands that's my concern
 
02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
so private land can be like but keep in
 
02:38:47.110 --> 02:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
mind you go to like a grocery store
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's it's commercial property but it's
 
02:38:50.710 --> 02:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
private but public has a right of access
 
02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's different
 
02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:06.770 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
section b beginning on line 28 on page
 
02:39:12.399 --> 02:39:13.429 align:start position:0%
section b beginning on line 28 on page
one

02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
it says it says any person convicted of
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
a violation of rsa 265
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
a colon two section i subsection a and
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
the and the conviction is based you know
 
02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
or under reasonable equivalent offense
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
in an out-of-state jurisdiction
 
02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
occurring within
 
02:39:33.990 --> 02:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
10 years of the date of the present
 
02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.030 align:start position:0%
10 years of the date of the present
offense

02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
offense
 
02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:36.070 align:start position:0%
offense
so

02:39:36.070 --> 02:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:37.349 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:39:37.349 --> 02:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of a class a misdemeanor
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
do we want to make that consistent
 
02:39:41.359 --> 02:39:42.389 align:start position:0%
do we want to make that consistent
between

02:39:42.389 --> 02:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
i think the intent of what that section
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
was is that if you did get a subsequent
 
02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:00.230 align:start position:0%
was is that if you did get a subsequent
offense

02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
offense
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
what it was doing
 
02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:02.630 align:start position:0%
what it was doing
a

02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:40:04.469 --> 02:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
conviction for a first offense is a
 
02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
class b misdemeanor this was this is
 
02:40:09.990 --> 02:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
making it a class
 
02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:10.710 align:start position:0%
making it a class
a

02:40:10.710 --> 02:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to know what they were
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
doing yeah
 
02:40:18.319 --> 02:40:21.510 align:start position:0%
doing yeah
so

02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:23.349 --> 02:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to use 15 that
 
02:40:23.359 --> 02:40:24.230 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to use 15 that
section

02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:25.990 align:start position:0%
section
b

02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
b
 
02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
15 as well
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
we catch
 
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:40.309 --> 02:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
we have no
 
02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:44.080 align:start position:0%

02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
we now close the committee conference on
 
02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
just

02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
before we before we break any longer
 
02:41:16.309 --> 02:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
my friends in the senate in respect to
 
02:41:18.150 --> 02:41:18.160 align:start position:0%

02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's when you said you were available
 
02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
so if you can do it earlier that would
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think i said that on
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
so we would now just i have to quickly
 
02:41:42.790 --> 02:41:42.800 align:start position:0%

good afternoon representative daryl

abbess representing rockingham county

04:32:55.590 --> 04:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
just before we have two
 
04:32:59.110 --> 04:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
two versions of this there is a
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
pass in the senate and one there's a
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
version of passing the house that
 
04:33:04.551 --> 04:33:04.561 align:start position:0%
they're very different
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
they could technically on their own
 
04:33:06.160 --> 04:33:07.670 align:start position:0%
they could technically on their own
survive

04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
survive
 
04:33:07.680 --> 04:33:08.869 align:start position:0%
survive
together

04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
but they don't necessarily have to
 
04:33:12.070 --> 04:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
they address different parts but if you
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
want to go around let each side
 
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
explain their position on each one we
 
04:33:21.750 --> 04:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
04:33:24.240 --> 04:33:25.429 align:start position:0%
representative barry
so

04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:28.070 --> 04:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
1476 is passed by the house is
 
04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
significantly different than what the
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
senate excuse me replaced it with
 
04:33:38.629 --> 04:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
1476 addresses repeat
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
arrestees more than likely criminal
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
offenders but you are innocent until
 
04:33:45.990 --> 04:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
proven guilty so we're talking 1476
 
04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
deals with people who are currently out
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
on bail and are arrested again
 
04:33:51.520 --> 04:33:53.269 align:start position:0%
on bail and are arrested again
for

04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
if you have an area that has been
 
04:33:58.629 --> 04:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
affected by the bail reform city of
 
04:34:01.269 --> 04:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
manchester rochester
 
04:34:02.551 --> 04:34:02.561 align:start position:0%
you know anywhere you find one of the
 
04:34:04.470 --> 04:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
county jails
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
you get a lot of the
 
04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
negative effects of
 
04:34:11.429 --> 04:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
the rapid release of people who are
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
arrested committing crimes
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
because they're dumped back out into
 
04:34:16.869 --> 04:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
your community um so somebody who's
 
04:34:20.230 --> 04:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
who's arrested in medford or new boston
 
04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
ends up in my city of manchester um
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
often to be
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
rapidly arrested again and if you listen
 
04:34:29.189 --> 04:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
to the patrolmen
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
whose i've spoken with extensively
 
04:34:34.470 --> 04:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
they will arrest people who are laughing
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the back
 
04:34:38.310 --> 04:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
of their squad car because they know
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
that they will be back out onto the
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
streets before the officer has finished
 
04:34:44.310 --> 04:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
the paperwork
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
so 1476 attempts to address that and
 
04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
close that so that people can stop
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
flouting the law
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
specifically in manchester in our other
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
cities such as nashua rochester i
 
04:34:58.709 --> 04:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
imagine conker probably experiences some
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
of this as well
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
so that is what 1476 deals with it's on
 
04:35:05.830 --> 04:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
the second arrest for all crimes
 
04:35:07.269 --> 04:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
and then it's on the third arrest for
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
class b misdemeanors that was
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
that was done as a negotiation
 
04:35:13.349 --> 04:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
with people who were opposed to it
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
because getting a coalition together
 
04:35:19.590 --> 04:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
to to pass the house has been a um
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
well if you think i worked hard on
 
04:35:22.230 --> 04:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
redistricting i promise you i worked
 
04:35:24.150 --> 04:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
harder on bail reform in the house it
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
takes a
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
lot of negotiation a lot of explaining
 
04:35:27.760 --> 04:35:29.590 align:start position:0%
lot of negotiation a lot of explaining
things

04:35:29.590 --> 04:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:35:31.990 --> 04:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
and 1476 when it passed the house passed
 
04:35:38.070 --> 04:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:39.750 --> 04:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i just wanted to um follow
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
up a little bit on what representative
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
connolly said
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's um
 
04:35:49.750 --> 04:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
barry excuse me sorry
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
it's not just certain towns that are it
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
affects every single town in new
 
04:35:55.199 --> 04:35:56.230 align:start position:0%
affects every single town in new
hampshire

04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:35:58.390 --> 04:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
there's no borders and
 
04:35:58.400 --> 04:35:59.269 align:start position:0%
there's no borders and
um

04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:01.510 --> 04:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
even the smaller towns that have to deal
 
04:36:03.510 --> 04:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
with this issue be it people they had to
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
release or people released from other
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
communities so i it affects the entire
 
04:36:07.840 --> 04:36:13.029 align:start position:0%
communities so i it affects the entire
state

04:36:13.029 --> 04:36:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:13.039 --> 04:36:14.551 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:36:14.551 --> 04:36:14.561 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
i spoke with a
 
04:36:16.080 --> 04:36:17.029 align:start position:0%
i spoke with a
chief

04:36:17.029 --> 04:36:17.039 align:start position:0%
chief
 
04:36:19.990 --> 04:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
from up north who told me that
 
04:36:21.750 --> 04:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
he had um
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
arrested the same individual three or
 
04:36:24.709 --> 04:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
four times
 
04:36:26.551 --> 04:36:26.561 align:start position:0%
and that individual ended up oding and
 
04:36:26.561 --> 04:36:27.590 align:start position:0%
and that individual ended up oding and
dying

04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
dying
 
04:36:28.949 --> 04:36:28.959 align:start position:0%
and he said you know we could have done
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
something for that person but we just
 
04:36:32.789 --> 04:36:32.799 align:start position:0%
kept taking him in and throwing them
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
back out taking him in and throwing him
 
04:36:36.310 --> 04:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
back out taking him in and throwing it
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
back out
 
04:36:37.359 --> 04:36:38.390 align:start position:0%
back out
um

04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is a real
 
04:36:43.590 --> 04:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think when and i wasn't here when the
 
04:36:43.600 --> 04:36:45.510 align:start position:0%
i think when and i wasn't here when the
legislator

04:36:45.510 --> 04:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
passed the last bail reform package but
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
i did watch and go through and read all
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
the notes and i don't think that was
 
04:36:52.709 --> 04:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
anybody's intention i think the original
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
bail reform was supposed to be targeted
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
towards making sure that people weren't
 
04:36:59.429 --> 04:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
holding poor people for minor crimes um
 
04:37:00.310 --> 04:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's something we can all
 
04:37:01.830 --> 04:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
agree on but when we we're we're talking
 
04:37:02.949 --> 04:37:02.959 align:start position:0%
about people who are already out of bail
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
i mean these are people who've been
 
04:37:12.629 --> 04:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
senator bradley uh good afternoon mr
 
04:37:17.830 --> 04:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
chair so um
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
as you know we've worked together on
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
this language
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
the language
 
04:37:26.070 --> 04:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
that the senate adopted in
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 1476
 
04:37:32.949 --> 04:37:32.959 align:start position:0%
is your language representative abbas
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
you gave it to us
 
04:37:36.789 --> 04:37:36.799 align:start position:0%
we adopted it
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
as is
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
we obviously consulted with
 
04:37:43.269 --> 04:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
the police chiefs
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
we dropped the provision in
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
house bill or senate bill 294 that was
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
similar to the provision in
 
04:37:53.189 --> 04:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative berry's bill
 
04:37:53.199 --> 04:37:53.990 align:start position:0%
representative berry's bill
at

04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:37:54.000 --> 04:37:54.830 align:start position:0%
at
your

04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
suggestion because you thought it would
 
04:37:57.119 --> 04:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
suggestion because you thought it would
be

04:37:57.990 --> 04:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
easier to get it through the house so
 
04:38:01.269 --> 04:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
i've done
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
and the senate has done
 
04:38:08.629 --> 04:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
the difference between the two bills
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
the language in the senate version of
 
04:38:18.949 --> 04:38:18.959 align:start position:0%
1476 actually
 
04:38:21.910 --> 04:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
targets the biggest problem the violent
 
04:38:24.070 --> 04:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
offenders i would like to have repeat
 
04:38:25.349 --> 04:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
offenders in
 
04:38:27.029 --> 04:38:27.039 align:start position:0%
and if it's the will of this committee
 
04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
of conference
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
we could
 
04:38:30.240 --> 04:38:31.269 align:start position:0%
we could
either

04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:38:33.269 --> 04:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that the language of
 
04:38:34.629 --> 04:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative barry's bill is
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
um you know the provisions that you
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
wrote in 1476 or we could go to the
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
language in 294
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
that talks about repeat offenders i'm
 
04:38:50.070 --> 04:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
happy to do that but it was your
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
suggestion representative abbas that we
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
dropped it
 
04:38:56.070 --> 04:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm good with that because it was
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
your suggestion
 
04:39:00.629 --> 04:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
but it targets violent
 
04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
the language in the senate bill targets
 
04:39:03.279 --> 04:39:04.310 align:start position:0%
the language in the senate bill targets
violent

04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
violent
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
criminals and that's where the biggest
 
04:39:08.390 --> 04:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
problem is and that's what we should be
 
04:39:10.709 --> 04:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
respectfully when it comes to drop in a
 
04:39:12.879 --> 04:39:14.390 align:start position:0%
respectfully when it comes to drop in a
section

04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
and with senate bill 294
 
04:39:17.039 --> 04:39:17.990 align:start position:0%
and with senate bill 294
which

04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
that section if that bill has drafted or
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
even some of the amendments that float
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
on floated around the house would
 
04:39:25.349 --> 04:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
conflict because it's a much longer more
 
04:39:27.189 --> 04:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
intensive bill would have a provision
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
that would conflict
 
04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
with what
 
04:39:29.840 --> 04:39:30.709 align:start position:0%
with what
hp

04:39:30.709 --> 04:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
hp
 
04:39:30.719 --> 04:39:31.429 align:start position:0%
hp
uh

04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
1476 does
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
so in what i sent it it doesn't change
 
04:39:38.868 --> 04:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
this section the reason why is that they
 
04:39:41.110 --> 04:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
conflict so you can have a debate on
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
just 1476 and then the rest of what 294
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
would have done
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
senate bill 295 the idea is to not have
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
you don't want to have
 
04:39:50.240 --> 04:39:51.110 align:start position:0%
you don't want to have
a

04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
much larger bill impacting this because
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
if that bill wanted to go forward this
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
bill would not have its own
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
and that's why your suggestion we
 
04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
dropped the repeat offender provision
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
and it's not in the center pass version
 
04:40:06.470 --> 04:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
of 1476.
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm referencing 294. 294. i don't
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
want to i don't want to actually address
 
04:40:13.590 --> 04:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
the idea was i'm just saying that when
 
04:40:15.840 --> 04:40:15.850 align:start position:0%
we discussed 294 which we did
 
04:40:15.850 --> 04:40:17.270 align:start position:0%
we discussed 294 which we did
[Music]

04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:40:19.110 --> 04:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
quite a bit
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
and the language that is now in 1476 is
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
what you gave me visa v294
 
04:40:25.920 --> 04:40:26.788 align:start position:0%
what you gave me visa v294
so

04:40:26.788 --> 04:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
i went with your suggestion to drop
 
04:40:33.110 --> 04:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
the repeat offenses and we just stuck
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
with your language on 1476.
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
the reason why i wouldn't change 1470
 
04:40:40.310 --> 04:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
because i sent it was an amendment to
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 294 exactly but the point
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
i'm making is we're willing to accept
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
your suggestion your so-called
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
compromise but the more important piece
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
of this entire effort is violent
 
04:40:57.190 --> 04:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
criminals and i think that's pretty
 
04:41:00.150 --> 04:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
clear and i think my conversation that
 
04:41:01.830 --> 04:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative barry you and i had a
 
04:41:04.150 --> 04:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago offline
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
was that
 
04:41:06.000 --> 04:41:06.868 align:start position:0%
was that
if

04:41:06.868 --> 04:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:41:08.070 --> 04:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
you know and i don't want to put words
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
in your mouth but certainly my memory of
 
04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
the conversation was
 
04:41:13.270 --> 04:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
we should be targeting
 
04:41:16.150 --> 04:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
violent criminals and that's what the
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
cenopass version does with the support
 
04:41:20.948 --> 04:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
of the police chief so we're out there
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
day in and day out
 
04:41:23.840 --> 04:41:25.030 align:start position:0%
day in and day out
defending

04:41:25.030 --> 04:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
defending
 
04:41:27.910 --> 04:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
our communities i agree repeat offenders
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
are a real problem but
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
i think the larger problem is people
 
04:41:32.480 --> 04:41:33.510 align:start position:0%
i think the larger problem is people
that

04:41:33.510 --> 04:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
have been alleged to have committed a
 
04:41:38.070 --> 04:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
violent crime getting bail immediately
 
04:41:38.948 --> 04:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:41:40.868 --> 04:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
recommitting another violent crime that
 
04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
they should have been held for and see a
 
04:41:42.798 --> 04:41:43.910 align:start position:0%
they should have been held for and see a
judge

04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
judge
 
04:41:45.190 --> 04:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
before they get
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
bailed and to me
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
that should be the focus of
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
what we're doing especially since
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
representatives your language
 
04:41:57.430 --> 04:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
i i i like it and i did i did help write
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
it but my understanding is getting it
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
over the finish line is the issue
 
04:42:01.200 --> 04:42:01.990 align:start position:0%
over the finish line is the issue
and

04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:02.000 --> 04:42:02.868 align:start position:0%
and
this

04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:42:05.190 --> 04:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
past in the house i can't even get the
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
other my language
 
04:42:09.110 --> 04:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
for a discussion on the house and i
 
04:42:11.110 --> 04:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
tried very hard what can i normally
 
04:42:12.948 --> 04:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
report on
 
04:42:15.510 --> 04:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
this bill in the senate if i might and i
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
think there is you know representatives
 
04:42:19.350 --> 04:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement maybe you'd call on
 
04:42:22.470 --> 04:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
them to also talk about it but in the
 
04:42:24.430 --> 04:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
hearing report on
 
04:42:24.440 --> 04:42:26.390 align:start position:0%
hearing report on
1476

04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
1476
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
chief ho becky
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
said specifically they support senate
 
04:42:32.948 --> 04:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
bill 294 because it addresses the issue
 
04:42:35.750 --> 04:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
of violent repeat offenders and how to
 
04:42:38.230 --> 04:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
remedy many of the situations that have
 
04:42:40.230 --> 04:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
occurred so
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
when they were talking about 1476 they
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
were referencing what the real problem
 
04:42:47.910 --> 04:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
is violent offenders in that hearing
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
that's why i mean we
 
04:42:52.230 --> 04:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
04:42:53.910 --> 04:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
took your language
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
and put it into representative barry's
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
bill because that's the bigger issue i
 
04:42:58.798 --> 04:43:00.390 align:start position:0%
bill because that's the bigger issue i
agree

04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
repeat offense is a problem but i think
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
we should be
 
04:43:06.230 --> 04:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know targeting
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
the bigger problem
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
and just
 
04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
let's understand the two policies here
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
hp 1476 is passed by the house what it
 
04:43:15.120 --> 04:43:15.990 align:start position:0%
hp 1476 is passed by the house what it
does

04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
someone's out on bail
 
04:43:19.350 --> 04:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's a couple other
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
if they're on bail waiting a sentence
 
04:43:22.948 --> 04:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
what not
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
the person is charged with a class b
 
04:43:28.230 --> 04:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor which is a by the way it's a
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
crime that you wouldn't ordinarily go
 
04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
jail for
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
third or subsequent events it shall be
 
04:43:35.270 --> 04:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
detained for a period not
 
04:43:37.510 --> 04:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's not more than 36 hours
 
04:43:37.520 --> 04:43:38.788 align:start position:0%
that's not more than 36 hours
what

04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:43:39.910 --> 04:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
the senate version that i helped draft
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
what that would do
 
04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily have to be out on
 
04:43:46.230 --> 04:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
bail so you can be dealing with a
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
first-time offender but the crimes
 
04:43:49.750 --> 04:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with are much more
 
04:43:49.760 --> 04:43:50.868 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with are much more
serious

04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
serious
 
04:43:53.110 --> 04:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
violent crimes against a person
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
or a sex crime against a child that's
 
04:43:56.948 --> 04:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
what the scope of what the list of
 
04:43:59.110 --> 04:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
offenses are and in that case it's the
 
04:44:01.830 --> 04:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
same thing it's 36 hours you're not
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
going in front of a bail commissioner
 
04:44:05.830 --> 04:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
you're going in front of a judge
 
04:44:08.550 --> 04:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
now the appetite of the house i'm i i
 
04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
will never understand why they would
 
04:44:10.160 --> 04:44:11.190 align:start position:0%
will never understand why they would
support

04:44:11.190 --> 04:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
1476 but not what
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
i was hoping would be
 
04:44:19.030 --> 04:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment to senate bill 294 but
 
04:44:21.270 --> 04:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's what happened so here we are so i
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
guess what can we get over the finish
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.110 --> 04:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
senator susan could i just add something
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
because i was actually one of the people
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
sitting around the table we negotiated
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
the original bail reform and you're
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
correct that the intent was to ensure
 
04:44:36.070 --> 04:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
that just because somebody didn't have a
 
04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
dollar in their pocket they weren't
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
sitting in
 
04:44:41.430 --> 04:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
in jail um
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
flash forward and living in the city of
 
04:44:45.510 --> 04:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
manchester and talking to the chiefs and
 
04:44:47.590 --> 04:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
recognizing there have been some
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
instances where
 
04:44:51.670 --> 04:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
because and we don't need to get into a
 
04:44:53.190 --> 04:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
whole discussion about the bail
 
04:44:55.830 --> 04:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
commission system but let's just say the
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
system has had difficulties i think
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
handling the bail reform legislation as
 
04:45:04.150 --> 04:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
it currently is particularly as it
 
04:45:07.110 --> 04:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
relates to extremely violent offenders
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
and what that has in turn done is made
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
some victims
 
04:45:12.948 --> 04:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
unwilling to
 
04:45:14.868 --> 04:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
participate in the prosecution of the
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
alleged perpetrator
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
when this bill passed when 294 passed
 
04:45:22.510 --> 04:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
but particularly when the version of
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
1476 past the senate passed on a 21-3
 
04:45:26.638 --> 04:45:27.750 align:start position:0%
1476 past the senate passed on a 21-3
vote

04:45:27.750 --> 04:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
um there were there was one republican
 
04:45:32.788 --> 04:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
two democrats that made up the three and
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
then obviously the balance of the senate
 
04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
so the legislation
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
as it stands before you
 
04:45:42.150 --> 04:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
the senate version has significant
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support and just to reiterate
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
senator bradley's concern
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
the concern we were hoping to address
 
04:45:51.750 --> 04:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
was those who have committed violent
 
04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
offenses and ensuring
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
that there was the ability for a judge
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
to make the determination
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that's how we got to where
 
04:46:03.590 --> 04:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
we are at least from this side of the
 
04:46:05.750 --> 04:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
table and i do recognize that obviously
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
the the house
 
04:46:10.150 --> 04:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
reacted differently but it was it was
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
clear and it was bipartisan in our
 
04:46:12.480 --> 04:46:15.510 align:start position:0%
clear and it was bipartisan in our
support

04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative ross
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative sorry i've been called
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
no one's wrong here
 
04:46:26.310 --> 04:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
no one's wrong here and that's the
 
04:46:26.320 --> 04:46:27.350 align:start position:0%
no one's wrong here and that's the
problem

04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:46:27.360 --> 04:46:29.830 align:start position:0%
problem
um

04:46:29.830 --> 04:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:31.830 --> 04:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
the addressing the violent offense is
 
04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
something that on a personal level i
 
04:46:36.310 --> 04:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
would love it if we would do that and
 
04:46:38.550 --> 04:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
senator bradley's not incorrect i would
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support that in fact i'd
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
probably go a step further that many
 
04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
people here wouldn't be comfortable and
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
i get rid of pr bail entirely i think
 
04:46:48.550 --> 04:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't like cashless bail
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
i've made that clear from the beginning
 
04:46:52.390 --> 04:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
so it's not a it's not a lack of of will
 
04:46:55.110 --> 04:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
on at least the people that are here for
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
the violent crimes um
 
04:46:59.670 --> 04:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
the issue we have is we have to count
 
04:47:01.270 --> 04:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
votes in the house
 
04:47:03.990 --> 04:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
and it is something um
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know you had three two democrats and
 
04:47:07.110 --> 04:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
one republican the only people that
 
04:47:07.120 --> 04:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
one republican the only people that
opposed

04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
04:47:10.550 --> 04:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
your bill but i had i believe
 
04:47:10.560 --> 04:47:11.670 align:start position:0%
your bill but i had i believe
um

04:47:11.670 --> 04:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:13.350 --> 04:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
it would be in the hundreds
 
04:47:15.190 --> 04:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
when we had similar language come across
 
04:47:16.868 --> 04:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
to the house
 
04:47:17.910 --> 04:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm not speaking let me be very
 
04:47:19.350 --> 04:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
clear i'm about i'm not speaking for
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
myself right now
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
the house
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
the house bought the house majority of
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
which i was not a part
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
does not like
 
04:47:28.798 --> 04:47:29.590 align:start position:0%
does not like
the

04:47:29.590 --> 04:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
one and done i disagree with them
 
04:47:33.670 --> 04:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly i disagree with them but
 
04:47:35.350 --> 04:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
i also have to live in the reality of
 
04:47:36.868 --> 04:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
counting votes
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
and we were able to count votes and get
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
1476 across
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
um i fully acknowledge it's a much
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
higher easier hurdle to get what i view
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
as the right thing done in the senate
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately there's just no
 
04:47:51.910 --> 04:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
appetite in the house under its current
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
makeup we have an election in november
 
04:47:55.990 --> 04:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully things will change hopefully
 
04:47:58.150 --> 04:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
people will change out by the way on
 
04:48:00.150 --> 04:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
both sides it's not exclusively a
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
partisan issue there are some partisan
 
04:48:03.670 --> 04:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
lines but it is not exclusively a
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
partisan issue when we
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
when we passed 1476 i had
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
many manchester democrats helping me and
 
04:48:12.550 --> 04:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
cheering me along the line some of them
 
04:48:14.550 --> 04:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this
 
04:48:14.560 --> 04:48:16.868 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this
so

04:48:16.868 --> 04:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:18.628 --> 04:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying my message is is the
 
04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
votes do not exist
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
for anything that looks like 294 or 92.
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
i'm also saying i wish they did
 
04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
i wish they did and i would fight like
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
hell to get them in fact i did
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
they just don't exist
 
04:48:36.788 --> 04:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
the votes exist for 1476. i wish 1476
 
04:48:39.030 --> 04:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
went farther i wish it had a provision
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
about one and done on violent crimes i
 
04:48:42.788 --> 04:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
just made my position about pr bill
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
known entirely i want it gone entirely
 
04:48:46.628 --> 04:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't exist
 
04:48:49.830 --> 04:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
and if we continue to push a position
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
that will die in the house that i cannot
 
04:48:51.920 --> 04:48:53.270 align:start position:0%
that will die in the house that i cannot
control

04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
we are basically saying we are done for
 
04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
the year we're not going to do anything
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep letting people out
 
04:49:01.270 --> 04:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's never going to stop
 
04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
and i know i'm not trying to impugn your
 
04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
motive i understand your motive i agree
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
with it that you want to
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
stop the violent offenses i'm all in
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
but i have to live in reality and the
 
04:49:14.390 --> 04:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
reality is is when this when something
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
similar like this came across
 
04:49:18.070 --> 04:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
and they tabled it and i believe the
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
table was two to one
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then when they went to take it off
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
the table it died three to one
 
04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:28.628 --> 04:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
the house is a weird beast i'm a
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
freshman but i've learned a lot in two
 
04:49:31.510 --> 04:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
years and i feel like i feel like in
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
certain ways i've served like four terms
 
04:49:35.590 --> 04:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
in two years
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
but i have learned that once
 
04:49:40.550 --> 04:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
that body makes up its mind and votes
 
04:49:42.708 --> 04:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
one way moving it is a
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
nearly insurmountable task and you're
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
asking of us
 
04:49:48.070 --> 04:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
04:49:50.310 --> 04:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
that i i just don't know where i'm gonna
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
find the votes i had to do things to get
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
for i had to water down 1476 you go back
 
04:49:57.030 --> 04:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
and you look at the speech i i even said
 
04:49:59.110 --> 04:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
at one point i got criticism ironically
 
04:50:00.868 --> 04:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
enough from people on the left i was
 
04:50:01.830 --> 04:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
like how much more are you going to
 
04:50:03.750 --> 04:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
water this down i said until we get the
 
04:50:03.760 --> 04:50:04.788 align:start position:0%
water this down i said until we get the
votes

04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
votes
 
04:50:07.270 --> 04:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
and i stopped when we had the votes and
 
04:50:09.110 --> 04:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
it just it just is what it is and i i
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
don't want to leave here with nothing
 
04:50:13.750 --> 04:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
but you guys need to understand that
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
you're effectively putting us in the all
 
04:50:16.390 --> 04:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
or nothing situation i know it's not
 
04:50:18.150 --> 04:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
what you want to do i get it i totally
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
get that but it's effectively what's
 
04:50:21.670 --> 04:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
happening and
 
04:50:24.788 --> 04:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know you know how long
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know my city has to scream
 
04:50:28.550 --> 04:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know how long other cities have
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
to scream i don't know how long
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire have to scream
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
about this but to us to walk away from
 
04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
this with nothing is insane
 
04:50:38.868 --> 04:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
and we need to
 
04:50:40.070 --> 04:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
figure out i don't know how to convey
 
04:50:42.628 --> 04:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
this and i i the the chairman of uh the
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
chairman ruled me out of order at the
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
time and gave me some indulgence when i
 
04:50:49.350 --> 04:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
it was it was the warning because i knew
 
04:50:53.350 --> 04:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
we'd end up here and i knew we'd end up
 
04:50:54.310 --> 04:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
with me
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
pleading with you
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:08.788 --> 04:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
senator bradley so my understanding is
 
04:51:08.798 --> 04:51:10.628 align:start position:0%
senator bradley so my understanding is
when

04:51:10.628 --> 04:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:51:12.390 --> 04:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh this bill went to the floor it was
 
04:51:15.030 --> 04:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
without a committee recommendation
 
04:51:15.040 --> 04:51:16.948 align:start position:0%
without a committee recommendation
and

04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
there wasn't
 
04:51:23.110 --> 04:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
a clear path of what was going to happen
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
so it's a
 
04:51:26.550 --> 04:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
pretty different scenario that we have
 
04:51:26.560 --> 04:51:27.430 align:start position:0%
pretty different scenario that we have
today

04:51:27.430 --> 04:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
in my view
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i've also served in the house and i
 
04:51:34.550 --> 04:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
know that it can be difficult to get 201
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
i understand the dilemma of that
 
04:51:39.670 --> 04:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
but this is a different circumstance if
 
04:51:43.350 --> 04:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
we're able to agree today or tomorrow
 
04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
before the deadline
 
04:51:46.948 --> 04:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
on a version of the bill
 
04:51:49.990 --> 04:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
that targets violent crime
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
and we allow the people that
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
are on the front lines of keeping our
 
04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
communities safe that opportunity to
 
04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
talk to the 400 members of the house
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
knowing that 21 of the senators are
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
going to support it i think you have
 
04:52:07.990 --> 04:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
very different dynamic and i think you
 
04:52:09.430 --> 04:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
should give it a shot
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:17.830 --> 04:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
the and you can ask the police folks
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
that are here
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
the bill that you think you can get past
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
you just said it in your own words
 
04:52:25.830 --> 04:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
you've watered it down to the point that
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't do very much
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
and it also i think senator whitley's
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
question was pretty appropriate
 
04:52:34.320 --> 04:52:35.190 align:start position:0%
question was pretty appropriate
um

04:52:35.190 --> 04:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
in the hearing of
 
04:52:39.080 --> 04:52:39.090 align:start position:0%
chief ho becky
 
04:52:39.090 --> 04:52:40.628 align:start position:0%
chief ho becky
[Music]

04:52:40.628 --> 04:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
she asked if the bill is not simply
 
04:52:45.510 --> 04:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
addressing those violent offenses but
 
04:52:48.230 --> 04:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
also victimless crimes and i don't think
 
04:52:50.628 --> 04:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do that but this is what
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
chief obecky said the language in your
 
04:52:55.990 --> 04:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill is quite broad and that that is why
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
the chief supported my bill 294
 
04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
as it specifically targets violent
 
04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders this could be
 
04:53:05.830 --> 04:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
problematic to the courts in terms of
 
04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
those engaged in non-violent misdemeanor
 
04:53:11.350 --> 04:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
level offenses being held for 36 hours
 
04:53:15.190 --> 04:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
i i think you should try to give
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
what we know is the biggest problem a
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
shot and give the police chiefs
 
04:53:26.470 --> 04:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
and those people that support safe homes
 
04:53:28.470 --> 04:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
and safe streets
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
a chance to talk to your 400 members if
 
04:53:33.670 --> 04:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
it fails it fails and then we have an
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
election this year but to say to
 
04:53:37.830 --> 04:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
substitute something that really doesn't
 
04:53:39.670 --> 04:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
do very much i don't know what we're
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
doing i do not know what we're doing in
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
the middle of a crime wave if we're not
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative barry um
 
04:53:53.270 --> 04:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
so you know there's some confusion on
 
04:53:54.868 --> 04:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
the on the chief of police side of it
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
because my chief of police came and
 
04:53:59.350 --> 04:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
testified in for favor of 1476 and in
 
04:54:01.110 --> 04:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
fact the chief of police were working
 
04:54:03.030 --> 04:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
chief association was working with me
 
04:54:05.270 --> 04:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
until it made it over to the senate um
 
04:54:07.190 --> 04:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
so there's some confusion there i
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
understand they produced a letter um but
 
04:54:11.590 --> 04:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
once again it comes back to the crux of
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
the argument of
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
they're not wrong we would i would love
 
04:54:16.310 --> 04:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
to do the violent crime part of it
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
they're not wrong it's just the votes
 
04:54:19.750 --> 04:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
just don't exist and we have the house
 
04:54:22.470 --> 04:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
has voted on similar thing a similar
 
04:54:25.190 --> 04:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
proposal from the senate and it died
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
three to one
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
to my dismay it died three to one the
 
04:54:31.030 --> 04:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
senate has never voted
 
04:54:33.030 --> 04:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
on 1476
 
04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
as we presented it as a whole it was
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
changed in committee and
 
04:54:40.070 --> 04:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
this 1476 came out of committee with
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
which i believe the the similar language
 
04:54:46.628 --> 04:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
in the house did not i believe it had no
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation it can't even get going
 
04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the body that is supposed to be most
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
attuned to this issue
 
04:54:53.600 --> 04:54:55.590 align:start position:0%
attuned to this issue
so

04:54:55.590 --> 04:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:57.430 --> 04:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
i just go back to
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
if we know the votes don't exist in the
 
04:55:00.150 --> 04:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
house and we know there's nothing we can
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
do about it and we've already voted on
 
04:55:03.430 --> 04:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
it two or three times something similar
 
04:55:04.868 --> 04:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
one and done
 
04:55:06.708 --> 04:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
what are we doing
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
we did not
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
the amendment that passed in the senate
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
was never voted on by the house what was
 
04:55:16.390 --> 04:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
tabled was not the language in the
 
04:55:18.070 --> 04:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
senate amendment that was
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's very different in that
 
04:55:22.310 --> 04:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
the senate language in 294
 
04:55:23.670 --> 04:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
was if you get arrested for any of those
 
04:55:25.590 --> 04:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
violent offenses that were listed and
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
they even included another offense that
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
04:55:30.150 --> 04:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
removed from the list
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
what that would do
 
04:55:33.830 --> 04:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
is there was a presumption that you were
 
04:55:35.350 --> 04:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
a danger in that there was a presumption
 
04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
that you would not get
 
04:55:39.430 --> 04:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
bail while being held awaiting trial and
 
04:55:40.868 --> 04:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
you could overcome that but that there
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
was an issue people had with the
 
04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
shifting of the burden
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
would i help but that that that that's
 
04:55:49.110 --> 04:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
one and done that the house i don't like
 
04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
it but they have rejected one and done
 
04:55:52.628 --> 04:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
but that's not what this the senate
 
04:55:53.910 --> 04:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is completely different what
 
04:55:56.310 --> 04:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
that does is is no presumption that
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get bail and be held
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
awaiting trial all it's saying is you're
 
04:56:03.110 --> 04:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
going in front of a judge not a bail
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner that is it if you commit if
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
you're charged with any of these 12
 
04:56:06.080 --> 04:56:07.270 align:start position:0%
you're charged with any of these 12
offenses

04:56:07.270 --> 04:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
04:56:09.270 --> 04:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
no bail commissioner judge that's it
 
04:56:11.830 --> 04:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
correct it's one is it one and done
 
04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
but i'm telling you what it would do no
 
04:56:14.948 --> 04:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
i understand what it will do i've read
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
it all
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
is it one and done
 
04:56:19.350 --> 04:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
is it a one and done system for any
 
04:56:22.070 --> 04:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
crime is it a one and done system it can
 
04:56:24.310 --> 04:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
be so the house the house is sh keeps
 
04:56:25.670 --> 04:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
shooting this down i don't like that
 
04:56:26.948 --> 04:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
they shoot it down i think if you hit
 
04:56:29.910 --> 04:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
your wife you should not get br bail i i
 
04:56:31.750 --> 04:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't know why the house can't get there
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
but it it can't
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
represent it's not this we're not
 
04:56:37.590 --> 04:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
discussing pr bail does it what it has
 
04:56:42.470 --> 04:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:43.830 --> 04:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
before we
 
04:56:46.230 --> 04:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
we we're gonna take a
 
04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.080 --> 05:17:21.090 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.090 --> 05:17:25.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:28.390 --> 05:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
this is this is your place no we're good
 
05:17:28.400 --> 05:17:29.750 align:start position:0%
this is this is your place no we're good
sir

05:17:29.750 --> 05:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
sir
 
05:17:36.010 --> 05:17:36.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:36.020 --> 05:17:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:17:48.470 --> 05:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.628 --> 05:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
across the street and state house
 
05:17:52.550 --> 05:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
wherever it i think it's that way
 
05:17:54.628 --> 05:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
yeah in the state house but don't forget
 
05:17:56.310 --> 05:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative they didn't meet they
 
05:17:58.470 --> 05:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
only met like one year out of the
 
05:17:58.480 --> 05:18:05.110 align:start position:0%
only met like one year out of the
biennium

05:18:05.110 --> 05:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know to be honest with you i
 
05:18:07.910 --> 05:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind that
 
05:18:10.788 --> 05:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
either but it would be a jam-packed
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
six months but people would have to
 
05:18:15.190 --> 05:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
exercise discipline and not file 30
 
05:18:15.200 --> 05:18:19.990 align:start position:0%
exercise discipline and not file 30
bills

05:18:19.990 --> 05:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:21.510 --> 05:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
well that that's what they told us to
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
sit so we're in your house we have to
 
05:18:30.390 --> 05:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:33.430 --> 05:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're now gonna reconvene the committee
 
05:18:36.470 --> 05:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
conference on hb 307.
 
05:18:39.670 --> 05:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh mr chairman um
 
05:18:42.470 --> 05:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the i think we are at an
 
05:18:44.948 --> 05:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
impasse the senate cannot go along with
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
the house version
 
05:18:50.230 --> 05:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
we could go along with including use but
 
05:18:52.868 --> 05:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
only under the conditions of
 
05:18:55.510 --> 05:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
defining public and private use and
 
05:18:57.750 --> 05:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we do not have the time to
 
05:18:59.590 --> 05:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
do that here
 
05:19:02.708 --> 05:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion is that
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming session this year
 
05:19:05.200 --> 05:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming session this year
that

05:19:06.070 --> 05:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:08.310 --> 05:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
we come back with a bill
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
that will define both public use and
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
private use
 
05:19:14.788 --> 05:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all for your time we
 
05:19:16.150 --> 05:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it it's always a
 
05:19:18.390 --> 05:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
pleasure uh
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
working with criminal justice committee
 
05:19:23.430 --> 05:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much
 
05:19:25.590 --> 05:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative burt
 
05:19:27.350 --> 05:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
used to make a comment thank you mr
 
05:19:29.590 --> 05:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senators um for
 
05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
what you just said
 
05:19:30.958 --> 05:19:32.150 align:start position:0%
what you just said
uh

05:19:32.150 --> 05:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:34.070 --> 05:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
and from what i understand that beau
 
05:19:37.110 --> 05:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
does have a carve out on some public
 
05:19:40.230 --> 05:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
land that does not allow shooting so
 
05:19:42.150 --> 05:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
that can happen if you want to address
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
that at some point
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
you know that was brought to my
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
attention today yes thank you thank you
 
05:19:50.230 --> 05:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
very much uh representative and i agree
 
05:19:52.868 --> 05:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
i think we can all see that this is not
 
05:19:55.270 --> 05:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
an easy issue it is
 
05:19:57.030 --> 05:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
fairly complex
 
05:19:58.868 --> 05:19:58.878 align:start position:0%
and we just do not have time in the
 
05:20:00.788 --> 05:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
committee conference in order to address
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
it to make sure that gun owners
 
05:20:07.110 --> 05:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
their rights are respected as well as
 
05:20:09.750 --> 05:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
the municipalities so i think this is
 
05:20:12.070 --> 05:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
going to be an ongoing process with more
 
05:20:14.070 --> 05:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
discussions in the upcoming legislative
 
05:20:15.830 --> 05:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
session and hopefully we're going to be
 
05:20:18.550 --> 05:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
able to resolve it next year
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
and lastly um it took me uh three terms
 
05:20:24.230 --> 05:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
to get my snowmobile bill passed and uh
 
05:20:26.390 --> 05:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
with your help this year it is going to
 
05:20:28.390 --> 05:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
the governor so i think i'm glad we
 
05:20:29.910 --> 05:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
could help we're glad we could help
 
05:20:31.830 --> 05:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
representatives things do take time yes
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
it does so thank you all again very very
 
05:20:36.150 --> 05:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
much for all your time and all your work
 
05:20:38.230 --> 05:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
we really appreciate it and we will look
 
05:20:40.470 --> 05:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
forward to hopefully working with all of
 
05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
you next year if i just may make one
 
05:20:44.548 --> 05:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
suggestion the issue of use i would i
 
05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
would recommend putting on a separate
 
05:20:47.590 --> 05:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
bill and let that
 
05:20:50.150 --> 05:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
yes let that have be its own discussion
 
05:20:52.390 --> 05:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i would agree things can get very
 
05:20:54.470 --> 05:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
confused in the house yes i agree i
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
think that is a good suggestion so again
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much
 
05:30:28.070 --> 05:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:29.990 --> 05:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
this at this time we'll now reconvene
 
05:30:33.510 --> 05:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
the committee conference on house bill
 
05:30:33.520 --> 05:30:37.030 align:start position:0%
the committee conference on house bill
1476

05:30:37.030 --> 05:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
and when i think what we're going to
 
05:30:40.230 --> 05:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
have to do is we're gonna recess until
 
05:30:43.110 --> 05:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
is there uh
 
05:30:47.350 --> 05:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
i hope everyone's available
 
05:30:47.360 --> 05:30:48.628 align:start position:0%
i hope everyone's available
sure

05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
maybe a representative you'll find
 
05:31:02.708 --> 05:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
all the voters in my district i think i
 
05:31:06.628 --> 05:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
speak for the chief here and most the
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
chiefs they want us to address fallen
 
05:31:10.788 --> 05:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
criminals and target them
 
05:31:13.670 --> 05:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
and they would like this past
 
05:31:15.750 --> 05:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
do we have the wrong house members maybe
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
we need a different body next fall if
 
05:31:20.070 --> 05:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
they're willing not to support this
 
05:31:22.548 --> 05:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
the senate version you can't even get
 
05:31:24.310 --> 05:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
the conversation out of the committee
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
never mind for a discussion on the house
 
05:31:28.788 --> 05:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
floor and then that's how bad then we
 
05:31:31.990 --> 05:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
have the wrong committee well
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
i did i no one will tell you that i
 
05:31:35.030 --> 05:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
didn't work my heart i i'm not saying
 
05:31:36.628 --> 05:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
anything okay so i
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
i get the horse the stream
