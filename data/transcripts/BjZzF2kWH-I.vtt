i represent
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
community bingo in manchester and arrow
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
international which is a bingo
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
products manufacturer the only concern
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
we have relative to the bill is for many
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
many years
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
we've had the limit of 10 games per
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
month which has
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
created a a paradigm where a commercial
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
gaming hall
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
bingo hall in new hampshire of which
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
there are 15 of them
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
can provide services to at least three
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
charities per month
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's about 30 days and 120 per a year
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
this bill right now is is is some
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences by pushing up to
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
16 opportunities per month for a bingo
 
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.509 align:start position:0%
16 opportunities per month for a bingo
event

00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
event
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
where we see the issue that a commercial
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
hall could then literally
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
only operate with two charities for the
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
32 days or the 30 days of the month
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
where the net unintended result would be
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
the elimination of certain charities in
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
commercial halls
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
i recognize there's uh an opportunity
 
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.110 align:start position:0%
i recognize there's uh an opportunity
for

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
seoul charities who see open dates and
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
open opportunities
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
to have additional dates but i we also
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to make the committee aware
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
that there is the possibility that by
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
increasing the
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
per charity day per month a commercial
 
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.389 align:start position:0%
per charity day per month a commercial
hall

00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
hall
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
who is interested in you know
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
efficiencies of operation can say to a
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
lower performing charity
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're only going to use two charities
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
for our hall
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
interestingly the charitable bingo halls
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
collect revenue on a
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
foot traffic paradigm meaning more
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
people show up at five dollars or
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
seven dollars a night that's where they
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
get the revenue charities perform at
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
different levels in commercial halls
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
charities uh really that have the
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
carryover coverall bingo games drawing
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
the most people
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
so a commercial bingo hall's best
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
interest would be to
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
service charities who bring them more
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
foot traffic
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
so it there are issues on both sides and
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
mr pham will tell his issues but i
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
wanted to commit to be aware that the
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh 10 events per month
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
as it exists today is more beneficial to
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
more charities across the state thank
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%

representative romney
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think i'm a
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
a little behind in what has happened to
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
regular bingo
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
in this state we don't hear about it
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
hardly at all anymore
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
um you're you're saying
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
that the main revenue is that the people
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
who want to play bingo
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
pay an entry fee
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
commercial bingo halls are by um
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
administrative rule their revenue comes
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
from the number of people
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
who go to the hall so when you open the
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
doors of the hall you have 100 people
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
the commercial bingo hall
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
their revenue source is the number of
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
so this is now in the rules no this is
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes it's in the rules but it's
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's the only revenue that a bingo hall
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
a commercial bingo hall
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
is allowed to collect the charity gets
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
the ma the revenue from lucky sevens
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
and from their percentage of the um the
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
take on the bingo game
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative

dear um hi my carrier very well thank
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
so i just want to understand is that
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
bingo bingo every time we come back to
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
bingo i get to
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
be re-educated uh we have the commercial
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
halls i know
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
even some charitable gaming locations
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
have bingo
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh but but this first you know
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
um the first
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
is bingo also occurring in in church
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
basement still
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
and uh and is this what this bill is
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
really trying to address
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
that and not the commercial locations uh
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
i would think so and i think that's the
 
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.509 align:start position:0%
i would think so and i think that's the
uh

00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
the dilemma you have to deal with in
 
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.550 align:start position:0%
the dilemma you have to deal with in
that

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
um a commercial bingo hall there are
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
standalone bingos uh there are bingos
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
operate in commercial halls where there
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
may be open nights
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh if you have a lower performing
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
commercial hall
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
that helen has 20 nights a month filled
 
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.910 align:start position:0%
that helen has 20 nights a month filled
up

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh that charity in that area might say
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
why can't i have
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
nights 12 13 and 14 to enhance my
 
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.269 align:start position:0%
nights 12 13 and 14 to enhance my
revenue

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
and that's a valid point but a high
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
performing commercial bingo hall may say
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
because of this bill i don't need
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
charities x and y that don't bring me
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
any people i'll take
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
charities a and b because they're
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
filling the hall every night
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i think is
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
important to remember bingo
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
is not a standalone product it's like a
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
loss leader for lucky seven sales so
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's bingo lucky seven
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
in addition the main driver of
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
attendance at commercial bingo halls is
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
the carryover coverall games
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
which are played once a night and can
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
have jackpots from 50 to 60 to 70
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
so a high performing charity that
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
creates a
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
large carryover coverall is going to
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
attract more foot traffic to the
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
commercial hall
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
but again this is i'm looking this is an
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
allowing every charity they have 16
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
um dates per month we had some
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
discussion in the senate about
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh individual charities being able to
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
petition the lottery and say hey
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
we've got open dates in our locale can
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
we have them
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh and i think that would be a better
 
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity than to
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
cut blanche give the 16
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh available dates to any charity that
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
wants to take them
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
a follow-up mr chair oh
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
so again mike i just want to understand
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
so i see that this
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
does impact the commercial halls but was
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
that the intent
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
to for this bill to really uh
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
cover the commercial halls no this
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
is this bill is not uh
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
was not put forth by the commercial
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
halls at all
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
we've had this bill in the past but this
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
that uh the commercial i represent
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
supports so it is not
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
a an effort by a commercial hall
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
to excise any charities it just happened
 
00:14:59.440 --> 00:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
to excise any charities it just happened
to

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
pop up because there's a situation a
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
missile phenomenon show
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
explain that his particular charity is
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
denied the opportunities to have extra
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
dates this is
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
not a charitable hall initiative but if
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
the church down the street decides to
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
have bingo night
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
i i looked this up just this morning so
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
it looks like the license fee per day
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
for a non-commercial location is 25
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
a day to have a license to do bingo
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming that that that still
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
exists that bingo could be played in
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
any location that's that you know pays
 
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.030 align:start position:0%
any location that's that you know pays
to

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria and pays the license
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
fee commercial halls play a license fee
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
of 250 a year
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh so so again i'm just trying to
 
00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.710 align:start position:0%
uh so so again i'm just trying to
understand

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
the intent to by which the senator was
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
here to understand that
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
i can reach out to the senator to
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
understand uh
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
was the intent to modify what the
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
charitable game
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
obviously he says i get no commercial
 
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.110 align:start position:0%
obviously he says i get no commercial
invoice

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
invoice
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
it looks like because it also increases
 
00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:20.829 align:start position:0%
it looks like because it also increases
the

00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh of games per
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
uh calendar month from 120 to 192.
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
so i i i'm just trying to divide out
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
commercial halls for all other bingo
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
that may be occurring um and i i'll i'll
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'll probably mr chair i'll probably
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
reach out to the prime sponsor to
 
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.749 align:start position:0%
reach out to the prime sponsor to
understand

00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
what the motivation was you have a good
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative romney thank you

saying and uh mr chairman
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not a bingo aficionado really
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
but i didn't understand what uh the
 
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.630 align:start position:0%
but i didn't understand what uh the
testifier

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
testifier
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
said about some sort of game that
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
is a once a night with a big pot
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
i didn't understand the word that he
 
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.150 align:start position:0%
i didn't understand the word that he
used

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's madame represented the
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
carryover coverall bingo yeah tell me
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
what that word is
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
carrie it sounds like carryover it's
 
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.510 align:start position:0%
carrie it sounds like carryover it's
well

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%

that are put forth are not all covered
 
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.390 align:start position:0%
that are put forth are not all covered
meaning

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%

00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
as well as myself i can continue
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you again um so the
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
spartans have been doing bingo since
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh as long as i can remember my
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
grandfather founded the organization
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh so i remember growing up and my
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
parents going off to
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
to work bingo and so we've been doing it
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
literally forever
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
um and this bill
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
comes uh as a request from me
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the spartans and symphony new
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire to both our senators down here
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
senator avard and rosenwald so
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
um i was very excited to have both of
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
them uh as co-sponsors of this bill
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
and the motivation uh on their part i
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
know that was a big concern of the
 
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
committee here
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
is uh very simple the spartans would
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
like to run more bingo
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
and um we think that um
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
the time has come to allow us to to do
 
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.230 align:start position:0%
the time has come to allow us to to do
that

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
um the the bill i know that a lot of a
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion has occurred this
 
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:06.549 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion has occurred this
morning

00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
it really is as simple as we want to go
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
from 10 dates a month
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
to 16 dates a month now
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
why is that um here in nashua
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
for example at the nashua bingo hall
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
which is a commercial hall
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
we have been closed on wednesdays
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
for about a year now why we've been
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
closed on wednesdays for about a year
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any charities
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
interested in taking on the
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.310 align:start position:0%
 
bingo

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
are you still there we can't hear you
 
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:49.590 align:start position:0%
are you still there we can't hear you
anymore

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
mr leflam we don't hear you
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
okay shoot can you hear me now yes all
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
right i apologize for that
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
not sure what happened but there's two
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
types of charities ones that do the
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
great walk-a-thons and the galas and
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
they have a large number of volunteers
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
that work for a short period of time on
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
a project then there's smaller charities
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
like the spartans
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
who have a smaller group of passionate
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
volunteers who are willing to do
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
one night or two nights a week on a more
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
specific type of project
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what we do and we're good at
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
it um so we would like to
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we would like to operate
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
on wednesdays at the national bingo hall
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
the idea that there is this pent-up
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
demand for charities that want to take
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
on the huge
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
task of running a bingo and that there's
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
like this waiting list to get into a
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
commercial hall
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
is just a false narrative it's not true
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
um if you were a commercial operator
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
i'm going to just ask you guys to think
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
about this for a second would it benefit
 
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.070 align:start position:0%
about this for a second would it benefit
you

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
to run a hall with two charities or
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
would it benefit you
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
to run a hall with seven charities
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
what if a charity went out of business
 
00:23:59.279 --> 00:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
what if a charity went out of business
your

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
you want to put more charities in your
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
hall have your eggs in more baskets
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
but you also want to be open so if you
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
can't find charities to operate
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be good to be able to use
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
your charities that you already have to
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
fill that need
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
the consequences of being closed on
 
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.669 align:start position:0%
the consequences of being closed on
wednesdays

00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
wednesdays
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
the hall owner has not collected any
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
rent has not collected that five dollars
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
ahead that mr mclaughlin spoke about so
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
so he's losing that revenue
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
there is a owner of the kitchen the
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
concession service who has been closed
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
he's not seen
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
any revenue the kitchen staff has not
 
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.470 align:start position:0%
any revenue the kitchen staff has not
received

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
you know wages for this period of time
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
because we're closed
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
and of course the spartans or any other
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
charity that might go in there has not
 
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.070 align:start position:0%
charity that might go in there has not
received

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
any um any of their profits
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh and quite frankly the spartans could
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
have used them in these tough covid
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
times not to mention the state of new
 
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.269 align:start position:0%
times not to mention the state of new
hampshire

00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
has not received any tax revenue now
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes i know there's been a mention of the
 
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.669 align:start position:0%
yes i know there's been a mention of the
25

00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
a night license fee as outlined in the
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
and that is true i would also point out
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
the state has not received the seven
 
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.470 align:start position:0%
the state has not received the seven
percent

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
tax on the winner take alls and the
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
carryover coveralls
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
which on an average night for the
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
spartans and i'm sure
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
there are charities with different types
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
of averages but on
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
um if the spartans had been operating
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
for that one extra night the state would
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
have generated during this time
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
frame roughly fifteen thousand dollars
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
in extra revenue
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
for doing nothing other than allowing us
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
to operate
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
um the the fiscal note talks about the
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
twenty five dollar per game date
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
as a as a possible consequence of of
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
it does not talk about the seven percent
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
tax using the same
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
logic that the fiscal note uses
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
multiplying by 200
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
which i don't think any charity is going
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
to um you know
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
use the maximum number of dates but
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's an extra 3.4 million dollars just
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
using the spartans averagings
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
so um the state has has a as an
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
interest in allowing this bill to go
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
forward as well
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
um the bill is um like i said very
 
00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:13.510 align:start position:0%
um the bill is um like i said very
simple

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
um please don't try to confuse it with
 
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.269 align:start position:0%
um please don't try to confuse it with
with

00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
foot traffic and carry over coveralls
 
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.390 align:start position:0%
foot traffic and carry over coveralls
and

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
the differences between the commercial
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
halls and in the church basement bingos
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
mr mclaughlin suggested there are 15
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
commercial halls
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
in the state uh multiply that by the
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
three charities required to
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
to run it that's 75 um
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh game dates the
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh the fiscal note talks about this 200
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
or i'm sorry 75 charities running in a
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
commercial bingo hall i meant to say
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal note talks about 200
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
charities running bingo at this time so
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's not the commercial halls are not
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
even half
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
of the bingo's running in the state so i
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
think that that's uh
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a herring that
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
is not even a consideration for this
 
00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:10.470 align:start position:0%
is not even a consideration for this
bill

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
but other than that i'm happy to answer
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
i have been doing bingo for way too long
 
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.070 align:start position:0%
i have been doing bingo for way too long
as

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
valerie king will testify to she would
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to get rid of me
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
um and um happy to answer any questions
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
 
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.710 align:start position:0%
representative romney followed by
representative

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr lefleum
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
i just want to understand the key thing
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure is that we're not
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
boxing out any charities that uh
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
already have dates uh so
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
your testimony says that that's not
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
going to happen because
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
all the dates aren't taken but you're
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
saying it's only closed on a wednesday
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to reconcile that if it's
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
only closed on a wednesday
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
i could see it being closed one
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
wednesday a week because
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
at the current roll maximum of 10 days
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's 30 days in our 31 day
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
month one day have to have to be closed
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh but it says no more than 10 days and
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
this would be no more than 16 days
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
here's my his my question really is who
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
controls the dates is it is
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
your like your facility in nashua that
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
you utilize
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
do they control the dates that they give
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
to different charities to do this
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
so we have a lease with the hall owner
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
that at least states that we
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
um can operate on certain dates and we
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
agree to that now you can't just take
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
them away without breaking the lease
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
the reason why there is a disconnect
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
between the number of dates
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
and and um that are allowed and the
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
closed on wednesdays in practice
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
charities typically pick
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
one day a week to run their game so like
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
the spartans do mondays and tuesdays
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
so and that has to do with um
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
lucky seven bonuses and you don't wanna
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
you don't wanna use your lucky seven
 
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.230 align:start position:0%
you don't wanna use your lucky seven
bonuses

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
bonuses
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
that you develop over time on a monday
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
and then give them away to your
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
to uh somebody that might win it on a
 
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.430 align:start position:0%
to uh somebody that might win it on a
wednesday

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
um the players get upset about that
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
because they feel that's their money et
 
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.750 align:start position:0%
because they feel that's their money et
cetera

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
cetera
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
um so so typically we do just
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
one day a week so obviously with 10 days
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
currently allowed
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
some months have five mondays and five
 
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.590 align:start position:0%
some months have five mondays and five
tuesdays

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
tuesdays
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
so i've maxed out other months might
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
have only
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
four mondays and five tuesdays so i only
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
get to do
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
nine dates that month just because of
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
the logistics
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
of the way a day of the week works
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
because there's only one wednesday in
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
the week obviously
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
um so this would allow a charity to do
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
um you know in my case a monday a
 
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:50.710 align:start position:0%
um you know in my case a monday a
tuesday

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
and a wednesday there may be some weeks
 
00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:54.789 align:start position:0%
and a wednesday there may be some weeks
where

00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
or some months rather that we can't do
 
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.070 align:start position:0%
or some months rather that we can't do
all

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh you might ask why is there 16 and not
 
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.110 align:start position:0%
uh you might ask why is there 16 and not
15

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
15
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
well that's to to cover um
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in the calendar where you
 
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520 align:start position:0%

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
more more date more mondays more
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%

will church bingos be able to move up or

number
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
now they would be able to move up to 16
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%

00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
waiting list to get in
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
bingo is different the charities run the
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
games themselves a bonafide member needs

members my name is valerie king with new
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire lottery
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'm here to answer any questions you
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
have i think paul did a great job
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
explaining it but i
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
i can answer any additional questions
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh mom yeah representative romney i
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't find my
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
my hand button here so um
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:36.410 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
uh so
[Music]

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
so just want to make sure we understand
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
so this this affects both
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
the the church charities as well as the
 
00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:45.350 align:start position:0%
the the church charities as well as the
the

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh the halls is that correct
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct and
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh so it is different than terrible
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
gaming it sounds
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
like in terms of how did how the dates
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
are controlled is that correct
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify uh bingo is a
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
charitable game
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
i think you're referring to games of
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
chance um are
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
poker rooms and yes it's totally
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
different regulations totally different
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
set of uh rules and
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
right uh last question um
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
is is there a backlog of charities that
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
want to get involved or not
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're not aware of any waiting lists um
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
we don't maintain a waiting list but we
 
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:29.990 align:start position:0%
we don't maintain a waiting list but we
haven't

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
received any complaints i'm not aware of
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
any complaints of
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
charities not being able to play bingo
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:44.510 align:start position:0%
any further questions for
 
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.149 align:start position:0%
any further questions for
[Music]

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
mrs kim yes
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
personally thank you mr chairman
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
on do we
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
is there if there are very few uh
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
charities that
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
want to sponsor bingo is there
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
really a reason why we are limiting
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
then what is the reasoning for limiting
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
the number of days
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
at this point and i have another
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
question about the
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
so i i can't speak to the uh original
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
intent of the
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
ten game dates per month maya some i
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
mean this this
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation goes back to when i was
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
in high school and probably before
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
which was a long time ago um but i i
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
would assume that it had to do with
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
bingo used to be a much more popular
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
game um so they probably did need to
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
limit it at that time
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
it has been a dying game there
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
it's it's shrinking in size the number
 
00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
it's it's shrinking in size the number
of

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
of charities willing to do it and
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
whatnot so
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
um i don't believe that there's a need
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
to put that cap
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and the other question
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
senior centers our senior center does
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
penny ante penny bingo actually
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
penny a card on how are
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
they regulated at this point
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
um depending upon how they actually run
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
their games they may be exempt
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
there are senior bingos that are exempt
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
they have to follow certain criteria but
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
they are exempt thank you that would be
 
00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.030 align:start position:0%
they are exempt thank you that would be
them

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
saying none do we have anybody else
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
janine not that i can see thank you
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to close the public
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
hearing on senate bill 139-fs
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
the next public hearing has to do with
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
101-fn an act
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
increasing the minimum gross business
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
income required for filing a
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
and senator sosi
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor and
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
question i don't see senator soucy but
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
then uh well i don't really like senator
 
00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:52.829 align:start position:0%
then uh well i don't really like senator
bradley

00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.839 --> 00:36:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair i think i
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
had signed on for senate bill three but
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
since senator associates not here
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
i believe senate bill 101 is a bill that
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
lifts the threshold
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
on filing the business profits tax from
 
00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:18.870 align:start position:0%
on filing the business profits tax from
50

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
to 75 000 and as i recall
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
it passed the senate unanimously and we
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
commend it to you
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
and i just promoted uh senator soucy
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm the prime sponsor of
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
senate bill 101 i represent senate
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
district 18 which is manchester's
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
wards 5 through 9 in the town of
 
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.630 align:start position:0%
wards 5 through 9 in the town of
litchfield

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
litchfield
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is a bill to increase
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
the threshold for filing a business
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
profits tax return
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
the current threshold is gross business
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
income in excess
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
of fifty thousand dollars this bill
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
would raise that threshold
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
to gross business income in excess of
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
seventy five
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
thousand 000 and it would apply to the
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
taxable period beginning
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
after december 31st 2021
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
the bill would take effect on july 1st
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
of 2021.
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
um most importantly though i think the
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee should be aware
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
the current limit was set in 1993.
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
it has been 27 years and i believe
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
that we should be increasing the
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
threshold at the very least to keep up
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
with inflation
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
but i also think it's critical that we
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
look at these thresholds
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
particularly during these times because
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
the increase of the threshold would lift
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
a regulatory burden off
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
so many of our small businesses and sole
 
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.430 align:start position:0%
so many of our small businesses and sole
proprietorships

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
proprietorships
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
reduce administrative costs and also
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
reduce accounting fees for so many of
 
00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:08.310 align:start position:0%
reduce accounting fees for so many of
them

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
the department has included a fiscal
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
note as you can see it is based on some
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
data from 2018
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
but it does show that even using those
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
numbers thousands of ben
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
businesses would benefit from increasing
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
this threshold and i would
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to vote ought to
 
00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:28.390 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to vote ought to
pass

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
this was a bill that was unanimously
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
voted upon
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
in the senate last year uh it has been
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
unanimous again
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
this year so it certainly has bipartisan
 
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.470 align:start position:0%
this year so it certainly has bipartisan
support

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
and as i said i would encourage you to
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
vote out to pass would be happy to
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
answer any questions mr chairman
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you senator um
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee hold on
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
a second
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
my question senator susie
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh when the senate uh discussed this did
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
they discuss
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
raising it even higher because you
 
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.630 align:start position:0%
raising it even higher because you
mentioned

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh keeping pace with inflation and i
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
don't disagree that
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
75 000 is a nice move but
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
why was not uh 100 125 or 150 considered
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh or did it even come up in the senate
 
00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.950 align:start position:0%
uh or did it even come up in the senate
discussions

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am thank you representative
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
already um
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
the question of whether to raise it even
 
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.670 align:start position:0%
the question of whether to raise it even
beyond

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
that did not come up um in the
 
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.430 align:start position:0%
that did not come up um in the
conversation

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh i think it certainly if you were to
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
raise it
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
beyond the 75 would once again encompass
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
many more businesses therefore it may
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
have an additional cost associated with
 
00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:50.630 align:start position:0%
have an additional cost associated with
it

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
but the question of a hundred thousand
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
or 125 was not debated
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
um in the senate ways and means
 
00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.270 align:start position:0%
um in the senate ways and means
committee

00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
any further questions um
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
yes yes represent yes mr chair
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
you have a fall follow up please yes
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh senator susie do you think your uh
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
your committee or the senate as a whole
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
would be adverse to raising the 75 to
 
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.950 align:start position:0%
would be adverse to raising the 75 to
100

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh talking with several uh accounting
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
firms and they
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
they think that uh uh an even higher uh
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
filing limit would be advantageous based
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
upon the amount of taxes
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
or paperwork that they file that for no
 
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.349 align:start position:0%
or paperwork that they file that for no
benefit

00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
because no taxes are due would that be
 
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.990 align:start position:0%
because no taxes are due would that be
considered

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative thanks again for the
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
question uh personally
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes i would be open to that
 
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.670 align:start position:0%
uh yes i would be open to that
consideration

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
would of course want to consult with the
 
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.670 align:start position:0%
would of course want to consult with the
department

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
to determine the impact but i think
 
00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.030 align:start position:0%
to determine the impact but i think
that's

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
a possibility that would be entertained
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you senator susie
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%

00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
to speak here today my name is greg
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
and we fully support senate bill 101
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
believe it's good policy
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
as a fiscal note demonstrates uh over 86
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
percent of the businesses that filed
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
that fell
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
into this range had a tax liability of
 
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.829 align:start position:0%
into this range had a tax liability of
zero

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
meaning that uh that's over four
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
thousand different
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh entities had to go and get their
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
taxes prepared
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
but had no tax liability which obviously
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
creates a deadweight cost for each of
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
those small businesses
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
and beyond that as uh as
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
senator susie pointed out this uh this
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh current limit of fifty thousand
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
dollars has been in place since 1993.
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
i did a check and based
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
on data from the bureau of labor
 
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.030 align:start position:0%
on data from the bureau of labor
statistics

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
the consumer price index has increased
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
by 83
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
so this 50 percent increase is
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
beneficial certainly uh and would
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
certainly help a lot of small businesses
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
as well as as well as reduce some of the
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
administrative burden not at the
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
department level
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
it still doesn't quite keep up with
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
inflation i think that that uh
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
one prospect that we might ask the
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
committee to consider is something
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
similar to what we did in uh house bill
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
1418 back in 2012
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
where in addition to raising the
 
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.470 align:start position:0%
where in addition to raising the
threshold

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
what we did for the bet we also indexed
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
it for inflation
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
so uh i would ask the committee that we
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
fully support the bill as it stands
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh we would fully support the bill at a
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
higher level uh but we
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
think that maybe adding an an inflation
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
index to it
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
going forward similar to what we did
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
with uh with the bet
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be a positive step uh i will say
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
that that uh this legislation was
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh as senator susie mentioned was
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
initially filed
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 and it was filed at the
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar level
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
not the not the seventy five thousand
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
dollar level and the senate
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
upon passing it in a senate ways it
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
means we scaled it back from a hundred
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
thousand two seventy five thousand
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh so maybe uh if you get a chance to
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
talk to one of your colleagues
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh over at the senate ways and means who
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
is serving in the last term they might
 
00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:58.710 align:start position:0%
is serving in the last term they might
be

00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
able to offer you some ideas or guidance
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
as to why they
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
they in fact scale it back from a
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand to seventy five
 
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:05.910 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand to seventy five
thousand

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd be happy to take any
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um mr moore what was
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
that uh uh bill that you uh
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
referenced with the uh inflation index
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
attached please
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
sure it was house bill 1418 from 2012
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
the 2012
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
session uh which uh obviously
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
serving as the house chief of staff at
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
the time i was taking a keen interest in
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
um and that was a bill that not only
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
raised the limit
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
for raise a limit on the bet for filing
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
threshold but also
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
index it for inflation uh thank you mr
 
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.150 align:start position:0%
index it for inflation uh thank you mr
moore

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein thank you mr
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
good morning mr moore nice to see your
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
name at least
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
as not your face um
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
you had testified that over 86 of the
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
businesses that filed within the range
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
of 50 000 to 75 000 first revenue had
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
zero tax liability
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
do you have numbers on if it if that
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
threshold were
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
increased to a hundred thousand uh
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
what percentage of businesses would
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
still have a zero liability
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
i don't i i i suspect what i would do is
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
go back and look at the
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
the initial fiscal note uh from the
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that was introduced in 2018.
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
i believe it was senator ditch who
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
was the prime sponsor of that
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
legislation uh
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
what i might refer you to go back and
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
and review maybe that fiscal note that
 
00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.270 align:start position:0%
and review maybe that fiscal note that
might

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
might offer a substantial amount of
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
guidance good idea thank you very much
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
mr moore i don't see any
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
soul representation thank you mr
 
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
soul representation thank you mr
chairman

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative elmi uh city of
 
00:47:46.559 --> 00:47:47.829 align:start position:0%
uh representative elmi uh city of
lebanon

00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
lebanon
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
on i and you were in
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
in and i think representative hollery
 
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:54.870 align:start position:0%
in and i think representative hollery
were

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
also on the committee in 12
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
2012. and uh
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to talk about the indexing
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
which is something that i had suggested
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
when that bill came through
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
on we had a situation where we'd had 100
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
inflation i think at that point since
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
the time that that one had been
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
been done and um there was a bill
 
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.150 align:start position:0%
been done and um there was a bill
brought

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
brought
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
in to increase the threshold by that
 
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.589 align:start position:0%
in to increase the threshold by that
amount

00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
and i thought wow that's a lot and i
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
went back and i can't i
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
calculated it there had been a lot more
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
inflation that
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
that decade and um
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
it was on it was just it was just a
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
little bit below 100
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
at that point for um
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
since the bt threshold had been
 
00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.670 align:start position:0%
since the bt threshold had been
established

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
and on it did cost us a fair amount of
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
money to do that
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
at that point in the revenues so um i
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
suggested and everybody else thought it
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
was a good idea that we
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
index on that threshold
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
so that we would not get sudden
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
changes in our revenues due to
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
to changing the threshold as we went
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
and on i was
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
i forget whether i was on the bill or
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
not last night
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
last term but on
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
it did uh get considered in the senate
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i was following it
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
and they did um
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
they did look at the number of people
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
that would be exempted by
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
changing it up to a hundred and decide
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
that and the amount of money involved
 
00:49:45.599 --> 00:49:46.549 align:start position:0%
that and the amount of money involved
was

00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
too much for the budget at that point
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
and um take it down to 75
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't have the precise numbers
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
here but the dra would have them
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
and they could do a recalculation as
 
00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:01.030 align:start position:0%
and they could do a recalculation as
well

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
of of how many people get exempted i
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
believe one of the problems
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
is that if you exempt up to a high
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
enough level
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
you encourage people to fudge
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
fudge their books you don't catch the
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
people that should be paying
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure about that
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative major there's a hand
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
raised in the attendees
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh henry ville i'm not sure if i
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
any any questions for representing all
 
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:48.710 align:start position:0%
any any questions for representing all
me

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
i don't say any so we'll let henry
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
come in um
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
and he just lowered his hand so never
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
mind i guess
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
sorry i just wish to testify
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
for or against senate bill
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
101. the sign up sheet that i have here
 
00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.750 align:start position:0%
101. the sign up sheet that i have here
there's

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
16 that signed up in support five
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
and i believe everybody has a copy of
 
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.710 align:start position:0%
and i believe everybody has a copy of
the

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note quick guide which
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
cost the state of approximately one and
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
carolyn just raised her hand i'll
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
carolyn as all yours do you have
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
anything to say on
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
senate bill 101 or
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
when people suggest that maybe you wrote
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
representatives this is carolyn lehrer
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner at the department
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
of revenue
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
um i we don't have any testimony to
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
offer you today about this bill
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative major as the screen
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
was refreshing as i was promoted i think
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
i caught the end of your question
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
which was relative to whether we had a
 
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.670 align:start position:0%
which was relative to whether we had a
recommendation

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
um with respect to either the hundred
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
thousand or
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
the indexing we certainly don't have a
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation but those are
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
both um changes that we could administer
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
here at the department
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
um if you do desire to go either
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
with a higher threshold or with indexing
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
what the penalty would be going from
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
75 to 100 where
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
cost that revenue about one and a half
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
at the 75 000 level but it might be
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's a hundred thousand so i we don't
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
have an
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
updated analysis for that but i do have
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
in front of me the analysis that we did
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
for senator um then senator diege's
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
bill in 2019 which used
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
2016 data and we estimated the fiscal
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
impact of going to a hundred thousand at
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
about 2.2 million but we could certainly
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
update that analysis
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
um with 2018 data so that you could
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
compare it to the
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh the fiscal note that you have for
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
senate bill 101
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
any questions for the dra
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
sorry i wonder whether when you do the
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
analysis of the difference between
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
seventy five thousand
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
and a hundred thousand you could choose
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
a point
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
in the middle so that if there's some
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
desire to compromise we would know
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
what the effect was of that compromise
 
00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.829 align:start position:0%
what the effect was of that compromise
point

00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
eighty five thousand ninety thousand
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
but i can just envision are you really
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
would have the number but it wouldn't be
 
00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.950 align:start position:0%
would have the number but it wouldn't be
available

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
while you're doing the analysis could
 
00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.030 align:start position:0%
while you're doing the analysis could
you

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
come up with a in between point and know
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
the effect of that
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
we can do that we'll we'll do 85 unless
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering how difficult would
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
it be to administer
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
and indexed you know if we did go to an
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
indexed situation
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm thinking that do you think it
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
would cause a lot more
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
errors on people that were potentially
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
using last year's
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
um you know i know a lot of times when i
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
i use
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
i do my taxes i look at last year's as
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
kind of a guide not that i
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
trust every i look to see what's changed
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
but i would imagine others do that as
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
well do you do you think that we'd have
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
a lot more
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
people making errors by not just having
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
a set
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
number as opposed to indexing
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative we already indexed the
 
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.109 align:start position:0%
representative we already indexed the
bet

00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
bet
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
threshold every two years um so i think
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think there would be any
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
additional errors if we matched the bpt
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't have an answer for you as to
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
the changing threshold for the bet every
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
two years is currently
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
causing errors although i suspect
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
um that given technology
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
and the um the companies that produce
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
electronically submitted
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
returns that for the most part it
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
is automated for taxpayers meaning
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
they don't have to look it up at all the
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
form is programmed
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any further questions for
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
mrs lear the ra representative rodney
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh thank you uh
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
miss lair um
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for reminding us that the
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
index is every two years for the uh
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
bet so if we were to do this would it be
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
easier for you to manage if we did the
 
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.870 align:start position:0%
easier for you to manage if we did the
same

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
instead of making it every year make it
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
every other year uh
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
melissa can jump in because she act if
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
she would like to because she actually
 
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:20.630 align:start position:0%
she would like to because she actually
does

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
the calculation um if she disagrees but
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
i think the easiest thing for us would
 
00:57:25.359 --> 00:57:26.069 align:start position:0%
i think the easiest thing for us would
be

00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
to simply match the schedule that we
 
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:29.990 align:start position:0%
to simply match the schedule that we
currently

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
have for the bet which is updating
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
every two years we would simply do them
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
both at the same time
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
i just promoted melissa
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
yes good morning members of the
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee melissa rollins department of
 
00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:50.470 align:start position:0%
committee melissa rollins department of
revenue

00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
um i was rejoining so i didn't fully
 
00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.589 align:start position:0%
um i was rejoining so i didn't fully
hear

00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
carolyn's answer on us um being promoted
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
but i'm thinking i'm saying the exact
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
same thing as her i don't think it would
 
00:58:00.799 --> 00:58:01.109 align:start position:0%
same thing as her i don't think it would
be

00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
an issue um i think it's much easier if
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
we do do it in sync with the bpt
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
just because um you're not changing
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
thresholds on different you're
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
changing them all at the same time
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
probably easier for taxpayers
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
and easier for us as well to make sure
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
that those are
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
in sync and updated at the same time
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
every other year
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
are you all set representative romney
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
saying nothing does anybody else
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
want to testify for or against senate
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
no raise hands then i'm closing the
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
take a quick five-minute break before we
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
go to the next public hearing
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.839 --> 01:02:04.829 align:start position:0%
 
break

01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.839 --> 01:05:06.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:20.829 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:05:20.839 --> 01:05:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%

01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
everybody back
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%

an act clarifying the tax treatment of
 
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.470 align:start position:0%
an act clarifying the tax treatment of
federal

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor is senator bradley
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
senator bradley it's yours to introduce
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be before you today for the
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
record jeb bradley
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
from wolfeboro the senate
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
passed this bill about a month ago on a
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan vote
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
of 23-0 with one member
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
not participating due to a conflict of
 
01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.710 align:start position:0%
not participating due to a conflict of
interest

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is to clarify
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
and to make it consistent with federal
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
statute that the payroll protection
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
program was not deemed to be a taxable
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
event the federal government has
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
adopted that policy that it's not a
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
taxable event
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i believe and the senate concurs
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire should not make this
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
a taxable event either
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
payroll protection was designed and
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
it did a good job quite frankly of
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
keeping the economy afloat
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic when our state and
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
our nation face significant
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
as you recall new hampshire's
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate skyrocketed to above
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
15 percent
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
thankfully we are back at 3 percent now
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
and i think a
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
large measure of that was the impact of
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
the payroll protection program
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
businesses could keep people on their
 
01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:57.270 align:start position:0%
businesses could keep people on their
payroll

01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
and not overburden our unemployment but
 
01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:00.630 align:start position:0%
and not overburden our unemployment but
also

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
it allowed the payment of mortgage
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
interest it kept loans
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
performing rent was able to be paid by
 
01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:07.910 align:start position:0%
performing rent was able to be paid by
businesses

01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
utilities all of this helped prop up the
 
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.950 align:start position:0%
utilities all of this helped prop up the
economy

01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
let's remember mr chairman who
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
did the payroll protection program
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
primarily benefit well it was targeted
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
to companies of 500 and fewer employees
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
so the largest businesses around our
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
country and in new hampshire
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
were never eligible and they are some of
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
the largest business profits tax
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in terms of their overall
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
business profits
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
tax receipts senate bill 3 does not
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
affect them
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
and given the strong business tax
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
revenue i think that
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
we would probably all agree that these
 
01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:50.229 align:start position:0%
we would probably all agree that these
companies

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
for the most part seem to be performing
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
fairly well
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
our business tax revenue is
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
significantly ahead
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 21. i also think you can't
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
just look at the businesses that the
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
payroll protection program helped
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
you have to look at the thousands and
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of jobs
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
of hard-working men and women across our
 
01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:15.030 align:start position:0%
of hard-working men and women across our
state

01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
who are better able to withstand the
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
impact of the pandemic and the economic
 
01:09:20.159 --> 01:09:21.749 align:start position:0%
impact of the pandemic and the economic
ravages

01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
ravages
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
congress has made it clear that the
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
payroll protection plan was never
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
intended as i said before
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
to be taxable and i think new hampshire
 
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:31.829 align:start position:0%
to be taxable and i think new hampshire
should

01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
also make it clear that the payroll
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
protection program
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
is meant to protect businesses and
 
01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.269 align:start position:0%
is meant to protect businesses and
employees

01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
not to become the payroll taxation
 
01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:45.269 align:start position:0%
not to become the payroll taxation
program

01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the issue is
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
we are tied to the 2018 irs
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
code not the 2020 code and so
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
that's why the department of revenue has
 
01:09:57.679 --> 01:09:58.709 align:start position:0%
that's why the department of revenue has
determined

01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that we are tied to
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
the 2018 code
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
that it is a taxable event so that's
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
why we need senate bill 3.
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
we also have to look at what's happening
 
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:12.790 align:start position:0%
we also have to look at what's happening
around

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country there are 35
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
states that clearly
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
do not tax the payroll protection plans
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
there are four other
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
states that either don't allow it to
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
begin with or
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
it is mostly not taxed and so there are
 
01:10:28.239 --> 01:10:28.830 align:start position:0%
it is mostly not taxed and so there are
11

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
11
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
states only in new england vermont
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
along with new hampshire has deemed that
 
01:10:35.199 --> 01:10:36.630 align:start position:0%
along with new hampshire has deemed that
it's

01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
taxable and i think it's
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
vitally important not only to protect
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
the businesses
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
that had to withstand the ravages of the
 
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.390 align:start position:0%
that had to withstand the ravages of the
pandemic

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
but also the message that it sends
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
to businesses that are contemplating
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
locating in new hampshire
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
expanding in new hampshire staying in
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have done a lot over the last five or
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
six years to make
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire more competitive lower
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
workers compensation rates
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
lower business taxation rates we've
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
tried to address and i think we are
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
making progress on things like
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing that make it possible
 
01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
affordable housing that make it possible
to

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
attract employees into new hampshire
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
the last thing that we want to do is
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
send a message
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the live free or die state that while
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
washington has determined
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a taxable event that we on the
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
other hand
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
will make it a taxable event so
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
i believe that for all of the reasons
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
above that's why
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
um we had a 23 to zero vote
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
totally bipartisan obviously on
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
quite frankly what's a very big issue in
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and one that
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
could engender
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
controversy but senators came together
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
across the spectrum to say
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we protect
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire businesses so thank you
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i would uh
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions good um
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
first it would be representative
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
schamberg followed by
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
senator uh representative schamberg here
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm having just a little hard time
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
understanding if senate bill 3 passes
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
ppa loans will not be included in the bp
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
tax base that i understand
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
so why should business expenses paid for
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
with pp
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
loans loan amounts remain
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
deductible when they filed taxes
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
can you um i mean business expenses
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
has always been deductible the fact is
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
that when congress authorized the
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
payroll protection plan as part of the
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
cares act
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
it was never determined to be a taxable
 
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.270 align:start position:0%
it was never determined to be a taxable
event

01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
event
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
in washington so because
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
as i explained our code is tied to the
 
01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
as i explained our code is tied to the
2018

01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
irs code not the 2020 code
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's what makes it a taxable event and
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
and if we want to
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
a hurt you know businesses with
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
a very significant tax and remember it's
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
the 500
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
or fewer employee businesses not the
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
largest businesses but
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the main street businesses
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think not only would we be hurting the
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
lifeblood of the new hampshire economy
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
but we'd also be sending a message
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire is undermining its
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
competitiveness on a national scale
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
and as we're trying to recover from the
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic that's not a good
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh good message to send to
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
businesses in our state and around the
 
01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:03.350 align:start position:0%
businesses in our state and around the
country

01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i got there i got it unmuted
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh senator bradley good morning and
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
putting forward this much needed bill
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
um essentially
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
i have an a related question to the bill
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's closely related
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh essentially this bill conforms
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's approach to the federal
 
01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.750 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's approach to the federal
approach

01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government has taken the
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
lead on this they've created
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
the ppp loan program and as a part
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i'd say an integral part of that
 
01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.550 align:start position:0%
and i'd say an integral part of that
program

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
they've they've established the exempt
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
exemption for the forgiven loans and the
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
expenses that go along with that
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
and uh that's the way it is for a not
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
a state that doesn't conform
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
automatically like new hampshire
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
and we're in a minority i think
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
nationwide on that score
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
it requires an affirmative decision and
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
the the question that i
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
get to is whether well
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
one other context point is that the cost
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
of doing this
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
seems to be rising almost as we speak
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
through the estimating process the dra
 
01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.669 align:start position:0%
through the estimating process the dra
estimate

01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
that came out the revised fiscal note
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
has put it at 91 million dollars i think
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
um and i i have questions perhaps
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
many of us do about that estimate but
 
01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.630 align:start position:0%
many of us do about that estimate but
that's

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
putting that aside it's significant
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
money the
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
question that i get to is
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
the grant money that's coming to us from
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government through
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
arpa which is significant
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
maybe 900 million dollars or so and
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's a tax cuts provision
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
is a limiting factor for states if they
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
cut taxes then
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh pouring money federal harper money in
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
to fill the hole
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
is something that in some way
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
is forbidden and what that way is is
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
being explored by treasury
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
as we speak but
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
treasury has just issued a guidance
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
maybe two weeks ago
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
that tells us that this provision
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be different where a state
 
01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:51.750 align:start position:0%
is going to be different where a state
chooses

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
chooses
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
to conform this is my understanding
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
conform to the arpa
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
not harper the ppp approach to
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
tax exemption in other words to update
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
its irc code
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
effectively cutting taxes for at the
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
state level for our firms
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
that have received ppe loans
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
that that's okay that doesn't trigger
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
the tax cuts provision
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
and my question to you is whether you've
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
had occasion to look at this question
 
01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:26.790 align:start position:0%
had occasion to look at this question
and

01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
whether my understanding is correct
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
essentially that if new hampshire
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
chooses to
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
take some of that pp that arka money
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
and steer it to fill the hole created
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
whatever that hole is created by
 
01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:46.390 align:start position:0%
whatever that hole is created by
conformity

01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
conformity
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
that that would be okay to do
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
and it'll be a choice that new hampshire
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
could make without worrying about
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
being penalized for doing it
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
so let me just um thank you very much uh
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
um i would just say a couple of things
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
in looking at the fiscal estimate
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
it has changed um a couple of times the
 
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
it has changed um a couple of times the
first

01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note had a range of 80 million to
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
135 million
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
um a subsequent fiscal note i believe
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
had a
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
low range of 65 million and now
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
the most recent fiscal note um
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult as i'm sure
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
dra will testify to the exact um
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
you know magnitude of what might happen
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
if we pass senate bill three
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
but let me just say again it's a tax
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
increase if we pass senate bill three
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
i i judge from your question you agree
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
with that and agree with
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
um the fact that um you know we should
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
not be doing it
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
now i i'm like you and i think everybody
 
01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
now i i'm like you and i think everybody
else

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire waiting for that final
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
treasury guidance
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
on the 1.9 trillion dollar
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
stimulus bill that the president
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
recently signed
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
and congress enacted um i i think it's
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
safe to say and i i'd take a slightly
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
different approach
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
if we're the 40th state at a minimum
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
to say we're not going to tax um
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
the payroll protection plan proceeds
 
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
i can't see any way that
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government would trigger the
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
provision that was put in
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
the recent stimulus bill
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
um and and override that i think with 40
 
01:19:49.679 --> 01:19:50.390 align:start position:0%
um and and override that i think with 40
states

01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire becomes the 40th state
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
that debate is um long over in terms of
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh what the treasury guidance will say
 
01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
uh what the treasury guidance will say
in

01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of other you know taxation
 
01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:04.310 align:start position:0%
in terms of other you know taxation
issues

01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up follow-up
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
and just really to essentially agree
 
01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:16.790 align:start position:0%
and just really to essentially agree
with

01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
senator bradley on this um i think that
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh that by my reading of
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
the statement put out by treasury they
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
have jumped the gun on this particular
 
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:27.910 align:start position:0%
have jumped the gun on this particular
provision

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
probably for the very reason that you've
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
just set out
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
that some 30 40 states have already
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh essentially conformed either
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
automatically or by choice
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
and it would make no sense to
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
say oops you know you're gonna you're
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
gonna pay a penalty under
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
the money for doing that it just doesn't
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
make sense and so they've
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
i believe they've made it clear maybe
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
somebody some people will disagree in
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
their interpretation of that statement
 
01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:57.830 align:start position:0%
their interpretation of that statement
but

01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
so we're going down that road and then
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's the remaining question here in
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
the state of what to do with that harp
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
of money and
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh and maybe it would be to fill
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
um to use part of it to fill this hole
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm open to that i i trust uh
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
you would be uh yeah obviously i think
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
again um you know businesses
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
that have survived the pandemics um
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
now's not the time to
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know switch gears on them and say
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government has said it's not
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
a taxable event but in the live free or
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
die state
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
we think it is i think um
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know we need to make sure that we've
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
done everything to
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
help businesses get through this and
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
continue to get through it i think
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
does that and i thank you for your
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you senator
 
01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:11.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you senator
bradley

01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
bradley
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
um so yes the the latest fiscal note is
 
01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:16.990 align:start position:0%
um so yes the the latest fiscal note is
uh

01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
91.7 uh million
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh from the dra but then we got some
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
guidance this morning that
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
because uh they said that uh
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
of the what's remaining in the second
 
01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:30.790 align:start position:0%
of the what's remaining in the second
draw

01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
draw
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
which was passed in december and ends on
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
may 31st
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh was 290 billion potential loans
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i guess already 240 billion have
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
already been awarded so
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
but only 50 billion so
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh that could be awarded so that that
 
01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.950 align:start position:0%
uh that could be awarded so that that
91.7

01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
91.7
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
midpoint i would assume of the dras
 
01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.070 align:start position:0%
midpoint i would assume of the dras
estimate

01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go up a bit but not that much
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
so with that said uh and yes
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned senator that uh we're
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
all amazed at the revenues that have
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
come in so far this year
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh and uh is it
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
is your position and giving being
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
majority leader that
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh even if even if this number was uh
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
called say 110
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
million or 120 million uh
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
that that's something that we can manage
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
get past this bill i i mean yes it is
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question i think
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know in looking at the first fiscal
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
note the upper range of 135 million we
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
felt it was manageable then
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
too so um what it ends up being i think
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
we're probably not going to know
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
for some time but it's
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
i believe not only important i think i
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
keep stressing this that
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
um we do everything possible to help
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
you know the businesses that need the
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
help in surviving the pandemic but
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
also the statement that it makes in
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
terms of new hampshire being
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
open for business and and welcoming
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
business i think
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
that's vital too if if we don't pass
 
01:24:13.679 --> 01:24:15.189 align:start position:0%
that's vital too if if we don't pass
this

01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
what opportunities are we going to lose
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
i i remain very concerned about that
 
01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.709 align:start position:0%
i i remain very concerned about that
also

01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you senator representative
 
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.950 align:start position:0%
thank you senator representative
spielsberg

01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman and
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you senator bradley
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's obvious that you and the senate
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
have put a lot of effort into this
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
and uh feel committed but there there is
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
something that's really perplexing me
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
the ppp was structured as a loan program
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
and it stipulated certain um
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
qualifying expenses
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
that would allow for excusing the debt
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
so for it to be converted from a loan
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
um you know to essentially a grant
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
with the debt excused you had to
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
use it for qualified expenses at least
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
60 percent of which were
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
payroll and as as you say
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
the real intended beneficiary
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
was the employees the country of denmark
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
did essentially the same thing but
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
bypassed local government and
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
employers and just sent the money to the
 
01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.110 align:start position:0%
employers and just sent the money to the
employees

01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
same outcome so here's what's confusing
 
01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.470 align:start position:0%
same outcome so here's what's confusing
me

01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
if all of the money received from ppp
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
had to be offset by qualified deductions
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
why is there actually any
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
business tax liability for those
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
businesses to be concerned about
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
or to put it a different way
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
isn't it really the case that these
 
01:26:01.679 --> 01:26:03.110 align:start position:0%
isn't it really the case that these
businesses

01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
would get a benefit from sb3 and
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
conversely the state
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
would take a hit in their tax revenues
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
only to the extent
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
that the exact same deductible expenses
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
that were paid with ppp funds now
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
are allowed to be used to offset
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
revenues already or otherwise generate
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
um am i missing something so
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not a tax expert i'm not an
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
accountant i'm not a lawyer
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
um so just understand that when i try to
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
answer the question
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding of when the cares act
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
passed and how it was structured
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
is that payroll had to account i believe
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
it was for 70 or 75 percent of the
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
eligible expenses and it was limited to
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
beyond that certain things like the
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
payment of mortgage
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
utility and rent so it was a fairly
 
01:27:00.719 --> 01:27:01.990 align:start position:0%
utility and rent so it was a fairly
limited

01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
limited
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
amount of items that could be expensed
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
by a business
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
under a ppp loan it did its job
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
our state you know shot
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
our unemployment rate shot up over 15
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's back to three percent now
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
and um businesses are having a hard time
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
finding work
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
at this point in time so
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
i think it it did its job and now it's
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
at least in my view not the time to say
 
01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.790 align:start position:0%
at least in my view not the time to say
okay

01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
you got through this this grant helped
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
you and remember you have to
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
in order to um get it
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
turned into a grant it has to be
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
signed off on by the banker that
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
originated the ppp loan so you have to
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
have abided by you know the stipulations
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
that i outlined previously
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
um that turns it into a grant
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
i it was never intended to be a taxable
 
01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.350 align:start position:0%
i it was never intended to be a taxable
event

01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
event
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
in washington for good reason it was
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
intended to keep the economy afloat i
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
i don't i think new hampshire should
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
treat it the same way it's
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
it should be a treated as a grant not a
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman have a brief follow-up
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand
 
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
your intention to provide the maximum
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
amount of assistance
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
to businesses were placed in a difficult
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
situation because of government
 
01:28:36.719 --> 01:28:38.310 align:start position:0%
situation because of government
decisions

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh but i just wonder if it
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
if we can agree that effectively what we
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
would be doing if we
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
passed sb3 is we would be
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
adding an additional
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
form of assistance by relieving our
 
01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.669 align:start position:0%
form of assistance by relieving our
businesses

01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh to the tune of about another 91
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars in taxes they would have
 
01:29:02.239 --> 01:29:03.030 align:start position:0%
million dollars in taxes they would have
owed

01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
owed
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't see it that way
 
01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't see it that way
representative

01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
because i think in most instances for
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
those smaller businesses
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
500 and fewer employees they got payroll
 
01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.470 align:start position:0%
500 and fewer employees they got payroll
protection

01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
it replaced revenue that they would have
 
01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.070 align:start position:0%
it replaced revenue that they would have
lost

01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
lost
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
as a result of the pandemic so i i don't
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
the way i look at it we're not giving
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
an additional benefit there's not a
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
double counting here
 
01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
it kept businesses afloat that was its
 
01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:39.030 align:start position:0%
it kept businesses afloat that was its
intent

01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
and it performed now is not the time to
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
backtrack and um say oh by the way
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
unlike the federal government which has
 
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
said it's a grant if you abide by the
 
01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.310 align:start position:0%
said it's a grant if you abide by the
conditions

01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to make it a payroll
 
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
we're going to make it a payroll
taxation

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
event i i just don't see it that way
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you senator representative
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
senator bradley i i've got on two
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
questions here one of them
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
is the timing on this on
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
we got this guidance from the u.s
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
treasury already but it's sufficiently
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
vague that
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
some people including dra are not sure
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
that it means that we can use money from
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
arpa to pay for this
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
um well while they're following that
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
up on
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
our if it turns out that
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're on our own for paying for this is
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
this going to be
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
something accounted for in the senate
 
01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:52.790 align:start position:0%
something accounted for in the senate
budget

01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
which it was not accounted for in the
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
house because we did not have this bill
 
01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
house because we did not have this bill
yet

01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a fairly substantial amount of
 
01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:01.270 align:start position:0%
so it's a fairly substantial amount of
money

01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
any way they measure it yeah my and
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
i am not a member of the senate finance
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee my understanding is that
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
um it will be accounted for
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you and could i add something else
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about on
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
putting a preamble onto this that
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
would on assuming that the arbor money
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
is available
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
on point point out that
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
on this uh would be able to be
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
paid for from the the federal funds but
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh would would be considered within
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh all the other things that the federal
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
funds might be spent for by the state
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh the wording obviously is not very
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
clear yet
 
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
um well thank you very much uh
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative all me i would ask
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
that um if you're going to
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
put a preamble on that you know we work
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
together and make sure that
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
any changes to the language don't
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
undermine the intent
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
of the language um as i said before
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh and i think that you know if you
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
um trying to find where the map that
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
somebody provided
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
to me came from but just looking at the
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
map of the 39 states
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
that right now do not tax the ppp
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
loans i see almost
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
no way having been in washington before
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
that suddenly the
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
new administration or congress is going
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
to reverse
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
course on the ppp loans with if new
 
01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:52.870 align:start position:0%
course on the ppp loans with if new
hampshire

01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
joins in not taxing it'll be 40 states
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
and there may well be
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
some of the remaining 10 that are in the
 
01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.430 align:start position:0%
some of the remaining 10 that are in the
same

01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
process that we're at now in
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
consideration senate bill 3.
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
so i just don't see it as a
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
threat that we need to worry about
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
given the vast majority of states
 
01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:15.830 align:start position:0%
given the vast majority of states
already

01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
are not taxing it because of the way
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
their tax structure works with
 
01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:23.590 align:start position:0%
their tax structure works with
conformity

01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
conformity
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you on yes i i understand we ought
 
01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:32.870 align:start position:0%
thank you on yes i i understand we ought
to

01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
the committee ought to work together
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
with you uh about any wording
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
if we do this but the um
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
the idea was if it is uh
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
refundable essentially by by arpa on
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
that would take about a ninth out of
 
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
the arpa monies that we get and
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh i would hope that a lot of that is
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
going to be going to broadband
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
and roads and bridges and other things
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
that are really
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
important to the uh future of our
 
01:34:06.639 --> 01:34:07.669 align:start position:0%
important to the uh future of our
economy

01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
in this state so it it is
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
a decision that we all are going to have
 
01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.470 align:start position:0%
a decision that we all are going to have
to

01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
look at eventually in terms of
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
how the arpa money gets spent assuming
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature has a say in that this
 
01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:23.590 align:start position:0%
the legislature has a say in that this
time

01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
and um that's was
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
the reason we were thinking of a
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
preamble so everybody would have that in
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
mind thank you
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
and i i appreciate that again and i
 
01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
guess that
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
um i would ask you to support my bill
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 85
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
which creates a matching grant
 
01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.830 align:start position:0%
which creates a matching grant
initiative

01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
um for broadband expansion and obviously
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
the ability to use some of that money
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
but again let me let me stress it was
 
01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:52.950 align:start position:0%
but again let me let me stress it was
never

01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
intended in new hampshire and it was
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
certainly never
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
intended federally to be a taxable event
 
01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:00.470 align:start position:0%
intended federally to be a taxable event
this

01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
this money um propped up the economy
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
and kept businesses and hardworking men
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
and women
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
afloat it it should not be treated as a
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
taxable event
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
and and again you've got the
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
impact that it would have on the current
 
01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:20.070 align:start position:0%
impact that it would have on the current
businesses

01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but i think just as big
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
as that
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
is the message that it sends that oh
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
we're now in the taxation um raising
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
business and
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i think as we're trying to
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
distinguish ourselves as a state that's
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
open for business and we want to recover
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
from the pandemic
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
further questions if not i do have a
 
01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.109 align:start position:0%
further questions if not i do have a
question

01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:51.119 --> 01:35:54.310 align:start position:0%
question
representative

01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
the patient check protection program
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
has helped out a lot of a lot of our
 
01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.669 align:start position:0%
has helped out a lot of a lot of our
businesses

01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
and essentially what says that if they
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
used it for what was intended for
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
then the loan is
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
turned into a grant and in addition to
 
01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.350 align:start position:0%
turned into a grant and in addition to
that

01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
they can have a they can deduct all the
 
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.590 align:start position:0%
they can have a they can deduct all the
expenses

01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
so they get a double benefit of this
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
now especially on the first part
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
of the first stimulus there were a
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
number of companies
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
that applied for this but they weren't
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
qualified they were in desperate need of
 
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:44.950 align:start position:0%
qualified they were in desperate need of
help

01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
but they weren't qualified primarily on
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
the first one because
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
they started their businesses in 2019
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
and in 2020 they made more so that
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
automatically disqualified them what
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
would you do
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
to help those businesses some of them
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
had to go out of business
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
and someone had to mortgage their homes
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
and everything else what would you do
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
to help those businesses that didn't
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
qualify for the ppp
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
that really needed it uh well thank you
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman again for your question
 
01:37:21.679 --> 01:37:22.629 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman again for your question
again

01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the ppp for those
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
businesses that got it and remember was
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
the smaller
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
up to 500 employees the main street
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
businesses the
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
backbone of you know our state it was to
 
01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
backbone of you know our state it was to
replace

01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
replace
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
revenue loss from the pandemic so
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know businesses that
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for having forgotten the
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
number of the senate pass bill but
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
it probably is in your committee mr
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
chairman where we
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
on a going forward basis um
 
01:38:03.170 --> 01:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
make any further um
 
01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:05.750 align:start position:0%
make any further um
[Music]

01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
similar programs from the feds eligible
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
for those newer businesses i think
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
had we been writing uh this
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
payroll protection plan in the new
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislature
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the u.s congress we
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
probably would have um thought of that
 
01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:22.709 align:start position:0%
probably would have um thought of that
but

01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know we can't control what happened
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i will say
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
that when congress passed this and again
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
having been there um
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
it passed in warp speed in the end of
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
the end of
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
march and it is so rare that you have
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan consensus that
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
you know you had the pass the cares act
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
um a year ago it was actually rather
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
remarkable and it was very necessary and
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
it wasn't perfect um so
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
i i think the senate has sent to you
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
a bill that will impact um
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
positively i think newer businesses and
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
let's also remember that governor sununu
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
established the main street program
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
um and i i've forgotten exactly
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
how much federal money of the cares act
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
discretionary money that came to new
 
01:39:18.159 --> 01:39:19.430 align:start position:0%
discretionary money that came to new
hampshire

01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
um went into the main street program but
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
it was a lot of
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
dollars and i know that in my area there
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
were businesses that didn't get ppp
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
that did get main street and so
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think that we've all tried to be
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
responsive to
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
and will continue to be responsive to
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
you know those businesses that
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
senator could you send me
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%

01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%

01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%

01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%

you for the opportunity again my name is
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
dave giuve i'm a senior vice president
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
with the business and
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
industry association we are very
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill
 
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
i thought senator bradley did a terrific
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
job outlining
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
the bill why it's necessary and what's
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
going around
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
on around the country relating to this
 
01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.430 align:start position:0%
on around the country relating to this
issue

01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
so i don't have a lot to add to that
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
although i'd be happy to respond to
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee i would
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
like to say that it is
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
bias analysis and also the analysis of
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
steve lawler
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
that that exemption for states
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
that are coming into conformity with the
 
01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:18.229 align:start position:0%
that are coming into conformity with the
latest

01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
latest
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
irs guidelines can use
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
that new money from the american
 
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
recovery act
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
to supplement any revenue loss
 
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's equally clear to us that other
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
things that are written in the house
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
past version of the budget like the
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
reductions in the um
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
business taxes and uh other
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
reductions in the rooms and meals tax
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
would likely not qualify but because
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
brings new hampshire into conformity
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
with the most recent irs guidelines it's
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
our analysis
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh that it would qualify but obviously
 
01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:53.750 align:start position:0%
uh that it would qualify but obviously
um

01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're all waiting for clarification from
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
the treasury department
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
um mr chair i'll end my testimony there
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
but i would like to turn it over to
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
steve lawler now for some additional
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
comments and then we're
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions okay mr
 
01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.149 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions okay mr
lawler

01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
lawler
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
you have to thank you very much mr
 
01:43:10.719 --> 01:43:11.350 align:start position:0%
you have to thank you very much mr
chairman

01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to just clarify a few things
 
01:43:14.159 --> 01:43:15.109 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to just clarify a few things
um

01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
there were a number of businesses that
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
did get the the payroll protection
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh loan money um they did
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
use it for payroll they kept people on
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
um they kept their businesses open where
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
they may have closed
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
they used that money to pay the people
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
that didn't have to go on employment
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
they limped along and they got to
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
um the end of the year they may have
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
broke even
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
between they were able to for revenue
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
and what they had for expenses which
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
would included that payroll
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
but there isn't a lot of money left over
 
01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
to pay the business profit tax
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
if they had to do that and i think
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's where the federal government
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
when they initially institute the cares
 
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:00.550 align:start position:0%
when they initially institute the cares
act

01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
and also that they realized that
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
businesses this money was a lifeline for
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
businesses and
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
to have them pay tax on that at the end
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
would have been a burden because then
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't have it then they may have a
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
close shop and they made to have people
 
01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:17.189 align:start position:0%
close shop and they made to have people
to

01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
um go on unemployment so
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
um not all businesses but there was a
 
01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
number of businesses
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
that and at the time are very worried
 
01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.669 align:start position:0%
that and at the time are very worried
because

01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
construction workers what needs to be
 
01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
done to protect the house
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
tomorrow could you okay okay sorry
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make people aware of
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
not necessarily was a windfall but there
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
was you know people kept their
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
businesses alive
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
they got their people employed and not
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
actually have to pay a tax on that
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know could be a significant burden
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you for your
 
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
testimony questions from the committee
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative ames followed by
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh mr lawler
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
my question is uh is what
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
you mentioned you mentioned uh
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
businesses coming to the end of the year
 
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:18.709 align:start position:0%
businesses coming to the end of the year
and

01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
they've scraped by and ppp has been very
 
01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:22.870 align:start position:0%
they've scraped by and ppp has been very
helpful

01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering about uh
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
whether they've been paying the state
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
tax dra has been quite clear
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
that our situation until
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
sb3 or something changes it applies
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
to a forgiven loan and
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
so have in your experience to your
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge have
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
firms been paying
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
either by estimate or by return uh
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
tax on these uh forgiven loan proceeds
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
or is it too early to know or can you
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
um a couple things uh one is
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
you only get taxed upon the forgiveness
 
01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:13.270 align:start position:0%
you only get taxed upon the forgiveness
and

01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
um there was a number of companies that
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten their forgiveness yet so
 
01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a 2021
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
issue um i think
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
not what i've seen is that it was not
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
worked into estimated tax formulas
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
um with the hope that it would be not
 
01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:32.149 align:start position:0%
um with the hope that it would be not
taxable

01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you just follow up
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
just just to be clear so so in your
 
01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:42.709 align:start position:0%
just just to be clear so so in your
experience

01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh based on what you've seen what you
 
01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:46.629 align:start position:0%
uh based on what you've seen what you
know

01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
the esc the increase in revenues that we
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
are harvesting in new hampshire
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's one word that seems almost
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
applicable since the revenues are so
 
01:47:01.119 --> 01:47:03.030 align:start position:0%
applicable since the revenues are so
high

01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
it isn't hasn't been affected by
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh payments of this uh
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
state level tax that uh firms expect
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
will be refunded later on
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever you know this this is
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
not related can you speak to them
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
um it the only reason i could speak to
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
it is i think it gave a lifeline to a
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
which ended up doing better but they
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
would have never been able to stay open
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
if they weren't able to get this
 
01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.709 align:start position:0%
if they weren't able to get this
lifeline

01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
lifeline
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:44.229 align:start position:0%
 
representing

01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
representatives i thought you were
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead yes thanks thank you mr
 
01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:51.189 align:start position:0%
go ahead yes thanks thank you mr
chairman

01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh is mr uh duvet still on the line i am
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my question has to deal
 
01:47:58.880 --> 01:47:59.430 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my question has to deal
with

01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
the state has priorities as uh as does
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
other organizations
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire if expenses paid for
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
with pp loans
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
or amounts remain deductible which means
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
a reduction
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
which would mean a reduction in taxable
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
from normal times what happens to the
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
priorities of uh
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
supporting adequate funding to health
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
care providers for medicaid and other
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
publicly supported health care
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
programs and what happens to the
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
priority of supporting net metering
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
policies that do not result in cost
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
shifting and the last part is what
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
happens these priorities
 
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
for adequate investment in new
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire's road and bridges if
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're allowing the
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
well i'll start on that but i might want
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
to turn it over to steve lawler
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
so okay i don't know that the net
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
metering issue
 
01:49:06.629 --> 01:49:06.639 align:start position:0%
um which is primarily on on the tariff
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's paid to
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
customers who are engaged in net
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
metering has anything to do
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
with this or state revenues and
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
to a great extent
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
the highway program it relies on the
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
highway user taxes paid into the state's
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
highway fund which again
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
is not impacted by this legislation
 
01:49:34.709 --> 01:49:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know one way the state can
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
pay for uh priorities is is through
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
the uh vast
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
increase in in business tax collections
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
far beyond what was
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
expected and and i think we can all
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
agree that the economy
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
even though we're still you know
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
hampered by the pandemic the economy
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
seems to be getting
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
stronger at least that's what we're
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
hearing from our members who have many
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
open positions that they can't even find
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
people to fill
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
so there's every indication that the
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
economy is going to continue to get
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
stronger not weaker
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
now in terms of i think the specific of
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
your question relating to the
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
deductibility of
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
of business expenses i i am hoping steve
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
lawler can address that better than i
 
01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.709 align:start position:0%
lawler can address that better than i
could

01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
um my understanding of the
 
01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:23.990 align:start position:0%
um my understanding of the
representative's

01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative's
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
question was that if the money wasn't
 
01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:27.270 align:start position:0%
question was that if the money wasn't
there

01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
how would you prioritize other um state
 
01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:31.109 align:start position:0%
how would you prioritize other um state
needs

01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
a in a way i just we're not
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
we're not counting this revenue we're
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
not double counting this revenue but we
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
seem to be taken
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
and a deductible of applying this
 
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
money spp loans as deductible
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
expenses that
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
weren't even counted in the beginning i
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
understand what the policy is i'm just
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out
 
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
how much money we're maybe going to lose
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
well if i could if if we're right in our
 
01:51:08.159 --> 01:51:09.669 align:start position:0%
well if i could if if we're right in our
analysis

01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
um representative and yes the state
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
is able to use that new
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
income coming to the state from the um
 
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
american recovery
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
act to supplement any loss
 
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
that results from bringing the state
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
into compliance with newer
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
are you all set representative
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
schoenberg yes i
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you on i had
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
three questions one of them
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
is how many new hampshire businesses
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
have more than 500 employees
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
i've always thought that that was very
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
few it's a large business
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's a very large
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire at 500.
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
it's a small business medium business
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
yeah representative all me i'm sorry i
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
don't have access to that information
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if someone from dra
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
could respond to that or if you could
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
check with business and economic affairs
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
i do agree with you
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the grand scheme of things throughout
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
the country 500 employees would not be
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
considered a
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
large business but here in new hampshire
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
the scale is different
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
we do we already want to be testifying
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
later yeah and we could check i don't
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
know if employment security
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
could tell us also um
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
but the second one is probably something
 
01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:51.430 align:start position:0%
but the second one is probably something
that

01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
that you haven't worked on either which
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
is how many of these businesses are part
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
of water's edge filings
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
that is they are subsidiaries or
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
or subcontract i haven't figured out yet
 
01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:09.070 align:start position:0%
or subcontract i haven't figured out yet
whether

01:53:09.070 --> 01:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
subcontractors sometimes are considered
 
01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:12.550 align:start position:0%
subcontractors sometimes are considered
subsidiaries

01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
in water's edge in dra and that may be a
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
question for
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
for the dra again we we don't have
 
01:53:20.239 --> 01:53:20.790 align:start position:0%
for the dra again we we don't have
access

01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
the bia doesn't have access to
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
information about who
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
filed for a for a ppp loan and
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
of those which had the loans forgiven so
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
again i wouldn't be able to answer that
 
01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:32.950 align:start position:0%
again i wouldn't be able to answer that
question

01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
and well i don't know if you can answer
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
this one but you may have
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
better ideas than anybody else we could
 
01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:40.470 align:start position:0%
better ideas than anybody else we could
ask

01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh we we got access to a spreadsheet
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
which is maintained supposedly
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh for the federal government about how
 
01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:49.830 align:start position:0%
uh for the federal government about how
many

01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh which ppp loans are in each town
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the state on and
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
almost all of the ones that i checked in
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
my town of
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
so on is it true generally across the
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
state i see
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
mr lalor nodding his head
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
that on the forgive forgiving process
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
is just starting because i'd understood
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
it was going pretty
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
fast yeah representative um
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
when they passed uh the next uh
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think it was the the act that right at
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
the end of december
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of the banks were scrambling to
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
get new ppp loans
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
out and a lot of the banks put on the
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
forgiveness process on hold
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
i was looking at a bank this morning
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
that is only going to be
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
accepting applications for forgiveness
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
up to 150 000
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
over 2 million so all those
 
01:54:56.070 --> 01:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
loans that were for that were given in
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
between that cannot apply yet
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
um so i think that's where the
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
ready to apply there's just been some
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
slowness in
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury thank you mr
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
chairman uh this is for either uh miss
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
kishivey or mr lawler
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
um and it it gets uh pretty much to the
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
question that i was asking senator
 
01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:27.510 align:start position:0%
question that i was asking senator
bradley

01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
bradley
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh but essentially
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
hb3 seems to be motivated by a concern
 
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
that we should not have businesses who
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
are receiving a lifeline
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
exposed to incremental tax liability
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
for the funds that the government
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
provided them
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
but if they managed to
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
or do manage to have that loan excused
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
it's only because they did with the
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
funds exactly what was
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
intended and that is used them primarily
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
for payroll expense
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
and for other qualified expenses all of
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
which are deductible expenses
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
so if every dollar of ppp
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
which has been excused was excused
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
exclusively because it was offset by
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
a dollar of qualified expenses how can
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
there be
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
any incremental exposure to business
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
is the presumed harm
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'll let steve lawler address that
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
question we did
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
stephen i did chat about that issue
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday so
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh steve as well
 
01:56:48.790 --> 01:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
i mean it comes to the point is
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
as i talked in the beginning my
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
testimony there are businesses out there
 
01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:52.870 align:start position:0%
testimony there are businesses out there
that

01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
yes they did use it for payroll
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
and they used it as a lifeline to keep
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
their doors
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
open now the cash isn't there for them
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
to pay the business profit tax
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
on that additional revenue that the
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
ppp forgiveness would um
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
would cause um because they used all
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
that money they would have closed their
 
01:57:16.159 --> 01:57:17.830 align:start position:0%
that money they would have closed their
doors

01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
doors
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
and they would have not had the people
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
on payroll
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
a restaurant that was closed
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
but they got the ppp money and kept
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
paying their people
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
and then they may reopened again um they
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
made a little profit before the end of
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
the year
 
01:57:37.109 --> 01:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
so now maybe they broke even because of
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
their expenses versus a little bit of
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
profit that they could make because they
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
were only open for a short period of
 
01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:42.390 align:start position:0%
were only open for a short period of
time

01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
and now and they got the ppp money to
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
help them get through that
 
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
and they pretty much broke even but now
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's no money left in order to pay
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
the taxes
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
so brief follow-through please all
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
just tracking what you said this is the
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
way i interpret it
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
they consumed all of the ppp funds
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
for qualified expenses thus exhausting
 
01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
the cash flow that was incrementally
 
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
tax liabilities but there are no tax
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
liabilities associated
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
with that amount of ppp funds because
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
they were entirely offset by deductions
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
so the only tax liability would be from
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
business as usual
 
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
i right but there may not have been
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
business as usual if they weren't able
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
to keep their doors open
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
there either were profits that are
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
taxable where there were no time
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
they yeah because they were able to keep
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
their doors open and they were to work
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
they made a little bit of money but they
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
broke even from a revenue standpoint
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
an expense standpoint and now if you add
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
that additional
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
income from the ppp loan forgiveness
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
there isn't the funds there to pay for
 
01:59:07.119 --> 01:59:09.350 align:start position:0%
there isn't the funds there to pay for
it

01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh next would be representative bronson
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
here uh this question will be for mr
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
lawler i'm just following up on uh
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative ames's um question
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
i i i guess what we're interested in
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
a little bit more on is we're ahead as
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
of yesterday
 
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
71 million in business taxes revenues
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
which i've been on ways of means for 11
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
years we've never seen a month like this
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh so we're suspecting that it may have
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
something to do with
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
all of what we're discussing here but
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
you but
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
mr you said that not really
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
um maybe some of it but uh
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
because of this the new interesting
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
comment you made was upon forgiveness
 
01:59:57.679 --> 01:59:58.390 align:start position:0%
comment you made was upon forgiveness
that that

01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
this event doesn't happen until the loan
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
is actually forgiven which is
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
very helpful to to uh that was that i
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of that
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
so so when we look at
 
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
taxable year 20 and taxable year 21
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that there really
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
weren't that many loans
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
forgiven in in in 20 is
 
02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
can you get a little more light to any
 
02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge about
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the loans were were
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
forgiven in 20 verses that are still
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
being forgiven
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
21 uh that will be forgiven in 21.
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
see that'll help us try to understand
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
this whole
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
is this some of this due to uh people
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
paying their taxes
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh without this bill being passed to
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
comply with current statute
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
and that expecting a refund later on if
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
the bill passes i can't give you a
 
02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
percentage of how many were forgiven
 
02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:56.629 align:start position:0%
percentage of how many were forgiven
before

02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
the end of 2020 and the end of 21. i can
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
only give you what my experiences
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
and what i've seen through my client
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
base um we do
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
we did have a number of people that had
 
02:01:08.070 --> 02:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
their loans forgiven before the end of
 
02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:10.310 align:start position:0%
their loans forgiven before the end of
2020

02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
what has happened with those businesses
 
02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:13.830 align:start position:0%
what has happened with those businesses
is

02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
their they are realized that there is
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
a bill that is working its way through
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
um that was passed in the the senate and
 
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
is working its way through the house
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
um and what they have done is extended
 
02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:28.149 align:start position:0%
um and what they have done is extended
their

02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
returns in essence in order to see what
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
the outcome was
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
um and either paid
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
paid based on current law or is waiting
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
to see
 
02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
what the the outcome will be and and pay
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
their taxes
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
at that particular time okay
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
well thank you that's helpful thank you
 
02:01:53.350 --> 02:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
any further questions of represent
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
i i do have one comment that is over the
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
weekend i talked to a
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
an accountant and he asked
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
what are we doing with the senate bill 3
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i said we're working on it he says
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
good he says because he had a lot of
 
02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:17.990 align:start position:0%
good he says because he had a lot of
customers

02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
who have been paying the tax
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
because they're using current law and
 
02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:28.719 align:start position:0%
if this passes as is
 
02:02:31.109 --> 02:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
then they're going to be asking for
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
refunds right
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
away and so
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
what we need to understand is this
 
02:02:38.639 --> 02:02:39.830 align:start position:0%
what we need to understand is this
windfall

02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
windfall
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
of taxes that we're getting from the bbt
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
right now the business taxes how much of
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
that is associated
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
with paying the tax on the bppt
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
on on the ppp loans
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
and then if senate bill 3
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
passes as it is then that will turn the
 
02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
thing around
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
that as he said
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
there'd be a lot of requests for refunds
 
02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:15.189 align:start position:0%
there'd be a lot of requests for refunds
or

02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
reduce ccos
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
so i from what i've heard today
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
we don't know what that is but we need
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
to ask the dra that
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions for a
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%

02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
um i did want to just offer to help with
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
any questions and
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
i did want to try to specifically
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
address a couple of questions that came
 
02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:43.830 align:start position:0%
address a couple of questions that came
up

02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
um both representative almi and i
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
believe representative abrami asked
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
questions about forgiveness
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
um i did just want to add that the
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
forgiveness process has started
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
there was a delay i know that the sba
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
was trying to work through and so they
 
02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:02.790 align:start position:0%
was trying to work through and so they
had

02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
a deadline of 90 days the sba had a
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
deadline of 90 days to issue their
 
02:05:08.159 --> 02:05:09.109 align:start position:0%
deadline of 90 days to issue their
decision

02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
unforgiveness once a bank processed that
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
there were many loans that were sort of
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
held over past that 90 day mark and the
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
banks were looking for guidances in
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
when that forgiveness might happen and
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
how that might come
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge as of the state that has
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
not yet been resolved
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
and that was that was not uh that was
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
sort of the exception by and large with
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
forgiveness was happening
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
on a fairly rapid basis and that that's
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard anything contrary to
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
that with this most
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
second round with this uh most recent
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
round of ppp funding
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and then representative abrami i know
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
that you asked the question of the
 
02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:47.510 align:start position:0%
that you asked the question of the
percentage

02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
of forgiveness versus not forgiveness
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
in the various rounds i don't have those
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
percentages for you
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
but what i can tell you is that it was
 
02:05:59.189 --> 02:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
the majority or the overwhelming
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
majority of loans
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
that were forgiven um and certainly
 
02:06:03.119 --> 02:06:03.669 align:start position:0%
that were forgiven um and certainly
banks

02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
banks
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
were working with their their customers
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
get them so that way their loans could
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
be forgiven and would try to
 
02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
recommend in working with the business
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
owner how they use it so that way that
 
02:06:16.149 --> 02:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
it could try to be forgiven
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
um and you know the only other comment
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
that i would make
 
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the forgiveness and and what
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
the intent was behind congress
 
02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
it is our view that it was intended to
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
to really be
 
02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:30.159 align:start position:0%
a grant and i think the fact that
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
congress came back
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
and they expanded what what qualified
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
as an eligible expense the fact that
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
that was expanded
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
um is consistent with our sort of
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation that
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
congress really designed this to be a
 
02:06:43.679 --> 02:06:44.470 align:start position:0%
congress really designed this to be a
grant

02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
grant
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
in the case that others couldn't use it
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
for those eligible expenses than it is
 
02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:49.669 align:start position:0%
for those eligible expenses than it is
alone

02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
alone
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that that is
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
that is really
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
um as i said i don't have percentages
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
but that's really the minority
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the ppp applications that were
 
02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:01.430 align:start position:0%
of the ppp applications that were
approved

02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
approved
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you take
 
02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:07.589 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you take
questions

02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
mrs merrill will you take a take
 
02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:10.709 align:start position:0%
mrs merrill will you take a take
questions

02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
i will gladly i'm sorry okay
 
02:07:13.679 --> 02:07:14.390 align:start position:0%
i will gladly i'm sorry okay
representative

02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
romney followed by representative elmi
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you miss merrill for taking my
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
question um so
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i understand
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
now when did when did the forgiveness
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
begin um it began
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
fairly soon after the first round i mean
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
the the program
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
started over a year ago so um the
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
forgiveness process started
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
i forget now and there have been so many
 
02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
changes and guidances but
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
um relatively quickly there was a little
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
bit of delay in the process in terms of
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
how that was going to happen and
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
everything but um
 
02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:50.719 align:start position:0%
i mean i i want to say within the first
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
couple of months
 
02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
okay so follow up mr chair follow up
 
02:07:58.950 --> 02:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
so uh so you're uh make sure i
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
understood what you said it sounded like
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
you feel that a lot of the forgiveness
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
has happened i do i i do with respect to
 
02:08:08.709 --> 02:08:08.719 align:start position:0%
round one
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
as i said many banks were concerned
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
there were
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
there were loans um in there that they
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
held that were not yet forgiven that
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
were past that 90 days and the rules
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
said that the sba had 90 days and so
 
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
they they're anxious to get those
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
um forgiven but that was the the
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
exception rather than the rule
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh no second follow-up mr chair
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
follow up uh miss merrill so uh
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
so the round two the second draw uh was
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
another 290 billion is that correct
 
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
something like that i believe so i don't
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
have those total numbers right in front
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
of me but i believe so
 
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
290 billion so uh but but so
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh there's still may 31st is that is
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding from dra that
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's still 50 billion remaining in
 
02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:56.229 align:start position:0%
there's still 50 billion remaining in
that

02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
that and so so i guess additional loans
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
are still going to be
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
coming do you have any information on
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
that yes i do let me just grab my notes
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
if i can
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
okay as of earlier this week there is 30
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
billion left in the program
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
and so they expect that that will run
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
out to the price to the program's end
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
and you probably know this but as a
 
02:09:18.149 --> 02:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
reminder the program
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
ends on may 31 but there's an additional
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
beyond that to process applications that
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
are pending
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
and again uh one more follow-up mr chair
 
02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:29.189 align:start position:0%
and again uh one more follow-up mr chair
oh

02:09:29.189 --> 02:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
so all of yes all of that this uh
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
second draw which because it was it
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
passed in december
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
really is going to affect 21 taxes is
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i i did not catch the last
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
part of what you said
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
so since the since that law was passed
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
at the end of december
 
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
everything we're talking about in the
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
second draw really was effects
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh 21 fiscal taxable year 21 is that
 
02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.830 align:start position:0%
uh 21 fiscal taxable year 21 is that
correct

02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:09:59.830 --> 02:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
i believe so but i would just say that i
 
02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
do not profess to be a tax
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
expert and and could be wrong in my tax
 
02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
years okay
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll talk to dra about that thank
 
02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:08.229 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll talk to dra about that thank
you

02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:10:13.109 --> 02:10:13.119 align:start position:0%
okay before i go to represent army
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
you keep hearing about the first
 
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
and the second uh bpp
 
02:10:23.669 --> 02:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
loan program the first one
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
went from april 2020 to
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
august 31st of 2020.
 
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
the second one which we're in now
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
started 1-121
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
it goes to may 31st 21.
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
so there's probably almost another five
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
weeks left
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
for people to apply and then uh
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
looks like christy merrill just said
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
that there's about 30 billion dollars
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
left there
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
of the total okay uh
 
02:10:58.940 --> 02:10:58.950 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman on
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
ms merrill there on we found a website
 
02:11:08.719 --> 02:11:11.790 align:start position:0%
ms merrill there on we found a website
called

02:11:11.790 --> 02:11:11.800 align:start position:0%

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:21.430 align:start position:0%
federalpayon.com
which

02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh i can't bring these things up and
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
stay unmuted
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
at the same time federal federalpay.org
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
which on says that is linked from
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
the small business administration and
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
says that it is responsible for
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
reporting all of these loans
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
and that's the one i was talking about
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
earlier where um
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
i was looking through uh
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
the zip code which is most of lebanon
 
02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:56.470 align:start position:0%
the zip code which is most of lebanon
and

02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:58.950 --> 02:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
um recognized a fair number of the
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
people and
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
the businesses sometimes only by
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
by a certain amount of thought on
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
and on
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
almost all of them were reported as
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
neither repaid nor forgiven yet
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if there is another
 
02:12:24.390 --> 02:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
site somewhere or organization that we
 
02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
site somewhere or organization that we
could

02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
could ask that would tell us
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
how many how many loans have already
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
been forgiven in new hampshire or even
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
nationally because
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
it looks like that website must be
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
seriously out of date
 
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
it also had a lot of inaccuracies in it
 
02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.189 align:start position:0%
it also had a lot of inaccuracies in it
but

02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
thanks representative i'm not familiar
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
with the website um i will tell you that
 
02:12:50.239 --> 02:12:50.550 align:start position:0%
with the website um i will tell you that
we

02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
we do try to track the data here in new
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
york new hampshire pretty closely
 
02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
we represent 38 members 38 member banks
 
02:12:59.830 --> 02:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire chartered
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
out of state chartered as well as
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
nationally chartered banks
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
and of those 37 participated in the ppp
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
the one bank that did not participate
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
um does not offer commercial lending so
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's why they didn't participate
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
um so to answer your question
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
i've not i've never seen that number
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
reported i'm not saying that it's not
 
02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:19.830 align:start position:0%
reported i'm not saying that it's not
available

02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
but um we do try to track this closely
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
i've never seen the number reported as
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
to the number of loans forgiven
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
um the sba.gov website i i believe it's
 
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
sba dot or slash ppp.gov
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
i apologize something along those lines
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
they do publish all their data they i
 
02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
think they release that
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
every monday or every tuesday and that
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
gives you a running
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
tally of what's left it also gives a
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
breakdown by state but i've not seen the
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
number of forgiveness so
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
that really is the best i would just say
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
to give to go to the sba in new
 
02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:54.149 align:start position:0%
to give to go to the sba in new
hampshire

02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
to try to answer that question if they
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
can give it out they would have it um
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
and similar the the first program you're
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
right that um
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
they did release everyone every company
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
that got
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
got a loan um after the first round was
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
completed you can find that by state and
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
so we did sort of collect that data look
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
at that at new hampshire
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
i think they they gave a range between
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
two and 10 million
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
um they didn't give the exact loan
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
amount so i suspect
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
once this the second round closes we'll
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
see another
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh release of data i would expect that
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
to be consistent i don't know that
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
um but i would expect some additional
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
information but to my knowledge i have
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
not seen the forgiveness the one
 
02:14:37.030 --> 02:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
thing that i might be able to do is
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
survey our members
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
um but you know the the banks are all
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
very busy right now and so
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
i try to be selective and and what
 
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
are you also representing army
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
are you all set representing army on
 
02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes i think we need to contact sba new
 
02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:07.990 align:start position:0%
yes i think we need to contact sba new
hampshire

02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we do that but
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative spillsbury
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um miss maryland
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to just confirm that i've
 
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
got an understanding correctly it's a
 
02:15:24.069 --> 02:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
prelude to a question i want to post
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
so am i correcting understanding that
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
the ppp essentially deputized the banks
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
or members of your association
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
to manage the funds and
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
determine a qualification to receive ppp
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
and now their follow-up role is to
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
certify that the funds were
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
used appropriately before qualifying
 
02:15:48.079 --> 02:15:48.550 align:start position:0%
used appropriately before qualifying
them

02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
for the forgiveness is that correct
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
basically the banks
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
are reviewing the expenses and the use
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
of the funds in order to certify that
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
they qualify for forgiveness
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
um representative in terms of the final
 
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
forgiveness my understanding is that
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
that final decision
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
is made by the sba in terms of what is a
 
02:16:08.239 --> 02:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
is made by the sba in terms of what is a
qualified

02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
expense when a bank is working with a
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
customer they might walk them through to
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
help them understand what the eligible
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
expenses are and sort of make
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
suggestions to them basically
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of how to get those loans
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
forgiven but um
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately that final decision is made
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
by the sba in terms of forgiveness
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so here's my question
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
if an amendment were prepared to sb3
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
that essentially stated any
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
qualifying expenses that were
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
deployed against ppp in order to obtain
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
debt forgiveness cannot then be
 
02:16:53.699 --> 02:16:53.709 align:start position:0%
used as deductions from income
 
02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:54.870 align:start position:0%
used as deductions from income
[Music]

02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:58.830 --> 02:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
that would otherwise go into the bpt
 
02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:00.469 align:start position:0%
that would otherwise go into the bpt
calculation

02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
what would your reaction to that
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
amendment be or do you think that
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment would essentially counter the
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
well if i'm understanding your question
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
um so it as i it sounds like the root of
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
your question is that you're concerned
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
that a small business owner may be
 
02:17:25.589 --> 02:17:25.599 align:start position:0%
granted forgiveness based on eligible
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
expenses but also getting an additional
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
tax benefit is that
 
02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
a correct substantially using it in two
 
02:17:32.479 --> 02:17:33.910 align:start position:0%
a correct substantially using it in two
ways

02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
ways
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
to get a double deduction
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
what an amendment that precluded them
 
02:17:39.519 --> 02:17:40.389 align:start position:0%
what an amendment that precluded them
from

02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
using the same expense twice
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
um how would you view that
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
um well you know as i as i said in in
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
the beginning we don't officially have a
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
position obviously we have an interest
 
02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
in knowing the outcome
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
um as our members are processing a lot
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
of these applications
 
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
but i i guess what i would say and i
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
of help to you or not but i think what
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're the banks are finding
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
is that when um a small business owner
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
puts in an application
 
02:18:12.629 --> 02:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
and obviously you know everyone would
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
love to see a hundred percent of
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
forgiveness um there's some type of
 
02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:16.629 align:start position:0%
forgiveness um there's some type of
combination

02:18:16.629 --> 02:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
combination
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's not either entirely forgiven or
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
or not it's it's really a combination so
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
they might be able to
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
use you know 40 40 to 60 percent
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
on qualifying expenses but there's a
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
there's a remaining balance there
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
so um i you know i i wouldn't take a
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
position on that that's all i guess i
 
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
can say
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
and um i apologize if that's not really
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
helpful for you
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
all right actually that's very helpful
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
so in other words an amendment of that
 
02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:45.830 align:start position:0%
so in other words an amendment of that
sort

02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
sort
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
might have to be worded to the extent
 
02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:49.349 align:start position:0%
might have to be worded to the extent
that

02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh expenses resulted in
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
forgiveness dot dot dot i thank you i
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%

president ceo of the new hampshire

lodging and restaurant association
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
as i'm sure you're aware our industry
 
02:20:26.790 --> 02:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
has been very hard hit by this uh
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic as we try to come out of it
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh i testified before this committee i
 
02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
believe was a couple of months ago now
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
kind of tried to give an overview of
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
where we had come from and what we had
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
hoped for the future
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
um but i i guess i'm here to ask today
 
02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
first of all that you support support
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
sb3 i think
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh tax exemption of ppp is is the least
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
we should be doing for these small
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
businesses who are struggling
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i will tell you i continue to get
 
02:20:53.429 --> 02:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
phone calls from restauranteurs
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
specifically but many hotels as well
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
that are legitimately hanging on by the
 
02:20:59.910 --> 02:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
fingernails and frankly their
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
their lot probably isn't going to
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
improve any time before july 4th weekend
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
um so i you know i just i ask you to be
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
sensitive and i appreciate the fact that
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know you have a very difficult job
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how we're going to
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
fund the state for the next biennium
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
i get that um but i but i think what
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to ask of you is to also
 
02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:20.150 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to ask of you is to also
consider

02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh potentially uh exempting
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
the uh the cares act funds the the
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
main street relief funds and others to
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
also be included
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it can be done
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
specifically for our industry i suspect
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
not but
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're certainly requesting that because
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
there are many businesses right now
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
that are in in dire straits and as uh
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned a number of times in
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
this discussion today
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
we have um the purposes of these funds
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
was to keep our employees
 
02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
at work and and off the unemployment
 
02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
rolls and and
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
keep kept in place and and so that to
 
02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:55.990 align:start position:0%
keep kept in place and and so that to
the

02:21:55.990 --> 02:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
a couple of points that i believe
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
senator bradley made it was successful
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
in that effect and
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
it seems uh i will just say that from
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
many industry folks that i've spoken to
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
it is very frustrating that
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
they have fought and and scrabbled to
 
02:22:10.710 --> 02:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
get to this point
 
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
to then have the state potentially step
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
in and ask them for a portion of
 
02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
whatever aid they received in order to
 
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
prop up their businesses
 
02:22:20.309 --> 02:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
um and and for those of you who have
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
restaurant uh business owners as friends
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
i think you can appreciate that
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh they're a pretty independent lot they
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
don't like to ask for aid or assistance
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
but this was the year they needed it so
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
um that is my appeal to you
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
and uh with that i will close and i'd be
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have thank you for
 
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh mr sanders i do have a question
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
is how many in your organization
 
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
have contacted you because they weren't
 
02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:51.990 align:start position:0%
have contacted you because they weren't
allowed

02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
so there were some uh for the most part
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
they were larger businesses
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
and again you know you would anticipate
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
larger businesses
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
had a little more equity a little more
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
where with all but there were some
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
groups that certainly did not qualify
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
surprisingly it was more on the lodging
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
side the hotel side where folks did not
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
qualify for a variety of reasons and so
 
02:23:20.870 --> 02:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
there definitely were i'd be
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
hard-pressed to give you a
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
a percentage or a number uh
 
02:23:25.349 --> 02:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative but but there were a fair
 
02:23:26.790 --> 02:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that did not
 
02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:27.750 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that did not
qualify

02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
what i will also add as as a qualifier
 
02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:31.030 align:start position:0%
what i will also add as as a qualifier
is

02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
you know when it came to the main street
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
relief there were even more folks that
 
02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify for a variety of reasons
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
and how those uh programs were
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
structured as well and so
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
as we look at this there are a fair
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh again when i say they're hanging on
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
by their fingernails i don't think that
 
02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm really
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
understating their position well thank
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
you uh representative brundy
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you mr
 
02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
summers um can we just focus on the main
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
street program a second
 
02:24:00.389 --> 02:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
um how is that structured uh
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh is it is it were they grants to the
 
02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:03.590 align:start position:0%
uh is it is it were they grants to the
businesses

02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
was it similar to ppp or can you help us
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
out with that
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
i i know i don't i can't remember how
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
that was structured yeah and i
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
forgive forgive me my understanding is
 
02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
probably cursory because i wasn't
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
actually didn't go through the process
 
02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:16.710 align:start position:0%
actually didn't go through the process
but

02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
ultimately the way this worked it was it
 
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
was a pass-through from
 
02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh the federal cares act monies came
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
into the state and then the governor
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
and the gopher committee decided how to
 
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
distribute those funds
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
but ultimately that money came through
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
and was distributed to businesses
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh based on it on a need basis um and it
 
02:24:36.070 --> 02:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
was given uh
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
as as as uh forgivable grants
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
but couple of caveats so the first is uh
 
02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
the grants maxed out at 350
 
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
000 and frankly there were a lot of
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
people that got much much less than that
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
um but then there is also we have just
 
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
gone through a true up process where
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
um there was a calculation that was
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
required to be done and reporting
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh to dra where they had to take their
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
2019 sales deducted 2020 sales deduct um
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh ppp and whatever that difference was
 
02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:05.510 align:start position:0%
uh ppp and whatever that difference was
uh

02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know deduct main street from that
 
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
and then if
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
you were in the in the black then that
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
money will likely have to be returned to
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
the to the state
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
um but there are an awful lot of
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
businesses that were still in the red at
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
the end of those calculations
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
and so um i think to the crux of your
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
question representative i think
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh there was simply a pass-through grant
 
02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:25.349 align:start position:0%
uh there was simply a pass-through grant
from

02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
karzak money through the state to the
 
02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:29.270 align:start position:0%
karzak money through the state to the
businesses

02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
mr follow up mr chair but
 
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
again you wanted to roll this into this
 
02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:35.670 align:start position:0%
again you wanted to roll this into this
bill

02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:25:38.309 --> 02:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
so so is that that grant taxable at the
 
02:25:38.319 --> 02:25:39.510 align:start position:0%
so so is that that grant taxable at the
moment

02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes okay that's what i was trying to
 
02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
consider an income of the business and
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
again i
 
02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
i did follow up with dra to confirm that
 
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
but yes the grant monies uh will will be
 
02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
treated as income of the business and
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know i'll go a step further we now
 
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
have a third round of aid that are going
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
to businesses which is the restaurant
 
02:25:57.830 --> 02:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
revitalization fund which you may have
 
02:25:59.429 --> 02:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
heard of as part of their most recent
 
02:25:59.439 --> 02:26:00.230 align:start position:0%
heard of as part of their most recent
package

02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
package
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
and those grants was just announced
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
today that that grant portal will open
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
on may 3rd so there is going to be
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
another round of grant funding
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
that will go specifically primarily to
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
restaurants and so
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
again that's going to be another tax
 
02:26:13.349 --> 02:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
liability potentially for these
 
02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
businesses as
 
02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
as we get into next year but
 
02:26:20.070 --> 02:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
follow up again is it the grandest taxes
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
or is it really
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
after the grant is it the uh
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
if they still not profitable will there
 
02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:27.670 align:start position:0%
if they still not profitable will there
be

02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
assumption yes yeah we'll follow up with
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
the dra we'll
 
02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
follow the dra i'm sorry yes thank you
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you for your testimony thank
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
you sir appreciate your time uh
 
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
we have one more journey
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
yes uh michael benton
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh unfortunately i was unable
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
to register in time for today's meeting
 
02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for the moment
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
i am a business owner uh and
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
significantly benefited from ppp
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh i employ about 250 people in the
 
02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:16.630 align:start position:0%
uh i employ about 250 people in the
state

02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
and have gone through the process i'd
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
like to just make one thing
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
obvious that ppp did
 
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
more than provide the lost revenue
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
it provided my business with the ability
 
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
to stay afloat because the it wasn't
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
just the lost revenue
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
it was the lost profits i was shut down
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
for four months
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
without those funds i would have gone
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
out of business
 
02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
all the employees i was able to maintain
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
not just my employees but i was also
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
able to maintain the future of my
 
02:27:54.319 --> 02:27:55.510 align:start position:0%
able to maintain the future of my
business

02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
and if you say that we mix accounting
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh with the fact that i'm taking an
 
02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:02.790 align:start position:0%
uh with the fact that i'm taking an
expense

02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
expense
 
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
against money that was granted to me to
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
stay alive
 
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh we're mixing we're confusing the
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
point the point is
 
02:28:12.790 --> 02:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's not an accounting issue it truly
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
was money that was needed from the
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
federal government to keep my business
 
02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:17.670 align:start position:0%
federal government to keep my business
alive

02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
alive
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
and and to mix that with i will be able
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
to take a deduction
 
02:28:25.270 --> 02:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
confuses the situation because quite
 
02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:26.630 align:start position:0%
confuses the situation because quite
honestly

02:28:26.630 --> 02:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
the money that was was given to me not
 
02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
only was given to me to stay alive
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's also been given to me to allow as
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
consumer confidence in my business
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
grows and and as we exit this pandemic
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
i've lost even more revenue that
 
02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
that i require for the for my for the
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
future of my business
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm speaking on behalf of a
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
businessman in the state
 
02:28:53.429 --> 02:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
who is gone through this process very
 
02:28:53.439 --> 02:28:54.309 align:start position:0%
who is gone through this process very
painfully

02:28:54.309 --> 02:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
painfully
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
none of us asked for this and the ppp
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
funds were critical
 
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
and as as i believe the accountant
 
02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:01.910 align:start position:0%
and as as i believe the accountant
stated

02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
stated
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day you don't have the
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
money to pay tax on top of the money
 
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
that you receive to stay alive
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
so if i can answer any questions
 
02:29:13.270 --> 02:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
relative i have gone i have just filed
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
for forgiveness
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
the process with my bank uh was
 
02:29:21.270 --> 02:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
very confusing uh but we we have gotten
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
through that we we weren't even allowed
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
to apply
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
until the beginning of march of this
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
year through my banking at lending
 
02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:28.790 align:start position:0%
year through my banking at lending
institution

02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
institution
 
02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
we did apply the bank went through that
 
02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:32.550 align:start position:0%
we did apply the bank went through that
process

02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
as i exited that process the bank
 
02:29:35.439 --> 02:29:35.990 align:start position:0%
as i exited that process the bank
basically

02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
sanitized all of my forgiveness 100
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
of the ppp funds i received went to
 
02:29:42.399 --> 02:29:43.190 align:start position:0%
of the ppp funds i received went to
payroll

02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
there were no other expenses it 100 went
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
to payroll
 
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then from that point it now goes to
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
the sba
 
02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm still not forgiven i've only gotten
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
through the bank process
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
now the sba has 90 days i have 10 months
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
from the time i was funded to actually
 
02:30:00.479 --> 02:30:01.349 align:start position:0%
from the time i was funded to actually
apply

02:30:01.349 --> 02:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
apply
 
02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
so i was kind of gated by the bank but
 
02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
we've met those guidelines
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
so hopefully i will receive forgiveness
 
02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
from the sba
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
and my loan will then turn to a grant if
 
02:30:13.110 --> 02:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
then starting september i will then be
 
02:30:19.270 --> 02:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
my loan will have to start to be repaid
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm hoping very much that
 
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
that the loan will be forgiven by the
 
02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
that the loan will be forgiven by the
sba

02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony mr ben
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
questions for mr benton
 
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman
 
02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh mr benton on
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
which what sector are you in i'm in the
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
health and fitness industry now
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
health and fitness thank you very much
 
02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:46.309 align:start position:0%
health and fitness thank you very much
and

02:30:46.309 --> 02:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
on you were in round one
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and they wouldn't you weren't
 
02:30:54.309 --> 02:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
allowed to apply for gift
 
02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
for forgiveness until march so
 
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
the websites were not available uh
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then when the second round hit the
 
02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
banks uh
 
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
were there was a lot of confusion with
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
the with the with my particular bank and
 
02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
i don't believe i'm
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh um uh an exception to this
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh so that we weren't really allowed or
 
02:31:16.469 --> 02:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
in a position to actually use their
 
02:31:16.479 --> 02:31:17.270 align:start position:0%
in a position to actually use their
website

02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
website
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
to start the forgiveness process
 
02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:21.510 align:start position:0%
to start the forgiveness process
representative

02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's really helpful
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
to know and
 
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for for
 
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
what you're going through the thing that
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out is the consumer
 
02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
confidence at least in my sector and i
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
think that's true for the hospitality
 
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
and restaurant sector is still not there
 
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
probably 30 percent of my business is
 
02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:43.030 align:start position:0%
probably 30 percent of my business is
gone

02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
gone
 
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
now i'm hoping to get that back and and
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a process
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
over time so these funds like i said
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're not just for the immediate to
 
02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
cover my
 
02:31:57.030 --> 02:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
there for my future so to pay tax
 
02:32:00.230 --> 02:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
on top of what we receive will be a huge
 
02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:00.870 align:start position:0%
on top of what we receive will be a huge
burden

02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
burden
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
other questions of mr benton
 
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh just a brief
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
question mr benton
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh i'm certain that you've been through
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
a struggle and i appreciate it and i
 
02:32:23.680 --> 02:32:24.070 align:start position:0%
a struggle and i appreciate it and i
applaud

02:32:24.070 --> 02:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
applaud
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
you if 100 of your pp loans
 
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
were used for payroll why do you fear
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
any exposure to tax on those funds
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
well the payroll is an expense so if you
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
take the opinion that
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's irrelevant whether i used it for
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
rent or used it for payroll i was able
 
02:32:47.429 --> 02:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
to deduct it
 
02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
and but i didn't look at the accounting
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
process of being able to deduct
 
02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:51.670 align:start position:0%
process of being able to deduct
something

02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that was
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
given as a as aid
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
to get me through the four months in
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
which i was shut down and there's where
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
i believe we're confusing accounting
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
principles with
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
what that money was truly intended to do
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
which was to give it to us to support
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
our businesses to keep us open to keep
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
our employees
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
off the the uh the unemployment rates
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
which by the way that's another very
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
important piece they gone to the
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
i would have never been able to open
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
back up in july
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
had i not kept those employees who knows
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
what would have happened
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
to try and get them back so it was
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
incredibly important for us to be able
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
to maintain
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
not just keep them off the unemployment
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
ranks but to basically have them
 
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
available as we when we open to back
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
up so and that is true with the second
 
02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:39.670 align:start position:0%
up so and that is true with the second
round

02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
round
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to maintain uh uh
 
02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
future and and as we continue to wait
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
for consumer confidence at least in our
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
industry and i believe that's true in
 
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
hospitality and restaurants
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
the restaurant industry to be able to
 
02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
wait for that consumer confidence to
 
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
come back
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
because i don't believe any of us back
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
in september thought january was going
 
02:33:59.830 --> 02:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
to be the month that it was in terms of
 
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
and that significantly impacted our
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
businesses again
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
so i i would hate to think that we
 
02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:07.990 align:start position:0%
so i i would hate to think that we
confuse

02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
confuse
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
accounting practices on how businesses
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
were able to retain these funds
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
with the need to retain them to keep our
 
02:34:15.990 --> 02:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
businesses whole
 
02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
not just for now but into the future
 
02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
because we've lost not just the revenue
 
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
we've lost the profits
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
and those profits allow us not just to
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
pay taxes they allow us to continue to
 
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
grow our businesses in the state
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
thank you are you all set representative
 
02:34:38.550 --> 02:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
all set thank you any further questions
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:49.830 --> 02:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
to testify for or against
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
saying then i'm going to ask the dra
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh if you would like
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:04.710 --> 02:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay we do i don't know okay
 
02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes are you hearing me okay yes yeah
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
um very very good seeing you all
 
02:35:22.710 --> 02:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to draw from my own
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
experience with the ppp
 
02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
i think representative spillsberry uh
 
02:35:32.710 --> 02:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
has uh the math correct um
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
i received a ppp as part of my business
 
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
to the extent that the employees that i
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
was able to retain with the ppp were
 
02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:44.389 align:start position:0%
was able to retain with the ppp were
productive

02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
productive
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know that becomes uh that becomes
 
02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.590 align:start position:0%
you know that becomes uh that becomes
profitable

02:35:51.590 --> 02:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
profitable
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
and um to the extent
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
that there would be no business i would
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
have been able to write off
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
and it did write off all of those uh
 
02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:02.469 align:start position:0%
and it did write off all of those uh
expenses

02:36:02.469 --> 02:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh last year and i would not be paying
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
any bpt uh on on the ppp money that i
 
02:36:10.479 --> 02:36:11.910 align:start position:0%
any bpt uh on on the ppp money that i
received

02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
um what the mechanism for
 
02:36:18.070 --> 02:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
receiving um uh the funds and the
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
forgiveness i did receive
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
the funds last year uh it went into the
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
books as alone
 
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh his uh it was still officially alone
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
as of the first of the year
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
as the loan forgiveness paperwork um
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't completed until march so it'll
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
show up as
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
non-taxable for federal purposes in my
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
2021 uh income but all the payroll and
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
everything that uh
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
and other um uh expenses that were part
 
02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
of the justification for the ppp
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh what actually um was incurred
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
last year um
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know personally i have no problem
 
02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:06.870 align:start position:0%
you know personally i have no problem
paying

02:37:06.870 --> 02:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
paying
 
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
um uh business profit tax
 
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh in in the state of new hampshire uh
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the apportioned part of the revenue
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's associated with new hampshire
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
because you know that those funds really
 
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
came in
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much similar to the way that any
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
other grant or revenue comes into the
 
02:37:28.479 --> 02:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
other grant or revenue comes into the
business

02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
and it was very helpful and appreciated
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh and to the extent um uh
 
02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
that uh you know the rest of the
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
revenues and profits uh held up
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'd be paying the same amount of same
 
02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
amount of tax
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think there would be a difference you
 
02:37:48.870 --> 02:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
know for for a struggling business with
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
a bet
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
which you can pay even if you're you're
 
02:37:52.479 --> 02:37:55.270 align:start position:0%
which you can pay even if you're you're
um

02:37:55.270 --> 02:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
even if you're unprofitable so
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know while past speakers have
 
02:38:05.190 --> 02:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
talked about you know the ability to
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
retain profits is important for future
 
02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:08.710 align:start position:0%
retain profits is important for future
growth

02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
growth
 
02:38:12.790 --> 02:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
i think um uh i'm okay keeping
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh most of it and
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
paying some some for the state for the
 
02:38:18.479 --> 02:38:19.750 align:start position:0%
paying some some for the state for the
opportunity

02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
to thrive and succeed in the granite
 
02:38:22.479 --> 02:38:23.429 align:start position:0%
to thrive and succeed in the granite
state

02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
and you know i think the pro
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
program worked pretty well and it
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't need to be tax-free
 
02:38:35.349 --> 02:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh to um uh to meet its purpose
 
02:38:38.790 --> 02:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh in fact but in in part by making it
 
02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh taxable uh for those that it really
 
02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:42.790 align:start position:0%
uh taxable uh for those that it really
helped

02:38:42.790 --> 02:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
helped
 
02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
provide a lifeline to they wouldn't be
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
paying b
 
02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh bpt anyway and for those who it was
 
02:38:50.230 --> 02:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
additional uh revenue and additional
 
02:38:53.670 --> 02:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
the bpt tax would go up a bit
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know like in light of what what i've
 
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
heard from the committee and from the
 
02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:05.990 align:start position:0%

i thought i would add my own perspective

02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
status quo that the uh
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
bpt uh the ppp not be deducted from the
 
02:40:24.479 --> 02:40:25.590 align:start position:0%
bpt uh the ppp not be deducted from the

02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
and i happen to have in front of me the
 
02:41:15.429 --> 02:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
2020 magazine
 
02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
i spill coffee on the cover so i no
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
longer have a cover
 
02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
on my copy but the it's a
 
02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
compilation of a magazine of all of
 
02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
companies of any size industries
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and on many of them
 
02:41:35.830 --> 02:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
it lists the number of employees
 
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
and it is probably the most easy to
 
02:41:39.120 --> 02:41:40.630 align:start position:0%
and it is probably the most easy to
obtain

02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
way to find out you know how big a
 
02:41:44.710 --> 02:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
company is
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
and it's very interesting how well the
 
02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:48.630 align:start position:0%
and it's very interesting how well the
top

02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
top
 
02:41:51.990 --> 02:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing companies in the state
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
are mostly foreign owned that have over
 
02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:56.830 align:start position:0%
are mostly foreign owned that have over
500

02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
500
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
employees and a tremendous number of
 
02:42:03.910 --> 02:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
employees are at dartmouth hitchcock and
 
02:42:05.590 --> 02:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
so forth but you can see
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
it it is very useful to have something
 
02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:09.269 align:start position:0%
it it is very useful to have something
that's

02:42:09.269 --> 02:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:42:11.269 --> 02:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
accessible that has the number of
 
02:42:11.279 --> 02:42:12.469 align:start position:0%
accessible that has the number of
employees

02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i think it's the easiest way
 
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's just very very accessible and
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
it has the names of the people
 
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
and their addresses and ownership so
 
02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's all together
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh in one place so they put it out every
 
02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:28.309 align:start position:0%
uh in one place so they put it out every
year

02:42:28.309 --> 02:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
and i don't know whether uh 2021 is out
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's not what i found i found 2020
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
but it's when i do a business story it's
 
02:42:43.030 --> 02:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
so that was just because i know everyone
 
02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
is interested in
 
02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
anybody else have a comment or question
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 3
 
02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:10.880 align:start position:0%

02:43:29.190 --> 02:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
carolyn and melissa are in but i also
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
see uh devin rodrick i'll
 
02:43:36.389 --> 02:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
i'll promote him as well good um
 
02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
is lindsay there too she doesn't appear
 
02:43:41.429 --> 02:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
to be anymore
 
02:43:41.439 --> 02:43:49.030 align:start position:0%
to be anymore
no

02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:57.750 --> 02:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
they raise their hand and they jump the
 
02:43:57.760 --> 02:43:58.950 align:start position:0%
they raise their hand and they jump the
alphabetical

02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
alphabetical
 
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
queue okay so now we have the staff of
 
02:44:05.269 --> 02:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
the dre
 
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
with us so lindsay do you have
 
02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:12.880 align:start position:0%

any comments to make or good afternoon
now

02:44:13.429 --> 02:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair members of the committee for
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
the record lindsey step
 
02:44:18.309 --> 02:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the new hampshire
 
02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
 
02:44:22.630 --> 02:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
i thought it would be helpful if you
 
02:44:24.870 --> 02:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
would indulge me for just a few minutes
 
02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
i was just going to walk through and
 
02:44:28.870 --> 02:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
confirm what i believe
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
is generally everyone's understanding
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
about the issue that we're talking about
 
02:44:32.479 --> 02:44:33.110 align:start position:0%
about the issue that we're talking about
here

02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i will also walk through the fiscal
 
02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:36.469 align:start position:0%
and i will also walk through the fiscal
note

02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
that the dra has completed and which you
 
02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
received a copy of our fiscal note quick
 
02:44:41.359 --> 02:44:43.510 align:start position:0%
received a copy of our fiscal note quick
guide

02:44:43.510 --> 02:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
guide
 
02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
so at a high level we are talking about
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
the taxability
 
02:44:50.469 --> 02:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
of forgiven ppp loans again importantly
 
02:44:51.750 --> 02:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
these are the loans that have been
 
02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:52.710 align:start position:0%
these are the loans that have been
forgiven

02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
and once they're forgiven there is
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
currently a difference between
 
02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
the tax treatment at the federal level
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
and at the state level
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
currently at the state level ppp loans
 
02:45:06.389 --> 02:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
that are forgiven become grants
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
and they are taxed the same as any other
 
02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:09.750 align:start position:0%
and they are taxed the same as any other
grant

02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
grant
 
02:45:11.670 --> 02:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
this means that the amount is included
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the businesses gross income
 
02:45:17.910 --> 02:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
and any amounts that are spent on
 
02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
deductible expenses such as wages
 
02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
can be deducted so the full amount of
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
the forgiven
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
ppp loan would come into gross income
 
02:45:29.830 --> 02:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
and in instances where
 
02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
all of that money was spent on
 
02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
deductible expenses
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
those expenses will be subtracted out
 
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the net
 
02:45:40.309 --> 02:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
impact to bpt will be zero
 
02:45:43.510 --> 02:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
um a tax tax would be paid on any
 
02:45:45.269 --> 02:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
amounts that were not spent
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
or were spent on non-deductible expenses
 
02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
although i
 
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
suspect that amounts spent on
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
non-deductible expenses would be minimal
 
02:45:55.269 --> 02:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
given um the purpose of the loans which
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
became grants
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
so that's the state treatment again
 
02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
coming into gross income
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
deductions for any expenses that are
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
deductible and then you're hitting
 
02:46:07.269 --> 02:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
bpt for anything that is not deductible
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
or that was not spent
 
02:46:12.550 --> 02:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
at the federal level ppp loans that have
 
02:46:13.349 --> 02:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
been forgiven
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
are not included in gross income so they
 
02:46:17.110 --> 02:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
never come into the gross income of the
 
02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:18.150 align:start position:0%
never come into the gross income of the
business

02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
but the expenses can still be deducted
 
02:46:21.750 --> 02:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
so anytime
 
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
um the loans were spent on wages or
 
02:46:25.510 --> 02:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
other deductible expenses
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
they would be subtracted from gross
 
02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
income but the grant or forgiven loan
 
02:46:31.349 --> 02:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
amount would not be included
 
02:46:33.030 --> 02:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
this essentially results in an
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
additional benefit
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to deduct
 
02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to deduct
expenses

02:46:37.990 --> 02:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
02:46:40.630 --> 02:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
which don't necessarily have an
 
02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:41.429 align:start position:0%
which don't necessarily have an
offsetting

02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
offsetting
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
amount in gross income so that's the
 
02:46:45.349 --> 02:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
difference between the state and the
 
02:46:46.309 --> 02:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
federal treatment
 
02:46:49.110 --> 02:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
so what senate bill 3 does is conform us
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
to the federal treatment
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
saying that the forgiven loan amounts
 
02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
the grants
 
02:46:57.910 --> 02:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
for ppp would not be in gross income
 
02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
but we would still businesses would
 
02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
still be able
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
to deduct the expenses i see a couple of
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
hands raised so
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair i think i'll pause there um to
 
02:47:09.990 --> 02:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
make sure we're all on the same page and
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
then i can talk about the fiscal note
 
02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative molloy
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
02:47:17.359 --> 02:47:18.870 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
for

02:47:18.870 --> 02:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:47:20.469 --> 02:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
allowing me to ask commissioner a
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
question here
 
02:47:25.269 --> 02:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh what you just read could you send
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
that to us in print
 
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
i would be more than happy to it's a
 
02:47:31.110 --> 02:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
nice bulleted list um i refer to it
 
02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:31.750 align:start position:0%
nice bulleted list um i refer to it
frequently

02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
02:47:37.910 --> 02:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you dennis uh repton here really
 
02:47:46.070 --> 02:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:49.110 --> 02:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
jeez the question i have we're
 
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
already in compliance with federal law
 
02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
and most of our other stuff i think we
 
02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
passed a couple of laws that brought
 
02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire up to uh current
 
02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
conformity with irs regulations
 
02:48:05.830 --> 02:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
so if we passed sb3 we would merely be
 
02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:06.710 align:start position:0%
so if we passed sb3 we would merely be
following

02:48:06.710 --> 02:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
following
 
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
the same path of trying to bring the two
 
02:48:13.269 --> 02:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh at least parallel or as close as
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
possible is
 
02:48:17.429 --> 02:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
is that a correct analysis misstep
 
02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so you're
 
02:48:21.030 --> 02:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
correct representative ulrie over the
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
past few years
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
um we have updated our conformity to the
 
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
internal revenue code
 
02:48:29.269 --> 02:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
so folks that have been on the committee
 
02:48:31.349 --> 02:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
for a long time will remember that
 
02:48:33.030 --> 02:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire went for a number of years
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
not updating um the internal revenue
 
02:48:37.349 --> 02:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
code that we reference
 
02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the past few years we have updated so
 
02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
we currently reference the code as of
 
02:48:44.950 --> 02:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
december 31st of 2018.
 
02:48:47.429 --> 02:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
we provide a memo to this committee
 
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
every year that talks about the
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
differences between the state
 
02:48:53.269 --> 02:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
and federal codes the current federal
 
02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
code and the state code that we
 
02:48:54.479 --> 02:48:55.269 align:start position:0%
code and the state code that we
reference

02:48:55.269 --> 02:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
reference
 
02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
i will note that when we do update our
 
02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
our conformity we do often
 
02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
what's called decouple from certain
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
provisions in the federal code
 
02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
we do that for two or three different
 
02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
provisions typically because the feds
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
have provided a very generous benefit
 
02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:13.349 align:start position:0%
have provided a very generous benefit
and

02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
given the makeup of our tax structure
 
02:49:17.830 --> 02:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
the potential fiscal impact is more
 
02:49:19.910 --> 02:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
than the legislature is willing to kind
 
02:49:22.230 --> 02:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
of swallow at that point
 
02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here you're
 
02:49:26.070 --> 02:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
correct that it is a difference between
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
the state and federal treatment
 
02:49:29.990 --> 02:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
this specific provision actually lives
 
02:49:32.230 --> 02:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
outside of the internal revenue code
 
02:49:35.750 --> 02:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's why we are needing to adopt
 
02:49:37.670 --> 02:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
um this uh federal treatment
 
02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
specifically in the language that is
 
02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:40.309 align:start position:0%
specifically in the language that is
referenced

02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
in senate bill 3. so that's exactly what
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 does is
 
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
it mirrors the federal treatment
 
02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
similar to what we would do in terms of
 
02:49:51.429 --> 02:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
when we are conforming
 
02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
i thank you misstep like i always tell
 
02:49:55.510 --> 02:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
people there are two ways to create
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
life one of which is to create law or
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
okay represent all me followed by
 
02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative brownlee
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner if on
 
02:50:17.269 --> 02:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
what what would happen
 
02:50:20.070 --> 02:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
if on we have a case like uh
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
ex-representative stringham square
 
02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
which seems like it's going to be very
 
02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:26.070 align:start position:0%
which seems like it's going to be very
common

02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
common
 
02:50:29.190 --> 02:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
on they had the expenses they
 
02:50:33.030 --> 02:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
they used the the loan to pay expenses
 
02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
which were deductible last year and
 
02:50:38.790 --> 02:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
even though they didn't have much
 
02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:39.510 align:start position:0%
even though they didn't have much
revenue

02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
or any revenue last year they filed and
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
they deducted the expenses
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
and then this year they finally get the
 
02:50:48.070 --> 02:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
loan forgiven
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
into a grant on
 
02:50:54.870 --> 02:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
would if we
 
02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
didn't do this would they then have to
 
02:51:00.630 --> 02:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
um they would not have had any
 
02:51:02.309 --> 02:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
deductible expenses to
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
weigh against it is what i'm trying to
 
02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:05.910 align:start position:0%
weigh against it is what i'm trying to
say

02:51:05.910 --> 02:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of conformity to the federal
 
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
treatment and regardless of senate bill
 
02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:11.429 align:start position:0%
treatment and regardless of senate bill
3

02:51:11.429 --> 02:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
3
 
02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
those expenses still remain deductible
 
02:51:15.590 --> 02:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're spent on wages
 
02:51:18.150 --> 02:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
rent general expenses that operate your
 
02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
business so
 
02:51:20.950 --> 02:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
there is we're not talking about any
 
02:51:22.469 --> 02:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
change as to whether or not
 
02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
expenses are deductible the only thing
 
02:51:26.230 --> 02:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is whether or not
 
02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:26.630 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is whether or not
that

02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:29.590 --> 02:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
forgiven loan or that grant should be
 
02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
treated like other grants and included
 
02:51:33.190 --> 02:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
in gross income
 
02:51:35.670 --> 02:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
or if you want to allow for a specific
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
exception to ppp grants
 
02:51:39.510 --> 02:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
and have them not included in gross
 
02:51:41.349 --> 02:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
income so really the only thing that
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is whether or not
 
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
that forgiven ppp amount
 
02:51:46.710 --> 02:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
goes in that top gross line a gross
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
income number
 
02:51:52.230 --> 02:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you grandfather follow-up what i
 
02:51:53.349 --> 02:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
was talking about
 
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
was on if you're in
 
02:52:00.469 --> 02:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
on ex-representative stringham's shoes
 
02:52:03.670 --> 02:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
and you reported the the expenses were
 
02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:04.230 align:start position:0%
and you reported the the expenses were
made

02:52:04.230 --> 02:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
made
 
02:52:07.590 --> 02:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
in 20 in tax year 20.
 
02:52:10.630 --> 02:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
and but the the grant
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
occurs in 21 because it was a loan
 
02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:14.870 align:start position:0%
occurs in 21 because it was a loan
before

02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:52:19.110 --> 02:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
are they allowed to take 2020 expenses
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
and deduct them in 2021
 
02:52:24.870 --> 02:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
they will not um those expenses will
 
02:52:26.550 --> 02:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
remain deductible in 20
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
and i think there's going to be a number
 
02:52:29.830 --> 02:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
of different issues here and it's going
 
02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
to be potentially on a taxpayer
 
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
tax payer by taxpayer basis there was
 
02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
guidance put out by the irs
 
02:52:39.269 --> 02:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
that encouraged taxpayers that if they
 
02:52:41.830 --> 02:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
reasonably believed that their ppp loan
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
was going to be forgiven
 
02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
that they could assume that forgiveness
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
in 20.
 
02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
um obviously unclear as to whether or
 
02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
not all
 
02:52:52.309 --> 02:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers followed that guidance and
 
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
there may have been a variety of reasons
 
02:52:55.990 --> 02:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
why they did or did not
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
also it could depend on the accounting
 
02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:00.070 align:start position:0%
also it could depend on the accounting
methodologies

02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
methodologies
 
02:53:01.990 --> 02:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
and various ways that taxpayers keep
 
02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
their books and records
 
02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
to determine where exactly the loan
 
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
forgiveness and the expenses will fall
 
02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
so this is something that the cpas and
 
02:53:13.110 --> 02:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
tax preparers will need to work with
 
02:53:14.070 --> 02:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
businesses on
 
02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of appropriately accounting for
 
02:53:17.830 --> 02:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
the expenses
 
02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
and also for the potential loan
 
02:53:19.439 --> 02:53:23.429 align:start position:0%
and also for the potential loan
forgiveness

02:53:23.429 --> 02:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:26.230 --> 02:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative browning thank you mr uh
 
02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner steph for uh uh providing
 
02:53:30.630 --> 02:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
so yes we had this discussion a couple
 
02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
years ago about conforming and not
 
02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:35.429 align:start position:0%
years ago about conforming and not
conforming

02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
conforming
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
and we decided not to conform uh it'd be
 
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
a couple years behind
 
02:53:41.750 --> 02:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
and all of what you just said about
 
02:53:44.550 --> 02:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
notifying us every year
 
02:53:47.429 --> 02:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
the good example was section 179 which
 
02:53:48.469 --> 02:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
was the accelerated
 
02:53:50.950 --> 02:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
depreciation was the amount that was it
 
02:53:52.469 --> 02:53:52.479 align:start position:0%
was really high
 
02:53:54.550 --> 02:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
for the federal level and not too high
 
02:53:55.750 --> 02:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh so so on march 3rd 2020 when this
 
02:54:03.429 --> 02:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
bill was signed into law
 
02:54:06.790 --> 02:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
all those conforming states became
 
02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh conformed with this ppp change
 
02:54:12.469 --> 02:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
or because there was no statute on the
 
02:54:14.070 --> 02:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
law that said that we would forgive
 
02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
anything it was just specific to this
 
02:54:21.429 --> 02:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
particular provision is that correct
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
correct so states that have rolling
 
02:54:24.710 --> 02:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
conformity and just
 
02:54:26.630 --> 02:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
kind of roll with the punches if you
 
02:54:28.469 --> 02:54:28.479 align:start position:0%
will of the federal
 
02:54:32.309 --> 02:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
internal revenue code changes they did
 
02:54:34.710 --> 02:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
essentially generally conform to this
 
02:54:35.670 --> 02:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
tax treatment
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
even though this does technically live
 
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
outside of the internal revenue code
 
02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
those states have just adopted the
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
policy that we follow the federal
 
02:54:43.439 --> 02:54:44.230 align:start position:0%
policy that we follow the federal
treatment

02:54:44.230 --> 02:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
for taxes states that are not rolling
 
02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
conformity like new hampshire and many
 
02:54:49.910 --> 02:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
others are having these exact
 
02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:51.349 align:start position:0%
others are having these exact
discussions

02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
02:54:53.110 --> 02:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
where there is a decision whether to
 
02:54:55.110 --> 02:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
affirmatively adopt this federal
 
02:54:55.120 --> 02:54:55.910 align:start position:0%
affirmatively adopt this federal
treatment

02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
or not and so that's why you see
 
02:55:00.870 --> 02:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
that there are some states that have not
 
02:55:02.550 --> 02:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
yet adopted this treatment new hampshire
 
02:55:03.510 --> 02:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
being one of them
 
02:55:05.670 --> 02:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
and why if you look back over time if
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
you find older news articles
 
02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see that in the beginning it was
 
02:55:11.750 --> 02:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
x number of states and over time
 
02:55:13.990 --> 02:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
more and more states have adopted that's
 
02:55:15.670 --> 02:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
because those non-rolling conformity
 
02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:16.230 align:start position:0%
because those non-rolling conformity
states

02:55:16.230 --> 02:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:55:17.830 --> 02:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
have made the affirmative decision
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
through legislation that's passed
 
02:55:20.870 --> 02:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
through their house in their senate and
 
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
ultimately signed by their governor
 
02:55:25.830 --> 02:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
to adopt this federal treatment okay
 
02:55:27.990 --> 02:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so that's
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
interesting so they didn't automatically
 
02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:30.950 align:start position:0%
interesting so they didn't automatically
conform

02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
conform
 
02:55:33.349 --> 02:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
they they just they chose to conform
 
02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
right rolling conformity
 
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
essentially did automatically conform
 
02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
but those states like new hampshire that
 
02:55:39.429 --> 02:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
are static conformity
 
02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
when we adopt as a specific date those
 
02:55:43.030 --> 02:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
states are making this decisions
 
02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:43.990 align:start position:0%
states are making this decisions
individually

02:55:43.990 --> 02:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
individually
 
02:55:47.429 --> 02:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
02:55:50.230 --> 02:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury thank you mr
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
02:55:53.110 --> 02:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
this step that last discussion you just
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
had with representative obama he
 
02:55:58.870 --> 02:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
anticipates my question so i'm sure
 
02:55:58.880 --> 02:55:59.429 align:start position:0%
anticipates my question so i'm sure
you're

02:55:59.429 --> 02:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:56:02.070 --> 02:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
following those states which did not
 
02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
have rolling conformity and are
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
making uh going through the same
 
02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:07.830 align:start position:0%
making uh going through the same
discussion

02:56:07.830 --> 02:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:56:10.230 --> 02:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any insights to what
 
02:56:10.240 --> 02:56:11.030 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any insights to what
extent

02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
extent
 
02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
the discussion in those states is
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
factoring in their ability
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
to draw a degree of offsetting income
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
through the individual income
 
02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
tax so that where ppp funds have been
 
02:56:26.399 --> 02:56:27.110 align:start position:0%
tax so that where ppp funds have been
used

02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh to make payroll um there is
 
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
a a tax uh recipe to the state
 
02:56:36.550 --> 02:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
on that or in fact as employees and
 
02:56:37.349 --> 02:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
others use
 
02:56:40.550 --> 02:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the money spent in ppp
 
02:56:42.309 --> 02:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
to go out and make purchases there may
 
02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
be a sales tax
 
02:56:47.110 --> 02:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
maybe harder to quantify a little bit
 
02:56:49.269 --> 02:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
less direct but still
 
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh clearly there um so i'm i guess i'm
 
02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
asking you to tell us
 
02:56:56.550 --> 02:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
whether you're able to gauge how much of
 
02:56:58.150 --> 02:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
a factor
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
those offsetting revenue sources have
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
been in other states who have those
 
02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:03.990 align:start position:0%
been in other states who have those
sources

02:57:03.990 --> 02:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
sources
 
02:57:06.070 --> 02:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
i can't gauge thank you for the question
 
02:57:07.030 --> 02:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
i can't gauge
 
02:57:10.630 --> 02:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
specifically um as to whether or not
 
02:57:14.230 --> 02:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
those other states have necessarily
 
02:57:16.469 --> 02:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that if they don't tax it
 
02:57:17.830 --> 02:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
at the corporate level
 
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
that there is still tax coming in as you
 
02:57:21.750 --> 02:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the individual
 
02:57:23.510 --> 02:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
income tax level especially to the
 
02:57:25.349 --> 02:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
extent that the amounts were spent on
 
02:57:25.359 --> 02:57:26.230 align:start position:0%
extent that the amounts were spent on
wages

02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
wages
 
02:57:28.389 --> 02:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
and at the sales tax level to the extent
 
02:57:30.070 --> 02:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
that the employees then continue to
 
02:57:32.230 --> 02:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
purchase things within the economy
 
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
um however what
 
02:57:39.429 --> 02:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
however their revenue picture or their
 
02:57:39.439 --> 02:57:40.070 align:start position:0%
however their revenue picture or their
fiscal

02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
02:57:43.269 --> 02:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
impact when looking at the impact of
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
conforming to the federal treatment is
 
02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
different than the revenue
 
02:57:49.030 --> 02:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
impact that you're going to see here in
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so
 
02:57:53.030 --> 02:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
when my counterpart in another state
 
02:57:53.990 --> 02:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
that has an income
 
02:57:55.590 --> 02:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
individual income tax broad-based
 
02:57:57.269 --> 02:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
individual income tax and a broad-based
 
02:57:58.550 --> 02:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
02:58:01.670 --> 02:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
is looking at the overall fiscal impact
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
it is going to look different than here
 
02:58:04.870 --> 02:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:58:08.230 --> 02:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
because while we have the negatives for
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and other
 
02:58:12.469 --> 02:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
states would as well for their corporate
 
02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
income tax
 
02:58:16.230 --> 02:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
we have a small corresponding
 
02:58:18.309 --> 02:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
positive impact with bet which i'll talk
 
02:58:20.150 --> 02:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
about when we get to the fiscal note
 
02:58:22.230 --> 02:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
and other in states with a broad-based
 
02:58:23.190 --> 02:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
income tax
 
02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
individual income tax would have a
 
02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
larger impact
 
02:58:29.110 --> 02:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
positive impact at the individual income
 
02:58:29.910 --> 02:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
tax level
 
02:58:31.910 --> 02:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
and again at the sales tax level to the
 
02:58:33.429 --> 02:58:33.439 align:start position:0%
extent that they are able to quantify it
 
02:58:34.630 --> 02:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
as you said it's probably a little bit
 
02:58:35.750 --> 02:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
more difficult
 
02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
so their overall fiscal impact is going
 
02:58:39.510 --> 02:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
to look different than it does here in
 
02:58:40.950 --> 02:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:58:42.550 --> 02:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
and that would probably would inform
 
02:58:44.830 --> 02:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
their decision about whether or not to
 
02:58:44.840 --> 02:58:46.230 align:start position:0%
their decision about whether or not to
conform

02:58:46.230 --> 02:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
conform
 
02:58:48.309 --> 02:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so the reciprocal point i
 
02:58:49.750 --> 02:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
suppose then would be
 
02:58:53.190 --> 02:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire had either or both
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
a personal income tax or a sales tax
 
02:58:57.269 --> 02:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
your fiscal note would look different
 
02:58:59.110 --> 02:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
correct and like i said when we start
 
02:59:00.469 --> 02:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
when i walk you through the fiscal note
 
02:59:02.710 --> 02:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
you you will see there is a positive
 
02:59:04.630 --> 02:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
impact for the business enterprise tax
 
02:59:06.309 --> 02:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
because wages are taxable under the
 
02:59:07.590 --> 02:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
02:59:09.750 --> 02:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
but given that it is a much lower rate
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
than a typical individual income tax
 
02:59:11.680 --> 02:59:12.070 align:start position:0%
than a typical individual income tax
rate

02:59:12.070 --> 02:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
rate
 
02:59:15.429 --> 02:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
it's a smaller positive offset
 
02:59:18.710 --> 02:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that question
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
but uh any further questions
 
02:59:28.389 --> 02:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
then why don't you continue uh
 
02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
sure happy too so the other thing that i
 
02:59:33.510 --> 02:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to do with you today
 
02:59:36.389 --> 02:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
was walk through our fiscal note and how
 
02:59:38.469 --> 02:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
we arrived at the fiscal impact
 
02:59:40.710 --> 02:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
so before we get started a couple things
 
02:59:41.590 --> 02:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
to know
 
02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have identified that
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
our fiscal note has
 
02:59:47.830 --> 02:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
had a bit of an evolution over uh the
 
02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
process as senate bill 3 has made its
 
02:59:51.030 --> 02:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
way through both
 
02:59:54.309 --> 02:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
the senate and now into the house i will
 
02:59:56.710 --> 02:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
note that our first attempt at a fiscal
 
02:59:57.910 --> 02:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
note for this bill
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
did have a revenue impact of
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
approximately negative 80 million to a
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
negative 135 million
 
03:00:07.910 --> 03:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
um two things to note about that fiscal
 
03:00:10.389 --> 03:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
note one it was extremely complicated
 
03:00:13.510 --> 03:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
um and very difficult in order for us to
 
03:00:13.520 --> 03:00:14.469 align:start position:0%
um and very difficult in order for us to
convey

03:00:14.469 --> 03:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
convey
 
03:00:16.630 --> 03:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
um all of the intricacies of how that
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was derived
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
the second thing i will note is we heard
 
03:00:21.910 --> 03:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
some testimony in the senate
 
03:00:24.790 --> 03:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
um that um question some of our
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
methodology on that fiscal note
 
03:00:29.190 --> 03:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
we take that testimony seriously and so
 
03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
we kind of went back to the drawing
 
03:00:30.640 --> 03:00:31.269 align:start position:0%
we kind of went back to the drawing
board

03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:00:33.269 --> 03:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
hearing some of the feedback and we're
 
03:00:34.870 --> 03:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
always happy to hear feedback
 
03:00:37.590 --> 03:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
so we went back to the drawing board and
 
03:00:37.600 --> 03:00:38.230 align:start position:0%
so we went back to the drawing board and
developed

03:00:38.230 --> 03:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
developed
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
a more simple and we believe
 
03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
a slightly more accurate fiscal note
 
03:00:46.710 --> 03:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
the methodology that i'm going to
 
03:00:48.230 --> 03:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
present to you this morning or this
 
03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:49.030 align:start position:0%
present to you this morning or this
afternoon

03:00:49.030 --> 03:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
03:00:52.070 --> 03:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
is our updated methodology and in the
 
03:00:52.870 --> 03:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
senate that
 
03:00:55.630 --> 03:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
produced a fiscal impact of a loss of
 
03:00:57.670 --> 03:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
65.1 million
 
03:00:59.190 --> 03:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see what you have in front of you
 
03:01:02.550 --> 03:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
today has a loss of 91.7 million
 
03:01:05.389 --> 03:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
the only difference there is that the
 
03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
65.1 million
 
03:01:11.349 --> 03:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
was using total ppp um
 
03:01:15.510 --> 03:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
loans as of august 8th of 2020.
 
03:01:18.870 --> 03:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
we have now updated the total ppp amount
 
03:01:21.590 --> 03:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
to reflect those loans issued as of
 
03:01:22.790 --> 03:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
april 18th
 
03:01:26.550 --> 03:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
of 2021. so it's just
 
03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
essentially updating the base of where
 
03:01:29.910 --> 03:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're starting from
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
to account for essentially the second
 
03:01:33.510 --> 03:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
round of ppp loans
 
03:01:35.670 --> 03:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
that have been issued and again we're
 
03:01:37.110 --> 03:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
only talking about ppp
 
03:01:38.870 --> 03:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
loans that have been issued through
 
03:01:40.150 --> 03:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
april 18th
 
03:01:42.070 --> 03:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
so this analysis does not contemplate
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
the additional 30 billion or so
 
03:01:46.469 --> 03:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
um that is still remaining that could
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:53.590 --> 03:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the fiscal note as i said starts with
 
03:01:54.630 --> 03:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
total ppp
 
03:01:57.750 --> 03:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
issued as of april 18 2021
 
03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
which is 762 billion dollars
 
03:02:05.830 --> 03:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
we then subtract out 20 percent
 
03:02:09.750 --> 03:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
for ppp that was issued to nonprofits
 
03:02:11.910 --> 03:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
and to businesses that are under our
 
03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
taxable thresholds of fifty thousand
 
03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:14.550 align:start position:0%
taxable thresholds of fifty thousand
dollars

03:02:14.550 --> 03:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:02:17.429 --> 03:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
that twenty 20 number is an assumption
 
03:02:17.439 --> 03:02:17.990 align:start position:0%
that twenty 20 number is an assumption
um

03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
and that's based on our general review
 
03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
of the data for ppp
 
03:02:23.670 --> 03:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
loans that were issued to new hampshire
 
03:02:26.230 --> 03:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
businesses only
 
03:02:28.150 --> 03:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'll pause here for a second you'll hear
 
03:02:30.309 --> 03:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
me say multiple times as i go through
 
03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
this that there's a lot of assumptions
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
so we are making a lot of assumptions
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
about the data
 
03:02:38.630 --> 03:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
the data that we receive from the small
 
03:02:40.389 --> 03:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
business administration is the same data
 
03:02:41.910 --> 03:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
that is available to
 
03:02:45.269 --> 03:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
you and to the public we don't have
 
03:02:47.990 --> 03:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer identification numbers so we're
 
03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
not able to tie the data specifically
 
03:02:54.150 --> 03:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
back to our individual tax records
 
03:02:57.110 --> 03:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
to know how certain businesses this
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
might ultimately flow into their tax
 
03:02:59.040 --> 03:02:59.910 align:start position:0%
might ultimately flow into their tax
return

03:02:59.910 --> 03:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
return
 
03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
so we're not using necessarily any of
 
03:03:05.110 --> 03:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
our data or our specific information
 
03:03:05.120 --> 03:03:05.590 align:start position:0%
our data or our specific information
about

03:03:05.590 --> 03:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in order to arrive at this
 
03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:08.630 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in order to arrive at this
analysis

03:03:08.630 --> 03:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
03:03:10.830 --> 03:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
so we are making a lot of general
 
03:03:10.840 --> 03:03:12.630 align:start position:0%
so we are making a lot of general
assumptions

03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
assumptions
 
03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
so taking the 762 billion subtracting
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
again 20 percent being those businesses
 
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
that are below our bpt
 
03:03:21.510 --> 03:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
threshold and also those businesses that
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
are not subject to bpt because they're
 
03:03:23.279 --> 03:03:24.710 align:start position:0%
are not subject to bpt because they're
non-profits

03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
03:03:28.469 --> 03:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
that arrives at 610 billion dollars
 
03:03:31.269 --> 03:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
and the next thing we do is apply a 0.4
 
03:03:31.279 --> 03:03:32.070 align:start position:0%
and the next thing we do is apply a 0.4
percent

03:03:32.070 --> 03:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
apportionment to new hampshire
 
03:03:37.030 --> 03:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
i've heard the committee this morning
 
03:03:38.870 --> 03:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
talk a lot about new hampshire
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
businesses that have received ppp
 
03:03:43.590 --> 03:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
and those businesses are certainly very
 
03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
likely to be subject to tax here in new
 
03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:46.389 align:start position:0%
likely to be subject to tax here in new
hampshire

03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:03:48.950 --> 03:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
you also have businesses whose address
 
03:03:49.510 --> 03:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
is not
 
03:03:51.510 --> 03:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that may still be
 
03:03:53.110 --> 03:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
subject to tax here
 
03:03:55.510 --> 03:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
regional new england businesses you may
 
03:03:57.750 --> 03:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
have a business in massachusetts
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
that owns property or locations in both
 
03:04:02.150 --> 03:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
states but their headquarters are in
 
03:04:02.160 --> 03:04:03.670 align:start position:0%
states but their headquarters are in
massachusetts

03:04:03.670 --> 03:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
03:04:05.510 --> 03:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
so those businesses wouldn't show when
 
03:04:07.190 --> 03:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at the new hampshire
 
03:04:09.349 --> 03:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
data so that's why we start with the
 
03:04:10.309 --> 03:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
whole pot
 
03:04:12.150 --> 03:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
of total ppp because we could have
 
03:04:14.070 --> 03:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
businesses across the country
 
03:04:16.389 --> 03:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
that received ppp that apportioned to
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and therefore
 
03:04:20.790 --> 03:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
file a tax return here in new hampshire
 
03:04:23.910 --> 03:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
so that point four percent is a number
 
03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
that we've used routinely over the years
 
03:04:28.870 --> 03:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's generally based on population but
 
03:04:30.550 --> 03:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's a way that any time we're looking
 
03:04:32.070 --> 03:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
at a national number
 
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
if we want to um decide or try to
 
03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:35.670 align:start position:0%
if we want to um decide or try to
approximate

03:04:35.670 --> 03:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
approximate
 
03:04:37.590 --> 03:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
what portion is attributable to new
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire we use 0.4 percent
 
03:04:41.750 --> 03:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
so again a number you may have seen in
 
03:04:43.510 --> 03:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
our fiscal notes in the past and again
 
03:04:45.030 --> 03:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's just trying to say
 
03:04:47.429 --> 03:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
total united states what portion is new
 
03:04:47.439 --> 03:04:48.630 align:start position:0%
total united states what portion is new
hampshire

03:04:48.630 --> 03:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:04:52.309 --> 03:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
so applying that 0.4 you arrive at 2.4
 
03:04:52.319 --> 03:04:52.870 align:start position:0%
so applying that 0.4 you arrive at 2.4
billion

03:04:52.870 --> 03:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
billion
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that is our estimate of total ppp
 
03:05:01.510 --> 03:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
that could be taxable here in new
 
03:05:01.520 --> 03:05:02.790 align:start position:0%
that could be taxable here in new
hampshire

03:05:02.790 --> 03:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
again would not include anyone that's
 
03:05:07.110 --> 03:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
not subject to the bpt
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
and does include businesses outside of
 
03:05:11.190 --> 03:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire did a portion here
 
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
so the first thing we do is apply the
 
03:05:13.600 --> 03:05:15.190 align:start position:0%
so the first thing we do is apply the
7.7

03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
7.7
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
bpt rate to the 2.4 billion
 
03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
and that results in just under 185
 
03:05:22.720 --> 03:05:23.670 align:start position:0%
and that results in just under 185
million

03:05:23.670 --> 03:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:05:27.269 --> 03:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
of additional benefit that businesses
 
03:05:28.710 --> 03:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
would receive
 
03:05:31.830 --> 03:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
if ppp for given ppp loans were not
 
03:05:34.870 --> 03:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
included in gross income
 
03:05:36.710 --> 03:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
we then start to whittle that number
 
03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
down so the next thing we do
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
is assume that 80 of that amount
 
03:05:46.389 --> 03:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
was spent on wages and therefore would
 
03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
be subject to the bet
 
03:05:51.990 --> 03:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
again the 80 is more than the 60 percent
 
03:05:53.830 --> 03:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
that was required under the program but
 
03:05:55.510 --> 03:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard some testimony this morning
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
that many businesses did
 
03:05:59.990 --> 03:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
primarily spend these amounts on wages
 
03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
so we have assumed a slightly higher
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
percent at eighty percent
 
03:06:07.030 --> 03:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
so if eighty percent of
 
03:06:09.429 --> 03:06:09.439 align:start position:0%
the two point four billion was spent on
 
03:06:11.429 --> 03:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
wages that gives you two billion dollars
 
03:06:12.630 --> 03:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
spent on wages
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
using the bet rate of 0.6 percent
 
03:06:18.790 --> 03:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
results in a bet liability of 11.7
 
03:06:18.800 --> 03:06:20.469 align:start position:0%
results in a bet liability of 11.7
million

03:06:20.469 --> 03:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:06:23.190 --> 03:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
so we take that 11.7 million and we
 
03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:23.910 align:start position:0%
so we take that 11.7 million and we
reduce

03:06:23.910 --> 03:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
03:06:27.510 --> 03:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
that uh or take that away from 185
 
03:06:27.520 --> 03:06:29.030 align:start position:0%
that uh or take that away from 185
million

03:06:29.030 --> 03:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:06:32.670 --> 03:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
of the initial bpt loss which results in
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
173.1 million
 
03:06:37.110 --> 03:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
so again you had a loss but as
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry mentioned
 
03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
there is some benefit there because we
 
03:06:42.309 --> 03:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
have that tax
 
03:06:45.030 --> 03:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
on the wages so we've reduced that loss
 
03:06:45.040 --> 03:06:46.150 align:start position:0%
on the wages so we've reduced that loss
by

03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
the 11.7 million
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
the next thing we do is um acknowledge
 
03:06:56.469 --> 03:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
that we have businesses the way that our
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
bet mbpt
 
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
taxes interact we have businesses
 
03:07:05.590 --> 03:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
who absent bet would pay bpt
 
03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
but because bet isn't credit against bpt
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
the only thing they pay is bad and so
 
03:07:12.790 --> 03:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
experience this additional benefit
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
because their bet is in excess of their
 
03:07:19.439 --> 03:07:20.309 align:start position:0%
because their bet is in excess of their
bpt

03:07:20.309 --> 03:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
bpt
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
so they always pay more in debt than
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
their bpt liability
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
so they always offset each other and
 
03:07:28.389 --> 03:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
based on our analysis looking at our
 
03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
data this is the one place where we
 
03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
really dug into our data
 
03:07:34.389 --> 03:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
approximately 47
 
03:07:38.070 --> 03:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
of our taxpayers are bet only taxpayers
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
so again this additional benefit that
 
03:07:42.790 --> 03:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
would be available
 
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
under the bpt would not impact these
 
03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because they only pay back
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
so we take that reduced 173.1
 
03:07:55.510 --> 03:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
million apply the 47 percent
 
03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
and that's how we get to the 91.7
 
03:07:57.840 --> 03:08:00.389 align:start position:0%
and that's how we get to the 91.7
million

03:08:00.389 --> 03:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
so again at a high level we took total
 
03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:04.830 align:start position:0%
so again at a high level we took total
ppp

03:08:04.830 --> 03:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
ppp
 
03:08:08.070 --> 03:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
determined the portion that we believed
 
03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
would be subject to the business profits
 
03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.550 align:start position:0%
would be subject to the business profits
tax

03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
we apportioned it to new hampshire
 
03:08:20.309 --> 03:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
applied the bpt rate creating our loss
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
reduce that loss by the bet that was
 
03:08:23.910 --> 03:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
generated because
 
03:08:26.150 --> 03:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
these amounts were spent on wages and
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
then accounted for those taxpayers that
 
03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
only pay bet
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
and are not bpt taxpayers and that's how
 
03:08:34.389 --> 03:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
we arrive at the 91.7 million
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
again using total ppp issued through
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
i will stop there and happy to answer
 
03:08:52.230 --> 03:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:56.230 --> 03:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
oh it looks like it looks like norm
 
03:09:01.110 --> 03:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:03.910 --> 03:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
well i'll i'll i'll i'll assume the
 
03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
chair here roll here and i've got a
 
03:09:05.840 --> 03:09:07.030 align:start position:0%
chair here roll here and i've got a
question

03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:09:10.469 --> 03:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
no uh is norm back
 
03:09:13.990 --> 03:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
no okay uh commissioner um
 
03:09:16.870 --> 03:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
we all got uh an email from uh you folks
 
03:09:18.870 --> 03:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
it was either yesterday or this morning
 
03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
um talking about the second draw
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh which started in uh uh was enacted at
 
03:09:29.110 --> 03:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
the end of december and it goes to may
 
03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:30.710 align:start position:0%
the end of december and it goes to may
31st

03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
31st
 
03:09:33.670 --> 03:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
so and new hampshire's portion of that
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
was going to be 290 billion
 
03:09:39.750 --> 03:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
of additional loans uh and
 
03:09:42.550 --> 03:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
the email said that 240 billion has
 
03:09:44.070 --> 03:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
already been awarded
 
03:09:45.670 --> 03:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
now we just heard testimony from bank
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
association she threw out a number 30
 
03:09:50.309 --> 03:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
billion but i we know that's fluid so
 
03:09:53.030 --> 03:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
but let's say it's 50 billion that still
 
03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:53.510 align:start position:0%
but let's say it's 50 billion that still
still

03:09:53.510 --> 03:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
still
 
03:09:57.269 --> 03:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone out as yet um
 
03:10:00.550 --> 03:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
so when when we look at the date on your
 
03:10:03.510 --> 03:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
your in the fiscal note that your
 
03:10:04.830 --> 03:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
starting point that
 
03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
762 billion
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh was as of 418 the best of your
 
03:10:11.279 --> 03:10:12.630 align:start position:0%
uh was as of 418 the best of your
knowledge

03:10:12.630 --> 03:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
03:10:15.670 --> 03:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh that that still unknown is the 50
 
03:10:15.680 --> 03:10:16.870 align:start position:0%
uh that that still unknown is the 50
billion

03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
billion
 
03:10:18.469 --> 03:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
as to whether those loans are going to
 
03:10:21.030 --> 03:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
be made and forgiven
 
03:10:25.110 --> 03:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh and so it would be very helpful to
 
03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
the committee i think
 
03:10:29.590 --> 03:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
that over the next week or two for us to
 
03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:31.429 align:start position:0%
that over the next week or two for us to
estimate

03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
03:10:34.870 --> 03:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
how much of that 50 billion
 
03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh i would assume it would it would make
 
03:10:41.910 --> 03:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:43.110 --> 03:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
because there's still 50 billion
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
unaccounted for so far as i can see
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh that may
 
03:10:51.750 --> 03:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
be forgiven uh
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's you know so can you just address
 
03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
that where we're at with that
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
whole analysis sure we'd be happy to um
 
03:11:01.910 --> 03:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
update the fiscal analysis assuming
 
03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:02.469 align:start position:0%
update the fiscal analysis assuming
again

03:11:02.469 --> 03:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
that the total of the second um
 
03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
random pp is issued it sound like
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
sounded like christy alluded to the fact
 
03:11:12.070 --> 03:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
that they believe that will be true so
 
03:11:13.510 --> 03:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
we can certainly update
 
03:11:16.630 --> 03:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes using the full amount
 
03:11:19.349 --> 03:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
the second thing i would note is that
 
03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
this analysis
 
03:11:24.070 --> 03:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
does assume that all ppp loans are
 
03:11:24.080 --> 03:11:26.070 align:start position:0%
does assume that all ppp loans are
forgiven

03:11:26.070 --> 03:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
03:11:31.510 --> 03:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
looking at data from the sva website
 
03:11:33.990 --> 03:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
is the best as i can decipher it it
 
03:11:34.950 --> 03:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
03:11:37.750 --> 03:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
to date for the forgiveness applications
 
03:11:39.190 --> 03:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
that they've processed
 
03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
only 0.3 percent have not been forgiven
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
um a very small percentage but i will
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
note that our analysis
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
does assume that everything that is
 
03:11:51.359 --> 03:11:52.469 align:start position:0%
does assume that everything that is
issued

03:11:52.469 --> 03:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
issued
 
03:11:56.309 --> 03:11:56.319 align:start position:0%
will be forgiven right okay so
 
03:11:59.830 --> 03:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
all right so um so even if
 
03:12:02.469 --> 03:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
even if in the next couple of weeks uh
 
03:12:03.429 --> 03:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
next week
 
03:12:05.830 --> 03:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
can you take the maximum amount and do
 
03:12:06.870 --> 03:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
your estimate
 
03:12:08.070 --> 03:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
certainly that's what's going to do and
 
03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
then we can assume it'll fall somewhere
 
03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:10.710 align:start position:0%
then we can assume it'll fall somewhere
between

03:12:10.710 --> 03:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:12:12.070 --> 03:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
where we're at now and the and the
 
03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
maximum amount okay thank you
 
03:12:18.389 --> 03:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
see uh chairman uh major everybody but i
 
03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
i had to drop off because i was frozen
 
03:12:24.389 --> 03:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
i couldn't communicate so i just came
 
03:12:24.399 --> 03:12:24.790 align:start position:0%
i couldn't communicate so i just came
back

03:12:24.790 --> 03:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:12:32.229 --> 03:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:35.670 --> 03:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
lindsay where are we right you had just
 
03:12:35.680 --> 03:12:36.630 align:start position:0%
lindsay where are we right you had just
completed

03:12:36.630 --> 03:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
completed
 
03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
the analysis of the 91.7 million
 
03:12:42.469 --> 03:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
correct and i was in the process of
 
03:12:44.550 --> 03:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
making a statement
 
03:12:46.550 --> 03:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
did you hear the statement i did not
 
03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
hear the statement so if you'd be
 
03:12:49.269 --> 03:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
willing to repeat that that would be
 
03:12:49.279 --> 03:12:50.309 align:start position:0%
willing to repeat that that would be
helpful

03:12:50.309 --> 03:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
03:12:55.030 --> 03:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:58.830 --> 03:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
your analysis based upon as of april
 
03:12:58.840 --> 03:12:59.990 align:start position:0%
your analysis based upon as of april
18th

03:12:59.990 --> 03:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
18th
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
and then we know that this
 
03:13:07.429 --> 03:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
long period extends to
 
03:13:11.110 --> 03:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
application to the end of may
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
but there's only 30 billion left and if
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
you multiply that by
 
03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
0.4 it's it's a small amount so it's not
 
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
affect the 91.7 million
 
03:13:25.910 --> 03:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
much is that a correct statement
 
03:13:27.429 --> 03:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
i believe that to be a correct statement
 
03:13:29.110 --> 03:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative abrami asked
 
03:13:30.870 --> 03:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
a similar question and i did agree to
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
update the analysis
 
03:13:36.389 --> 03:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
assuming that the total amount is issued
 
03:13:39.429 --> 03:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
so we can get you an updated number the
 
03:13:40.710 --> 03:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
other thing i did know
 
03:13:43.110 --> 03:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
is that the analysis does assume that
 
03:13:46.790 --> 03:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
all ppp will be forgiven
 
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the data that the sba has
 
03:13:51.990 --> 03:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
made available to date with respect
 
03:13:55.110 --> 03:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
to the processing of forgiveness it
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
appears as though
 
03:13:58.870 --> 03:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
only point three percent of loans that
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
have been processed for forgiveness
 
03:14:03.990 --> 03:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
have not been forgiven so it is a
 
03:14:06.070 --> 03:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
relatively low percentage of loans that
 
03:14:07.110 --> 03:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
are not forgiven
 
03:14:09.269 --> 03:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
so our again our analysis does assume
 
03:14:11.510 --> 03:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
that all ppp will be forgiven
 
03:14:13.750 --> 03:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
well that's pretty good as far as an
 
03:14:16.309 --> 03:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
analysis goes
 
03:14:20.150 --> 03:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
we know we could rely on you guys
 
03:14:23.269 --> 03:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
okay further questions of uh
 
03:14:26.790 --> 03:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
i can't see that if i put participants
 
03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:27.429 align:start position:0%
i can't see that if i put participants
up

03:14:27.429 --> 03:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:14:29.190 --> 03:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative ames followed by
 
03:14:33.349 --> 03:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:37.670 --> 03:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you um
 
03:14:40.950 --> 03:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
so first uh i guess this is a a question
 
03:14:41.910 --> 03:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
to the chair
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
um will there be a work session of
 
03:14:45.429 --> 03:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh
 
03:14:49.110 --> 03:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
to look more closely at
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
the um basically the fiscal note side of
 
03:14:53.590 --> 03:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
this the
 
03:14:56.630 --> 03:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
impact question
 
03:14:59.110 --> 03:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
excellent question there definitely will
 
03:15:00.150 --> 03:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
and there's probably
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
more than one work session because we
 
03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:03.190 align:start position:0%
more than one work session because we
still

03:15:03.190 --> 03:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
still
 
03:15:07.190 --> 03:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
need the guidance from the treasury
 
03:15:10.229 --> 03:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
thanks and uh we need
 
03:15:12.469 --> 03:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
the latest up-to-date information from
 
03:15:13.910 --> 03:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
03:15:16.630 --> 03:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
and we we need to talk about this
 
03:15:18.150 --> 03:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves
 
03:15:19.670 --> 03:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's a number of questions that were
 
03:15:22.630 --> 03:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
raised today and we need those answers
 
03:15:25.830 --> 03:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
and hold off on this until
 
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
we get that or until the as
 
03:15:33.830 --> 03:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
long as we can before we execute
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
i think that's essential and i
 
03:15:37.830 --> 03:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
and then uh the immediate question is
 
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh related to
 
03:15:47.670 --> 03:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
our surge in revenues and the question
 
03:15:49.750 --> 03:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
of whether
 
03:15:52.100 --> 03:15:52.110 align:start position:0%
dra knows
 
03:15:52.110 --> 03:15:53.349 align:start position:0%
dra knows
[Music]

03:15:53.349 --> 03:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
if there is if there have been
 
03:16:00.070 --> 03:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
revenues received that reflect payments
 
03:16:00.080 --> 03:16:00.830 align:start position:0%
revenues received that reflect payments
by

03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of
 
03:16:09.590 --> 03:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
on on ppp
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
loan proceeds that may lead
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
subsequently if sp3 is enacted to a
 
03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
refund request
 
03:16:23.830 --> 03:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
first question asked before lindsay
 
03:16:25.190 --> 03:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
answers that
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
let me add to that is that
 
03:16:30.229 --> 03:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
over the weekend i talked to my
 
03:16:30.239 --> 03:16:31.750 align:start position:0%
over the weekend i talked to my
accountant

03:16:31.750 --> 03:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
accountant
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
and and he reminded me that
 
03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh he's processed an awful lot of
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
returns that had to do with the ppp
 
03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:42.469 align:start position:0%
returns that had to do with the ppp
loans

03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
loans
 
03:16:44.550 --> 03:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
and they paid the taxes because they
 
03:16:46.229 --> 03:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
used current law
 
03:16:48.389 --> 03:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
he says that if senate bill 3 goes
 
03:16:49.269 --> 03:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
through as it is
 
03:16:51.269 --> 03:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to see an awful lot of
 
03:16:51.279 --> 03:16:52.950 align:start position:0%
we're going to see an awful lot of
refunds

03:16:52.950 --> 03:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
03:16:56.229 --> 03:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm anxious to hear
 
03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
what lindsay has to say is she able to
 
03:17:03.349 --> 03:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
estimate how things are going relative
 
03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
to that how much of this
 
03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
excess revenue that we've been getting
 
03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
now is associated
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
with what we may have to refund if
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3 goes through as
 
03:17:17.349 --> 03:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
is sure
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
so i think that there's
 
03:17:23.670 --> 03:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
um a couple different scenarios
 
03:17:26.710 --> 03:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
that we are seeing here
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
the first representative major as you
 
03:17:29.520 --> 03:17:30.710 align:start position:0%
the first representative major as you
mentioned

03:17:30.710 --> 03:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:17:33.910 --> 03:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
is that businesses have accounted for
 
03:17:33.920 --> 03:17:35.429 align:start position:0%
is that businesses have accounted for
ppp

03:17:35.429 --> 03:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
ppp
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
um loan forgiveness in their 2020
 
03:17:42.630 --> 03:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
tax returns if that is the case
 
03:17:44.710 --> 03:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
they have presumably done one of two
 
03:17:44.720 --> 03:17:45.830 align:start position:0%
they have presumably done one of two
things

03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:17:48.710 --> 03:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
they have filed and paid their tax
 
03:17:48.720 --> 03:17:49.269 align:start position:0%
they have filed and paid their tax
return

03:17:49.269 --> 03:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
return
 
03:17:52.389 --> 03:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
timely in either march or april
 
03:17:55.910 --> 03:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
or they have paid the amount that they
 
03:17:58.870 --> 03:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
owe but have not yet filed their return
 
03:17:59.590 --> 03:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
and they
 
03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
are taking advantage of the automatic
 
03:18:03.190 --> 03:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
seven month extension
 
03:18:05.670 --> 03:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
in order to file their return and will
 
03:18:08.469 --> 03:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
be receiving those returns in the fall
 
03:18:11.910 --> 03:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes let's talk about those two scenarios
 
03:18:13.190 --> 03:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
first so
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the first instance where they have
 
03:18:18.870 --> 03:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
filed their actual return
 
03:18:22.229 --> 03:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
there is a line on our schedule
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
4 that asks them to report the amount of
 
03:18:26.399 --> 03:18:27.590 align:start position:0%
4 that asks them to report the amount of
ppp

03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
ppp
 
03:18:31.190 --> 03:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
that was not included in gross income
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
on their federal return but is included
 
03:18:35.429 --> 03:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
in gross income
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
on their new hampshire return so we can
 
03:18:39.910 --> 03:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
start to look at those numbers
 
03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
we will need to put those amounts
 
03:18:44.790 --> 03:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
through apportionment formulas and then
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
apply the tax
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a little bit of work for us
 
03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly start
 
03:18:51.349 --> 03:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
doing that and that will start to give
 
03:18:54.790 --> 03:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
us an idea of what we've seen
 
03:18:58.870 --> 03:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
for businesses that are
 
03:19:02.309 --> 03:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
opting to file an extension we have
 
03:19:04.469 --> 03:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
presumably the amount of money that they
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
owe but we don't know
 
03:19:09.590 --> 03:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
what portion of that is related to ppp
 
03:19:11.349 --> 03:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
because they haven't filed their final
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
return yet
 
03:19:16.309 --> 03:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
the other scenario that we have is what
 
03:19:17.590 --> 03:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
former representative stringham
 
03:19:17.600 --> 03:19:18.710 align:start position:0%
former representative stringham
mentioned

03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:19:21.750 --> 03:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
where they may be waiting for the actual
 
03:19:21.760 --> 03:19:23.349 align:start position:0%
where they may be waiting for the actual
forgiveness

03:19:23.349 --> 03:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
forgiveness
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
in order to account for that in their
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
return and so that may not happen until
 
03:19:28.880 --> 03:19:30.830 align:start position:0%
return and so that may not happen until
2021.

03:19:30.830 --> 03:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
2021.
 
03:19:34.150 --> 03:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
so we can start to put some
 
03:19:36.070 --> 03:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
some guardrails and framework around
 
03:19:38.070 --> 03:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
what we've seen but we don't
 
03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
have exact answers to that question
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the more knowledge we know about
 
03:19:45.760 --> 03:19:47.269 align:start position:0%
yeah the more knowledge we know about
this

03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
we can prevent people from saying we
 
03:19:52.309 --> 03:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
have it we can spend it now
 
03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
and we've got to prevent that
 
03:19:58.630 --> 03:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
or give them the knowledge so that they
 
03:20:00.469 --> 03:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
can make the decision not to do
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
something like that certainly so we can
 
03:20:05.830 --> 03:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
start to look at those numbers for you
 
03:20:07.349 --> 03:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
um that have been reported on the
 
03:20:09.750 --> 03:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
returns and have that ready for
 
03:20:14.229 --> 03:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
um for your work session thank you uh
 
03:20:16.710 --> 03:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
represent ames
 
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry if my hand is still up it
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
03:20:26.830 --> 03:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:26.840 --> 03:20:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
on

03:20:29.990 --> 03:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:33.349 --> 03:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
i i had a question about how
 
03:20:37.030 --> 03:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh water's edge fits into this
 
03:20:42.630 --> 03:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
when uh subsidiaries and and
 
03:20:46.389 --> 03:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
on subcontractors are
 
03:20:50.229 --> 03:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
on are applying for ppp that cannot be
 
03:20:51.269 --> 03:20:51.279 align:start position:0%
applied for
 
03:20:54.630 --> 03:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
by the larger corporation
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
and um i did find it in the lebanon
 
03:20:58.800 --> 03:21:00.229 align:start position:0%
and um i did find it in the lebanon
results

03:21:00.229 --> 03:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
results
 
03:21:04.389 --> 03:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
a neighbor who um is a
 
03:21:04.399 --> 03:21:09.429 align:start position:0%
a neighbor who um is a
on

03:21:09.429 --> 03:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:12.070 --> 03:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
is a um i'm not sure what the legal
 
03:21:12.080 --> 03:21:12.950 align:start position:0%
is a um i'm not sure what the legal
relationship

03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
is but works within a
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
corporation in vermont that uh does
 
03:21:21.030 --> 03:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
drainage work
 
03:21:25.190 --> 03:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh and who uh applied for ppp on his own
 
03:21:27.150 --> 03:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire um
 
03:21:27.160 --> 03:21:28.469 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire um
[Music]

03:21:28.469 --> 03:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:21:31.750 --> 03:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not i'm not really sure how
 
03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
all of these things fit together but
 
03:21:33.920 --> 03:21:35.190 align:start position:0%
all of these things fit together but
whether

03:21:35.190 --> 03:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:21:38.229 --> 03:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
on would it make a difference
 
03:21:42.389 --> 03:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
or does your 47 account for that really
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
if on there are a large number of
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
small ppp applicants that received loans
 
03:21:51.349 --> 03:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
that became grants
 
03:21:54.630 --> 03:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
or will become grants um and
 
03:21:57.910 --> 03:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
on they are incorporated into filings
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
under water edge order's edge from the
 
03:22:03.110 --> 03:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
large taxpayers
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
sure so the the simplest way i think to
 
03:22:07.269 --> 03:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
is how they file for new hampshire tax
 
03:22:13.110 --> 03:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
purposes as a consolidated return
 
03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:13.910 align:start position:0%
purposes as a consolidated return
potentially

03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
under as a water's edge corporation
 
03:22:19.349 --> 03:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
that may not be the same as how they
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
filed for ppp
 
03:22:25.110 --> 03:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
their their two separate statutory
 
03:22:25.120 --> 03:22:26.710 align:start position:0%
their their two separate statutory
requirements

03:22:26.710 --> 03:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:22:29.830 --> 03:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
and so again how they file in new
 
03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
and so again how they file in new
hampshire

03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:22:33.750 --> 03:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
may not be the same how they lawfully
 
03:22:36.070 --> 03:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
file or correctly file in new hampshire
 
03:22:39.190 --> 03:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
may not have been how they filed for ppp
 
03:22:40.389 --> 03:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that how they
 
03:22:43.269 --> 03:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
filed for ppp was wrong
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
the the requirements for how the number
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
of employees were determined in the
 
03:22:47.760 --> 03:22:48.389 align:start position:0%
of employees were determined in the
various

03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
various
 
03:22:50.710 --> 03:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
other requirements in order to be
 
03:22:52.870 --> 03:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for ppp
 
03:22:56.150 --> 03:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
may have allowed for subsidiaries of who
 
03:22:58.389 --> 03:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
we view to be a large multinational
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
waters edge corporation
 
03:23:04.950 --> 03:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
they may have qualified under ppp
 
03:23:06.950 --> 03:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
under the law as drafted so they're
 
03:23:09.030 --> 03:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
almost apples and oranges
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
um the 47 that's a good question
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
that is based on our filings so that
 
03:23:14.880 --> 03:23:15.750 align:start position:0%
that is based on our filings so that
assumes

03:23:15.750 --> 03:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
assumes
 
03:23:18.070 --> 03:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
the water's edge consolidated return
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
filing so again there may be a
 
03:23:22.070 --> 03:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
discrepancy there between
 
03:23:24.630 --> 03:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
how they file and how they may have been
 
03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
and and i had on a request also
 
03:23:35.990 --> 03:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
that on main
 
03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
when we were asked to do the same thing
 
03:23:42.550 --> 03:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
for the main street program i was told
 
03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
yet yesterday uh by
 
03:23:49.510 --> 03:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh miss layer about on
 
03:23:52.950 --> 03:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh how much that that is on your records
 
03:23:54.630 --> 03:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
and i'd like that to be given to the
 
03:23:54.640 --> 03:23:56.229 align:start position:0%
and i'd like that to be given to the
committee

03:23:56.229 --> 03:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:23:58.229 --> 03:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
sure we can certainly provide that so
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
you you do mention a good point
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
um grants under main street and south
 
03:24:03.990 --> 03:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
and any of the other state
 
03:24:07.250 --> 03:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
programs using cares act funds um
 
03:24:07.260 --> 03:24:08.469 align:start position:0%
programs using cares act funds um
[Music]

03:24:08.469 --> 03:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:24:11.590 --> 03:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
do not have the same additional benefit
 
03:24:14.550 --> 03:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
afforded to them at the federal level
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
and then obviously not at the state
 
03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:16.550 align:start position:0%
and then obviously not at the state
level

03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:24:19.269 --> 03:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
so a main street grant for instance a
 
03:24:19.279 --> 03:24:19.910 align:start position:0%
so a main street grant for instance a
building

03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:24:21.429 --> 03:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
business that received the full the
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
maximum main street amount of 350
 
03:24:27.510 --> 03:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
000 that grant is included in taxable
 
03:24:29.030 --> 03:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
and gross income excuse me at the
 
03:24:31.110 --> 03:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
federal level and the expenses can be
 
03:24:31.120 --> 03:24:31.910 align:start position:0%
federal level and the expenses can be
deducted

03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
deducted
 
03:24:34.150 --> 03:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
which is the same as how we treat them
 
03:24:36.229 --> 03:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
at the state level as well
 
03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
but we'll get you the analysis assuming
 
03:24:40.630 --> 03:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
that sb3
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
also applied to the main street itself
 
03:24:43.920 --> 03:24:44.630 align:start position:0%
also applied to the main street itself
brands

03:24:44.630 --> 03:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
brands
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
right and that would be true
 
03:24:49.830 --> 03:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
as long as congress doesn't say it
 
03:24:52.070 --> 03:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the rules and make these
 
03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
other things very
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
act that is correct under
 
03:24:59.110 --> 03:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
current law as of today right
 
03:25:01.670 --> 03:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury
 
03:25:04.550 --> 03:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um you
 
03:25:07.830 --> 03:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh earlier lindsay that
 
03:25:10.309 --> 03:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
naturally this affects all businesses
 
03:25:10.319 --> 03:25:10.950 align:start position:0%
naturally this affects all businesses
subject

03:25:10.950 --> 03:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
subject
 
03:25:13.269 --> 03:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
to our business tax regardless of
 
03:25:14.710 --> 03:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
whether they're domiciled in
 
03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so do we have any sense
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
of how that breaks out proportionally
 
03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
how much of
 
03:25:25.590 --> 03:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
this would effectively benefit
 
03:25:29.349 --> 03:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:32.790 --> 03:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
not specifically because again i can't
 
03:25:37.429 --> 03:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
tie the data to our individual records
 
03:25:39.750 --> 03:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
so without the identification numbers i
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
can't look to a specific business's
 
03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:43.190 align:start position:0%
can't look to a specific business's
apportionment

03:25:43.190 --> 03:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
to know how exactly
 
03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
they would in it would impact new
 
03:25:51.750 --> 03:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses
 
03:25:53.830 --> 03:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
i suppose that's probably the answer you
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
were going to give but
 
03:25:58.710 --> 03:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
in light of that is it probable that
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's a significant percentage
 
03:26:05.030 --> 03:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
i would say as a whole the majority of
 
03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
our revenues
 
03:26:08.469 --> 03:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
obviously come from businesses that are
 
03:26:10.710 --> 03:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
not domiciled here in new hampshire
 
03:26:13.910 --> 03:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know we have one state and one
 
03:26:13.920 --> 03:26:14.309 align:start position:0%
you know we have one state and one
business

03:26:14.309 --> 03:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:26:16.150 --> 03:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
one state's worth of businesses and we
 
03:26:18.389 --> 03:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
have 50 states worth of businesses that
 
03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
conducting business here um
 
03:26:25.910 --> 03:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
where that analysis gets tricky is when
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
you start to consider
 
03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
as representative omni was alluded
 
03:26:31.670 --> 03:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
alluding to obviously the largest
 
03:26:33.110 --> 03:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
portion of our revenues
 
03:26:34.870 --> 03:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
come from large multinational
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
organizations that are unlikely to
 
03:26:41.670 --> 03:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
have been able to get ppp
 
03:26:43.590 --> 03:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
and so when you start taking those out
 
03:26:45.269 --> 03:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
of the equation
 
03:26:48.150 --> 03:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
i don't have a good handle on how that
 
03:26:48.160 --> 03:26:48.870 align:start position:0%
i don't have a good handle on how that
likely

03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
likely
 
03:26:51.429 --> 03:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
impacts the new hampshire portion of
 
03:26:52.950 --> 03:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
businesses to the total portion of
 
03:26:52.960 --> 03:26:53.670 align:start position:0%
businesses to the total portion of
businesses

03:26:53.670 --> 03:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
03:26:56.469 --> 03:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
obviously it starts to dilute it um and
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
again just based on
 
03:27:00.790 --> 03:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
the 0.4 percent apportionment that we
 
03:27:01.750 --> 03:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
typically use
 
03:27:04.389 --> 03:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
and again that's based on population um
 
03:27:05.590 --> 03:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
03:27:08.630 --> 03:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
the majority of businesses that would
 
03:27:10.150 --> 03:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
benefit from this
 
03:27:12.070 --> 03:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
um would be businesses that are not
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
domiciled in new hampshire
 
03:27:14.710 --> 03:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
but obviously businesses that are
 
03:27:15.990 --> 03:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
dominant styled in new hampshire would
 
03:27:19.349 --> 03:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:22.790 --> 03:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up if i may follow up
 
03:27:25.750 --> 03:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah purely hypothetical so i i only
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
want to sort of refer to this
 
03:27:30.229 --> 03:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
but if we were in the single sales
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
factor stage already
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
that would make it even more complicated
 
03:27:37.030 --> 03:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
and undeterminable wouldn't it
 
03:27:41.110 --> 03:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
it would most likely because um
 
03:27:43.429 --> 03:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
sales well one we would have to be a
 
03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
couple years in or at least a full year
 
03:27:47.670 --> 03:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
into single sales factors so that we
 
03:27:50.229 --> 03:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
would have that data off of our returns
 
03:27:53.830 --> 03:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
um and then also one of the things with
 
03:27:56.309 --> 03:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
single sales factor is it is the most
 
03:27:58.309 --> 03:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
volatile factor when it comes to
 
03:27:58.319 --> 03:27:59.349 align:start position:0%
volatile factor when it comes to
apportionment

03:27:59.349 --> 03:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
obviously your sales in any given state
 
03:28:04.070 --> 03:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
can change pretty easily from year to
 
03:28:04.080 --> 03:28:04.630 align:start position:0%
can change pretty easily from year to
year

03:28:04.630 --> 03:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:28:06.790 --> 03:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
a good marketing campaign in texas could
 
03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
really you know drive up your sales in
 
03:28:08.640 --> 03:28:09.510 align:start position:0%
really you know drive up your sales in
texas

03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
texas
 
03:28:11.590 --> 03:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
where property and payroll are factors
 
03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
that tend to be more stable over time
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
um so yes if we were in single sales
 
03:28:21.269 --> 03:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
especially during a pandemic the data
 
03:28:22.070 --> 03:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
a little more volatile and would make
 
03:28:25.990 --> 03:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
our analysis potentially more difficult
 
03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
you're confirming exactly what i
 
03:28:27.520 --> 03:28:30.710 align:start position:0%
you're confirming exactly what i
suspected

03:28:30.710 --> 03:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh further questions of lindsay do you
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
have anything else to add lindsey
 
03:28:38.070 --> 03:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
i do not we will get you the follow-up
 
03:28:40.710 --> 03:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
information which i have in my notes as
 
03:28:43.429 --> 03:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
the bulleted overview of the difference
 
03:28:44.870 --> 03:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
between the state and federal treatment
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
that i went over at the beginning
 
03:28:49.190 --> 03:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
we will put the full amount of potential
 
03:28:50.309 --> 03:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
ppp to be
 
03:28:53.670 --> 03:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
issued through our analysis to give you
 
03:28:56.229 --> 03:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
an updated fiscal note taking that into
 
03:28:56.239 --> 03:28:57.190 align:start position:0%
an updated fiscal note taking that into
account

03:28:57.190 --> 03:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
account
 
03:28:58.950 --> 03:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
we will start to analyze the numbers
 
03:29:00.630 --> 03:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
that we've received on the schedule
 
03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
4 for returns we've received to date
 
03:29:04.630 --> 03:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
that report ppp amounts
 
03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll also calculate the impact if
 
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3
 
03:29:11.750 --> 03:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
was expanded to include the
 
03:29:14.070 --> 03:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
state level main street and south
 
03:29:14.080 --> 03:29:15.670 align:start position:0%
state level main street and south
programs

03:29:15.670 --> 03:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
and then thank you again lindsay
 
03:29:28.950 --> 03:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:33.990 --> 03:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else janine
 
03:29:38.070 --> 03:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
no there's not um
 
03:29:42.309 --> 03:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
no all right does anybody else wish to
 
03:29:45.670 --> 03:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
comment or have questions or contribute
 
03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
to the public hearing on senate bill 3.
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
if not i'm going to close the public
 
03:29:54.150 --> 03:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
hearing on senate bill 3
 
03:29:55.990 --> 03:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
and i would anticipate we would be
 
03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
having at least a couple of work
 
03:29:57.840 --> 03:29:58.870 align:start position:0%
having at least a couple of work
sessions

03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 3. and i
 
03:30:06.150 --> 03:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
i would also encourage
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
the members to throw
 
03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
the information that they have
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
especially the information
 
03:30:19.190 --> 03:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:21.750 --> 03:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
other states now what percentage of
 
03:30:23.750 --> 03:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
their revenues come from
 
03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
say income tax sales tax
 
03:30:31.670 --> 03:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
corporate tax and all that because
 
03:30:33.750 --> 03:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
when you start making decisions on what
 
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
other states do
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
you gotta analyze
 
03:30:40.950 --> 03:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
how is that going to affect new
 
03:30:43.590 --> 03:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire new hampshire
 
03:30:46.229 --> 03:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
is different than all the other states
 
03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the only state
 
03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
without a broad-based sales tax and a
 
03:30:51.359 --> 03:30:52.150 align:start position:0%
without a broad-based sales tax and a
broad-based

03:30:52.150 --> 03:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
broad-based
 
03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
income tax therefore new hampshire
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
cannot recover
 
03:31:01.349 --> 03:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
any additional funds due to ppp loans
 
03:31:03.190 --> 03:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
these other states with an income tax
 
03:31:04.710 --> 03:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
and sales tax
 
03:31:07.750 --> 03:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
if they do not tax
 
03:31:11.670 --> 03:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
the ppp loans still get the benefit
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the tax on wages
 
03:31:21.269 --> 03:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
and the sales tax on goods and services
 
03:31:24.229 --> 03:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
so you've got to remember all these
 
03:31:26.710 --> 03:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
things they all tie together
 
03:31:28.710 --> 03:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
so anybody else have anything else they
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
want to contribute
 
03:31:33.110 --> 03:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
if not um we will
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
go right our next bill which i think
 
03:31:40.229 --> 03:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
will be very short
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
which is senate bill 112.
 
03:31:56.469 --> 03:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
i would take a break but i don't think
 
03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
this is going to last
 
03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
oh wow wait a minute um
 
03:32:04.150 --> 03:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
but it's only fair to ask you do you
 
03:32:06.229 --> 03:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
want to take a break and come back in 30
 
03:32:06.239 --> 03:32:07.510 align:start position:0%
want to take a break and come back in 30
minutes

03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:32:10.469 --> 03:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
or do you want to plow through this no i
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to take a second
 
03:32:15.670 --> 03:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
plow through follow through okay
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:21.590 --> 03:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
this is a public hearing on senate bill
 
03:32:22.950 --> 03:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
112 and act
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
relative to historic racing and
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
we did a side-by-side comparison on this
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
bill compared to senate bill
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh 2 626 and then
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's essentially no difference except
 
03:32:39.750 --> 03:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
a few
 
03:32:42.870 --> 03:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
minor word changes which
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the intent of the bill
 
03:32:52.150 --> 03:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
so essentially senate bill 12 appears
 
03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill 12 is the same thing as
 
03:33:00.309 --> 03:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
as house bill 626 which passed our
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee in the senate last week five
 
03:33:02.960 --> 03:33:04.550 align:start position:0%
committee in the senate last week five
to

03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
five to zero and it's going to be on the
 
03:33:07.910 --> 03:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
03:33:11.429 --> 03:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
in the senate we have
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:20.950 --> 03:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh and they're all in support uh
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the first is opposing
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:32.790 --> 03:33:32.800 align:start position:0%

my name is grant bosse i'm the majority
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
policy director

for the new hampshire senate here today
 
03:34:01.590 --> 03:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
on behalf of senator french the prime
 
03:34:03.830 --> 03:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor of senate bill 112 he is not
 
03:34:03.840 --> 03:34:04.710 align:start position:0%
sponsor of senate bill 112 he is not
available

03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:34:06.550 --> 03:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
and asked me to introduce the bill he
 
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
thanks you for your courtesy
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 112 would establish
 
03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
paramutual pools for historic house
 
03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
racing the senate approved it with a
 
03:34:17.190 --> 03:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
strong vote of 20-4
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
and as the chairman said the issue is
 
03:34:20.469 --> 03:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
quite familiar to you
 
03:34:22.870 --> 03:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
having approved a nearly identical bill
 
03:34:23.590 --> 03:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
03:34:26.309 --> 03:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
626 just last month that bill is
 
03:34:28.150 --> 03:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be heard by the full senate
 
03:34:30.550 --> 03:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
on thursday so it could be on its way to
 
03:34:31.750 --> 03:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
03:34:33.990 --> 03:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
before you get around to this bill
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
historic racing pools would provide
 
03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:36.070 align:start position:0%
historic racing pools would provide
another

03:34:36.070 --> 03:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:34:37.990 --> 03:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
option for the licensed game operators
 
03:34:39.830 --> 03:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
currently working in new hampshire
 
03:34:42.309 --> 03:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
and would generate an estimated 12.2
 
03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
annually for the education trust fund as
 
03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
well as six million dollars a year for
 
03:34:49.030 --> 03:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
local charities
 
03:34:51.190 --> 03:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
i defer on the subject matter experts on
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
the details of the bill senator french
 
03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
thanks you for your consideration
 
03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
and ask for your support for senate bill
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
112. thank you very much
 
03:35:03.030 --> 03:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
and do you take questions uh i could um
 
03:35:04.469 --> 03:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
but i'd likely have to
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
take down the question and take it to
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
senator french and he'd give an answer
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
back to you
 
03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
the next if i take him in order of the
 
03:35:18.550 --> 03:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
sign up
 
03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
is a michael remy from keene new
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%

03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
opposing representative
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
remy is representative remy
 
03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
hello i'm uh mr chair thank you uh
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
all for having me i'm actually a city
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
councilor in the city of keene
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
um i'm not particularly opposed or
 
03:35:50.229 --> 03:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
in favor of the language itself for the
 
03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
bill i think that this
 
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
i mean it's up to the group as far as uh
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
what the the right decision is here but
 
03:35:57.910 --> 03:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
what i am a little bit
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh disappointed in is that the current
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
date that's chosen
 
03:36:06.070 --> 03:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
excludes one uh license holder
 
03:36:07.990 --> 03:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that one license holder happens to
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
be in the city of keene
 
03:36:10.630 --> 03:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
and i find that that's a little bit
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
disappointing that
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
there was a floor amendment to this bill
 
03:36:16.229 --> 03:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
that was proposed
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
by senator khan that was uh
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
was declined that would adjust the date
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
to december 31st
 
03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
of 2020 instead of may um and that would
 
03:36:27.750 --> 03:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
have included this last license holder
 
03:36:27.760 --> 03:36:28.070 align:start position:0%
have included this last license holder
who

03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
opened the business during kovid and now
 
03:36:32.469 --> 03:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
we're excluding them for some reason
 
03:36:34.469 --> 03:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
from being able to participate in this
 
03:36:34.479 --> 03:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
from being able to participate in this
uh

03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:39.510 --> 03:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
this opportunity so while i'm not a
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor or opposed to the bill
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
itself i do find it disappointing that
 
03:36:45.590 --> 03:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
we would exclude one person from this
 
03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i said the same thing before the
 
03:36:50.229 --> 03:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
senate when they were reviewing 626.
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your testimony to
 
03:36:53.990 --> 03:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
03:36:55.830 --> 03:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
if i i'm not sure what i can answer but
 
03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
i would happy to take any questions
 
03:36:58.080 --> 03:36:59.269 align:start position:0%
i would happy to take any questions

03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
representing earlier yeah after trying
 
03:37:14.830 --> 03:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
to find it
 
03:37:18.150 --> 03:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
sleeping turn off button uh if this
 
03:37:20.630 --> 03:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
is uh this is a question of the chair
 
03:37:20.640 --> 03:37:21.590 align:start position:0%
is uh this is a question of the chair
sir

03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
sir
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
if this bill is identical to the other
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
bill would it not be appropriate for us
 
03:37:26.950 --> 03:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
to do essentially nothing because
 
03:37:34.389 --> 03:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
the other bill is already
 
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
past the senate that is up to the
 
03:37:36.800 --> 03:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
past the senate that is up to the
committee

03:37:39.910 --> 03:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:39.920 --> 03:37:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:45.990 --> 03:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr schoenberg uh i guess this

03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
have to be testimony because
 
03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
i'm a co-sponsor on uh senate bill 112
 
03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
03:40:12.389 --> 03:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
so representative rami uh rockham 19.
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
so uh i did have conversation
 
03:40:19.030 --> 03:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
with both uh senator guida as well as
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
senator french
 
03:40:23.670 --> 03:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
and uh they're all in agreement that
 
03:40:23.680 --> 03:40:24.950 align:start position:0%
and uh they're all in agreement that
that

03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
that senator house bill 626 be the
 
03:40:27.600 --> 03:40:28.870 align:start position:0%
that senator house bill 626 be the
vehicle

03:40:28.870 --> 03:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
and that they have no problem that uh if
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
we retain this or whatever we decide to
 
03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:34.950 align:start position:0%
we retain this or whatever we decide to
do

03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh because the other bill is is already
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
on the way
 
03:40:40.550 --> 03:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's on consent calendar in
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
so um so it's
 
03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
all but i think passed so
 
03:40:51.030 --> 03:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
um i see uh grant
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
grant has his hand up i could i could
 
03:40:55.349 --> 03:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
address that it is on the consent
 
03:40:57.830 --> 03:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
calendar there were two floor amendments
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
one to change the date and address that
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
keen operator that was defeated on the
 
03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
senate floor
 
03:41:06.550 --> 03:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
the first time and on this bill
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the second was a local option
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
essentially allowing the municipality to
 
03:41:12.389 --> 03:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
decide whether
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
these would be allowed that was also
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
defeated by the full senate
 
03:41:18.070 --> 03:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
um it is on the consent calendar it may
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
be taken off the consent calendar but it
 
03:41:22.229 --> 03:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
got a 20-4 vote i would anticipate
 
03:41:23.910 --> 03:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
passage and heading into the governor's
 
03:41:23.920 --> 03:41:24.710 align:start position:0%
passage and heading into the governor's
desk

03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
desk
 
03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
that would leave you in possession of a
 
03:41:28.469 --> 03:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
senate bill um
 
03:41:33.510 --> 03:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:36.870 --> 03:41:36.880 align:start position:0%

03:41:47.830 --> 03:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
