foreign

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
they gave me all right they gave me the
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
small chair I get it
 
00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
it's all funny
 
00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:57.589 align:start position:0%
it's all funny
um

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
well thanks everyone for joining us I I
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
think we're just having a discussion I
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't know if uh additional designees
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
from the legislature have been uh
 
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
designated yet um so I'm not sure if
 
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
someone from the senate or house finance
 
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 align:start position:0%
will be joining us but uh we will get
 
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
started here
 
00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 align:start position:0%
um I just want to kick it off with a few
 
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
kind of opening statements and just so
 
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
folks kind of understand where I've
 
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
envisioned the budget process moving
 
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.190 align:start position:0%
envisioned the budget process moving
forward

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.790 align:start position:0%
forward
um

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of opportunity on
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
the table to be sure but we also have to
 
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
be cautious with
 
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
um where the economy as a whole could be
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
going and therefore what some of the
 
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
variables that we'll have to consider as
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
we move forward in in the budget process
 
00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 align:start position:0%
and again this is a budget that
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
effectively begins in July of 23 and
 
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
will run for the subsequent two years
 
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
following so we it really has to be a
 
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
budget that puts a lot of forethought
 
00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
into where not just where we are today
 
00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
but uh the very different aspect of
 
00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 align:start position:0%
where we're likely to be uh in the
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
coming years
 
00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
um so we are in a very strong position
 
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
financially there's no doubt about that
 
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
I think we've managed our finances here
 
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
very very well over the past couple of
 
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
years in the past couple of years have
 
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
been very tumultuous in a variety of
 
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
ways both nationally
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
um uh and uh here within New Hampshire
 
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh but I think we've managed our
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
programs very well we've managed a very
 
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
tight budget with uh the 2122 budget
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
cycle uh that we're currently in making
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
sure that the programs that we have are
 
00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 align:start position:0%
fully funded making sure that the
 
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities that we want to that we we
 
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
can provide our citizens and that our
 
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
citizens are depending on are really
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
there for them so I think we've had a
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
lot of success in in that Arena on the
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
economic front locally again we're in a
 
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
very good position in that we are the
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
fastest growing state in New England
 
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
businesses want to be here families are
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
moving in those are all very very
 
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
positive uh economic variables that we
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
really key into
 
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
and that can provide a lot of
 
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity in in what will I think be
 
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly some more economically
 
00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
unsure times uh for the nation as a
 
00:04:58.979 --> 00:04:59.990 align:start position:0%
unsure times uh for the nation as a
whole

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 align:start position:0%
um some of the challenges that we're
 
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
looking at really revolve around
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce right it's all about Workforce
 
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
now uh whether you're looking at New
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or across the country and
 
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
Workforce is especially important not
 
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
just in the private sector but as it
 
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
pertains to the budget within the state
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and so again we can
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
have the it's not about the dollars and
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
cents as much as it is about making sure
 
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
that we have the teams and the
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
individuals to fulfill on the commitment
 
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
of the programs uh that that we do want
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
to implement and we want to continue
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
implementing we've tried a lot of new
 
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
programs here in New Hampshire over the
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
past couple years and some of them have
 
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
been extremely successful
 
00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 align:start position:0%
um everything from you know embracing
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
the a new model with uh how we treat
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
opioids the huge Investments we've
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
recently made in mental health uh the
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
Investments and the changes we've we've
 
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
implemented at dcyf making sure that
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
child welfare is is really at a foremost
 
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
um uh position in terms of our
 
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
priorities but at the end of the day all
 
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
of these opportunities don't really
 
00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
exist for the citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the staff if you don't
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
have the people some of the the more
 
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
macro economic challenges that will have
 
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
to be brought into consideration with
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
this budget
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
is just looking at everything from
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
inflation inflationary costs and whether
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
they be on the capital side and the
 
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
capital budget uh interest rates which
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
continue to rise and likely will
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
continue to rise and unfortunately with
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
the extreme rise in those interest rates
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
there's really no way to avoid some form
 
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
of a national recession it is real it is
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
coming my guess is and this is just my
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
guess and we can all have our debate I'm
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
going to look at Lindsay
 
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
um uh in the audience and Charlie and
 
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
and James the the smart economic people
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
the real brains of the operation so to
 
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
say uh to tell me where I'm wrong but my
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
sense is you're we're going to start
 
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
really feeling a pinch of a recession
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere in 23 into 24.
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
um there's you just cannot have
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
inflation like this in interest rates
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
Rising like this uh the math just works
 
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 align:start position:0%
out that a resection is is unfortunately
 
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
very very real but again given in the
 
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
Northeast that we are the state right
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
now that is uh the most desirable place
 
00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
to come to and businesses want to be
 
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
here and we have I think Far and Away
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
the most growth opportunity of of any
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
state in the Northeast that does give us
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
an upper hand on a lot of these
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
impending and more negative variables
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
that you'll see macro macro economically
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
just also on the capital side of things
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
to note with those Rising interest rates
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
the reality of borrowing money becomes a
 
00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 align:start position:0%
much more difficult proposition we can
 
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
borrow money and we get great rates when
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
we borrow money but those rates no
 
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
longer really exist when we were
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
investing in a lot of our capital
 
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
projects on the capital budget side uh
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
just a few years ago interest rates were
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
at historically low levels it made a lot
 
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
of sense to borrow the you know 125
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars or whatever our budget
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
was granting us for those capital
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
projects and move forward I think that
 
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to be extremely
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
careful I will be proposing a capital
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
budget much much smaller than anything
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
that we've we've proposed before for a
 
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
couple reasons number one the federal
 
00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
government has granted us a lot of money
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
for one-time Capital Investments through
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
arpa and some of these other the
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
infrastructure programs with everything
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
from broadband and you know fixing up
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
our buildings I mean there's a little
 
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
bit of everything in there parks we're
 
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
doing more capital investment in the
 
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire today
 
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
Far and Away than we've ever done before
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
and that that is a huge gift if you will
 
00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
from the federal government in terms of
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
the dollar so one-time money I think
 
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
we're spending it very wisely but what
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
it also means is do we really have to go
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
forward with a full Capital 125 million
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
dollar Capital plan knowing that to do
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
that would have to borrow money right
 
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.190 align:start position:0%
that would have to borrow money right
now

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
um quasi-historically High interest
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
rates well that might not be the
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
smartest thing either also understanding
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
that the inflationary costs of all these
 
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:49.019 align:start position:0%
projects are absolutely huge so I think
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
those bigger negative variables on the
 
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
capital budget will have to be taken
 
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
into very serious consideration
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
when we look at not just how much we're
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
going to spend or where the dollars are
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to be but the timing timing plays
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
a lot into the opportunities that you
 
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
have and we've been given a lot of
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
opportunities we're moving forward on a
 
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
lot of these capital projects but in
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
terms of how the state borrows money and
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
our responsibility to the taxpayer and
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
not over borrowing and overborrowing it
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
at a exorbitant rates I think that
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
definitely has to be it has to be
 
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have a couple of
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
presentations here this morning I think
 
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Revenue first
 
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
from commissioner stepp and then from uh
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
attorney general formella from the
 
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
attorney in the Department of Justice I
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
will say this overall My Philosophy in
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
in the budget process overall and I'll
 
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
be sorry just to be clear I'll be
 
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
submitting the budget around Valentine's
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
Day is is that is that right is it on
 
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day I always have that in my
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
head that it's Valentine's Day so I know
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's on or about Valentine's Day I think
 
00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
the final date will actually be to be
 
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
determined with the legislature
 
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
um once they uh for the led the new
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
legislature forms up in early December
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
so around Valentine's Day we will uh
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
present the the full budget
 
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
we've obviously been working uh James
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
Gary and uh my as my budget director has
 
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
been working diligently with all the
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
different departments uh on what their
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
needs assessments are
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
um where they are in Staffing but I'll
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
say this overall without kind of giving
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
away too many of the details because
 
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
we're still a few months away this is
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
going to be a budget probably more than
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
ever before where it's people over
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
programs because I I go back to that
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce issue it has to be about
 
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
Workforce it has to be about our state
 
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
employees we have some great programs
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
and we've been very Innovative with new
 
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
programs in the state and that doesn't
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
mean we're not going to keep trying new
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
things of course but again if we don't
 
00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:40.019 align:start position:0%
really Shore up where where we are and
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
what our staffing levels are going to be
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
and making sure that at the end of the
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
day we have the individuals to deliver
 
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
these Services none of the other
 
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
programs the program doesn't matter
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
right and unless you have the the people
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
in the drive behind it and so I think
 
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
overall that is a good
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
um umbrella philosophy that you'll see
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
at least out of out of my office and
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully the legislature will share
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
that that our priority really needs to
 
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
be about a lot of the individuals our
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
making sure not just that we retain them
 
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
but we create opportunities for them and
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
understand that we are competing with a
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
unprecedentedly expensive private Market
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh for for labor right now and there's a
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons for that that's
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
nothing we have to debate right now but
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
there's a whole variety of reasons why
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
the entire uh private Market is is uh
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
really tight with Staffing
 
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
um and and that's from teachers to
 
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
nurses to folks that work in restaurants
 
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
in the hardware store to folks that
 
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
deliver quality child welfare services
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
and opioid Recovery Services and all of
 
00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:41.579 align:start position:0%
these really uh programs I've been that
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
I would consider prioritized and
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
necessary at the state level
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
so with that uh I guess I guess we can
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
what that would not this is where I go
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
and ask James what I missed any of the
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
key points that I missed there you hit
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
them all sir okay great at this time I'd
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
like to invite the Department of Revenue
 
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
good morning Lindsey stepp commissioner
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me the
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity this morning to present the
 
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 and fiscal 25 operating budget
 
00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:23.579 align:start position:0%
request from the dra with me today our
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Ora Lemire and
 
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
business administrator Shelly garlano
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
the mission of the dra is to fairly and
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
efficiently administer the tax laws of
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire collecting
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
the proper amount of taxes due incurring
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
the least cost of taxpayers in a manner
 
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
that merits the highest degree of public
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
competence in our integrity
 
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
further we provide prompt and
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
constructive assistance to Municipal
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
units of government in matters of Budget
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
Finance and the appraisal of Real Estate
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
together we developed a thoughtful
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
operating budget that will provide the
 
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
resources for our team to administer the
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
tax laws of our state for another two
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal years in a manner consistent with
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
this Mission we also worked hard to
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
produce a budget that is consistent with
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
the targets that were provided
 
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 the dra collected 2.7
 
00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:13.139 align:start position:0%
billion in state revenue with operating
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
expenses of less than 18.7 million
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
some of which
 
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
um of those operating expenses are for
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
activities unrelated to revenue
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
collection such as local assessment
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
review and state aid when those
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
unrelated costs are accounted for our
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
cost of collection is just over one half
 
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
of one percent
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
the slides included with this testimony
 
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
explain how we were able to build a
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
biennial budget that continues to be an
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
unparalleled return on state tax dollar
 
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
investment we look forward to working
 
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
with you governor and members of the
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
mission statement which I already went
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%

multinational companies think Fortune
 
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
500 and the like
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
our Discovery Bureau which uses federal
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
tax information that we receive from the
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
IRS to identify new taxpayers that when
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
they come into the state
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
and our tobacco unit which ensures our

00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide four the big picture
 
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
of our fiscal 2425 budget
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
we have fiscal 23 adjusted authorized
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
total for all funds of just over 22
 
00:15:53.889 --> 00:15:53.899 align:start position:0%
million our 24 efficiency request is
 
00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:57.860 align:start position:0%
22.6 million and our fiscal 25 is
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
22.9 almost 23 million
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
the budget is approximately 90 General
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
funds the education trust fund uh
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
expenditures that you see there are for
 
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
the low and moderate property tax relief
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
program which we administer and the
 
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
agency income is related to flood
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
control for the Merrimack River Valley
 
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
and the Connecticut River Valley
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
both years are consistent with the
 
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
targets as I mentioned that were
 
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.530 align:start position:0%
targets as I mentioned that were
provided

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide five just highlights
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
of our 2425 budget current position
 
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
count is maintained at 156 full-time
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
classified and unclassified positions
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
including an additional four part-time
 
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.370 align:start position:0%
including an additional four part-time
positions

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
our efficiency budget request does fund
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
six full-time positions that are
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
unfunded in our current budget two of
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
those positions are Revenue generating
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
and with each produce an estimated 1.5
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars over the biennium so
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
those are two multi-state tax Auditors
 
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
they obviously generate Revenue those
 
00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:01.019 align:start position:0%
positions are currently unfunded if they
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
were funded we would anticipate about a
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
three million dollar increase in
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
revenues from those positions
 
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
our general fund operating budget is 75
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
of 75 salary and benefits we are a
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
department of people not things or
 
00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:18.049 align:start position:0%
department of people not things or
programs

00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:20.339 align:start position:0%
our budget request includes sufficient
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
funding for employee training
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
out-of-state travel for audits overtime
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
for Peak periods and taxpayer services
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
and collections
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining a fleet of state-owned cars
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
for our in-state Audits and property
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
appraisal work and also a sufficient
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
postage for Dra Communications to
 
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.990 align:start position:0%
postage for Dra Communications to
taxpayers

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
there are no budget increases for
 
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
one-time State Workforce efficiency
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
enhancement programs or Suite projects
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
we did receive funding for three
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
projects we are using one-time money for
 
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
one-time expenses so there's no increase
 
00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:54.299 align:start position:0%
in our operating budget related to the
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
Sweet money that we received
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
division directors business office and
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
other managers worked hard to budget
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
conservatively and accurately requesting
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
on Page Six
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
so the Dre's efficiency budget as
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
submitted maintains all current
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
operations however there are certain
 
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
areas where dra has requested additional
 
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
funding in the form of prioritized needs
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
the first is for low and moderate income
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
hardship grants so chapter 95 laws of
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
2021 increase the income limitations and
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount of relief available
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the low and moderate program
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
so the change was effective for April
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
1st 2021 property tax year and there
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
were 500 and
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
5912 claims issued for about 1.4 million
 
00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:48.860 align:start position:0%
dollars and that's compared to
 
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
5572 claims totaling 800 000 for the
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
prior year so we've seen almost doubling
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
the prioritized need of seven hundred
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is to bring the
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the 1.5 million which
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
is what we expect to spend out of the
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
program going forward
 
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23 the difference between
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
the appropriation of eight hundred
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and the actual expense
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
of close to 1.4 or 1.5 million will be
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
covered pursuant to RSA 198 colon 61
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
where the governor is authorized to draw
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
a warrant from the education trust fund
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
to satisf to satisfy the state's low and
 
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
moderate obligation so we'll draw a
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
warrant for this year but the
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
prioritized need is looking to have the
 
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.190 align:start position:0%
prioritized need is looking to have the
appropriate

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
moving on to page seven
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
we also have additional prioritized
 
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
needs related to our Revenue information
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
management system or rims just as a
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
reminder rims was a 30 million one
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty thousand dollar
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
Capital appropriation that included
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
hardware and software maintenance
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
um or sorry software licensing through
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 but it only included software
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
maintenance and Consulting through the
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
first quarter of fiscal 2024. so our
 
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
request includes maintaining our current
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
levels of software maintenance and
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
Consulting through fiscal 25 so that's
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
about 2 million dollars and 24 and 3.6
 
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539 align:start position:0%
million dollars in 25.
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
and this also includes funding for two
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
doit positions that are embedded at dra
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
that are currently unfunded
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
there's really two reasons for these
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
positions one is to prepare for about 40
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
to 60 percent of our current embedded
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
doit staff will be eligible for
 
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
retirement during the next biennium and
 
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
so we're looking to add additional
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
positions higher employees so we can do
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
some knowledge transfer and make sure we
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of knowledge walking
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
out the door with those retirements and
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
also those new positions would learn
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
from our rims Consultants to continue to
 
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
take on more of the rims maintenance
 
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.850 align:start position:0%
take on more of the rims maintenance
responsibilities

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
a portion of this request will also help
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
us prepare for the version upgrade of
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
rooms to core 21 and the funding for
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
that upgraded upgrade was uh received
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
through the suite program
 
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
I would just note that the reason why
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
we're now looking to kind of
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
operationalize these expenses that had
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
been covered in the capital budget is we
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
when we went out to bid for this work
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
and procured this work we opted to not
 
00:21:26.289 --> 00:21:26.299 align:start position:0%
select predetermined levels of support
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
ongoing for rims because we really
 
00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
didn't know what we were going to need
 
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to overbuy or under buy
 
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
so we have moved into a time and
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
materials model where we're getting just
 
00:21:38.649 --> 00:21:38.659 align:start position:0%
the right amount of support that we need
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
and that gives us some flexibility again
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we didn't sign on for
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
support that was more than what we were
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to need or that we were left
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
short-handed in terms of support so
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
that's how we're kind of transitioning
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
from the capital appropriation into the
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
operationalizing of these costs through
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
on to page eight we have
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
um one other very small prioritized need
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
of three thousand dollars which comes
 
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
through the department of administrative
 
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.630 align:start position:0%
through the department of administrative
services

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
um in the budget that we submitted in
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
our efficiency budget there were two
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs and those
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
were funded by The Sweep program so one
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
was in fiscal 24 of 400 000 for a
 
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
high-speed scanner which is what we use
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
to process the tax returns and they come
 
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
into the building
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
um that will replace our current it5
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
scanner which is at end of life and so
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
we will be discontinuing that bringing
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
in a new scanner so we will be made
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
still maintaining two scanners so
 
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
they'll always have continuity of
 
00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
operations so we haven't currently have
 
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
an it5 and an it6 the it5 will go away
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
we'll bring in the brand new scanner and
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
maintain the it6 so we can run both at
 
00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
also in fiscal 24 there was a 400 000
 
00:23:00.659 --> 00:23:02.450 align:start position:0%
also in fiscal 24 there was a 400 000
upgrade

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
um an enhancement to our 11 year old
 
00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:06.539 align:start position:0%
property Equalization web application to
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
the latest version and to include some
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
enhanced functionality again to help us
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
maintain continuity of operations within
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
staff in that division those two
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs are no longer needed
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
so they're included but they can be
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
removed because they were funded via
 
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.169 align:start position:0%
removed because they were funded via
Suite

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
and lastly I just wanted to provide an
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
update of how the Department's doing in
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
its current two-year budget the fiscal
 
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
2223 our budget priorities
 
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
first related to rims the final rollout
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
went live on August 9th of 2021 with the
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
remaining tax types we really have
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
realized many benefits related to The
 
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
Rim system over the past year the
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
efficiency of the system has allowed the
 
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
dra to continue timely processing of
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
documents received even with a vacancy
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
rate close to 15 percent
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
we also saw Revenue uplift as part of
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
the Rams project
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
so Revenue increases from existing taxes
 
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
attributable to the Implement
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
implementation of rims reached the cap
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
of 4 million dollars in fiscal 22 we can
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
transfer up to four million dollars into
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
our rims Revenue uplift account every
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
year to help pay for the bonds that were
 
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
used to purchase the system reminder to
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
pay letters just a simple letter that
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
reminds you that you have a bill due to
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
the dra that generated 2.3 million
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
dollars and use enhanced use of federal
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
tax information again the information
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we receive from the IRS that we can
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
use to help identify non-compliant
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that generated 1.7 million
 
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.870 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that generated 1.7 million
dollars

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
also customer service remains a priority
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
of the dra in fiscal 22 and fiscal 23 to
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
date we have maintained a rating of
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
three or higher on a scale of one to
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
five from 98 of our customer
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
satisfaction surveys the callers receive
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of the call into our call
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
center they have the opportunity to rate
 
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
the knowledge and the effectiveness of
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
the person that they spoke with they can
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
also leave a comment
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and some of those comments are very
 
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.149 align:start position:0%
um and some of those comments are very
uh

00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
entertaining to to listen to there's a
 
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
lot of Praise of oh dra in New Hampshire
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
answers the phone I don't get that in a
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
lot of other states I don't get that
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
when I call into the IRS I really
 
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
appreciate being able to speak with a
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
live person
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
so customer satisfaction uh Still
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
Remains high and included with rims was
 
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
the launch of granite tax connect which
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
is the online portal which allows
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and practitioners to access
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
their accounts online make payments file
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
documents check their account status and
 
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
more we currently have over 30 000
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
external GTC users about 2500 are
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
third-party preparers and 28 000 are
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers themselves so that's a huge
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
step forward for customer service for
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's where we are for 22 and 23 that's
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
all I had prepared for today and I'm
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
It's a combination So within the
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
contract we have negotiated hourly rates
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
so it's the hourly rates that we
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
negotiated in the contract and it's for
 
00:26:39.409 --> 00:26:39.419 align:start position:0%
five to six of what we call fasties the
 
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
vendor is fast Enterprises five or six
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
fasties to stay on at time and materials
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
that were negotiated as part of the
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
project and the number of five to six
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
has been a joint
 
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
um decision between the vendor and dra
 
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
in terms of again not wanting too many
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
but making sure that we have the right
 
00:26:59.570 --> 00:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
level of support
 
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:08.470 align:start position:0%
level of support
foreign

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
My Hope Is that we will always have a
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
few on site
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
um just because of their knowledge and
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
expertise within the system I do think
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
that in as we move forward we might find
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
that five is more than we need and we
 
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
might be fine with two or three
 
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
um but that will kind of depend as we
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
continue to move out of this
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
implementation phase and more into
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
actual the actual operation phase
 
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:57.909 align:start position:0%
actual the actual operation phase
foreign

00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
that was our expenses for 22 18.7
 
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.250 align:start position:0%
that was our expenses for 22 18.7
million

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:03.260 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's total expenses right so and then
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
when you remove
 
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
the non-revenue collecting expenses is
 
00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:27.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:30.299 align:start position:0%
correct roughly I think I did
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
correct it would be about yes 10 to 15
 
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
maybe 13 I think actually when I did out
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
we're currently about 15 so on November
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
15th we had 133 filled positions 27
 
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.070 align:start position:0%
15th we had 133 filled positions 27
bacon

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
bacon
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
and what we've really seen is the
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lot of opportunity for Dre
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
employees to receive promotions so we
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
have folks that have been promoted
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
within their division
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
um just last week I signed off on two
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
hires of people moving into a different
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
division you know so a slightly
 
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
different career path but we're doing
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
our very best to retain the employees
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
that we have right we taught them taxes
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
we'd like them to stay and so most of
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
our vacancies at this point are at more
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
of our entry level positions and so
 
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
we're able to keep morale High by making
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
sure that the folks have the opportunity
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
for promotions and rewarding folks with
 
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
those when they become available
 
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:52.750 align:start position:0%
those when they become available
foreign

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning commissioner I just
 
00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:06.059 align:start position:0%
wanted you could talk a little bit about
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
how uh and we we dealt with a little bit
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
with sweet but how technology has
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
enabled you with with the work shortage
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
that not only your department says but
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
but the entire country is facing that uh
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
how that technology has helped you uh
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
bridge that Gap with your uh with your
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate and and how you can use
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
that technology maybe going forward or
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
the next biennium sure so
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
really especially now that we have
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
upgraded to Rams I mean technology is
 
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
how dra runs
 
00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
very simply there's basically two ways
 
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
you can file a tax return today you can
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
file it online either through the
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
modernized e-file system which is done
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
through the IRS or through granite tax
 
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
connect our online portal from rims if
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
you don't file online you're going to
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
send us a paper return
 
00:30:59.330 --> 00:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
we're going to open it and we're going
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
to put it through our scanner that
 
00:31:03.889 --> 00:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
scanner can has optical character
 
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
recognition so it can read what is on
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
the return or many Returns come in with
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
one of those 2D barcodes at the end
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
where all of the information is pulled
 
00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:15.299 align:start position:0%
right out of that barcode so take dra
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
back 15 years that return would have
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
come in and it would have been hand
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
keyed everything would have been hand
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
keyed into the system it would have
 
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
taken months now we either get the
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
information off the form
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
or it's electronically filed what the
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
staff does at that point is they verify
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
the amounts if it is a paper return
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
they'll go in and say all right the
 
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
scanner thought this was a hundred was
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
it really a hundred dollars yes and they
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
they do more of data validation as
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
opposed to straight up data entry that
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
allows us to process all of our returns
 
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
by the end of each month so October is a
 
00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
very large filing month for us Returns
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
on extension all of our returns that we
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
received in October were in the system
 
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
as the last as of the last day of
 
00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.630 align:start position:0%
as the last as of the last day of
October

00:31:59.630 --> 00:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
October
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
then once it's into the system rims does
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
its work so there's some automated
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
processes in rims
 
00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
um also the rims will allow us to
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
prioritize certain types of work so when
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
you're processing a return you want to
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
First prioritize those returns with
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
money right the hundred dollars came in
 
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
with that return we want that money to
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
go into the bank next we're going to
 
00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
prioritize returns that didn't have
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
enough money we're going to want to get
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
that bill out to that taxpayer as soon
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
as possible so the state can receive the
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
money next we're going to prioritize
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
refunds we're going to want to get that
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
money back to the taxpayer so that we
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
don't pay interest and so that the
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayer receives the money as quickly
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
as possible rims allows us to prioritize
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
all of that we can see how many
 
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
documents are within each queue and so
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
we can allocate our resources
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
appropriately so when we're down some
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
number of Staff we'll know okay hey guys
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
you have to work on this today rather
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
than just kind of a free-for-all in
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
terms of whatever returns had come in
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
once the returns are processed refunds
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
are processed bills are sent out I
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 2.3 million dollars we
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
generated just from sending an automated
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
reminder to pay letter that in the past
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
would have been work that would not have
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
gotten done until it made it to the
 
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
collections division so that's work that
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
the system is able to do
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
um on its own automated without having
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
bodies or people that needed to do that
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
so when we have vacancies and
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
collections that fills up frees up some
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
of their work and then also even when
 
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
when collections is fully staffed rather
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
than reminding folks to pay their bills
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
they can focus on actual Collections and
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
collect more money at the end of the day
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
so that's really everything we do at dra
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
these days is related to technology
 
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:52.909 align:start position:0%
these days is related to technology
um

00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
and the sweep requests that we asked for
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
and received will just enhance and allow
 
00:33:59.810 --> 00:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
us to do more with the technology that
 
00:34:05.649 --> 00:34:05.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you okay well thank you
 
00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you okay well thank you

so next up we have the Department of
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.500 --> 00:35:05.089 align:start position:0%
 
anyways

00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:22.609 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:31.250 align:start position:0%
 
why

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.589 align:start position:0%

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning Governor good
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
morning Mr budget director commissioner
 
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
all members of the panel uh my name is
 
00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
John from Ella attorney general
 
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
department of justice I'm joined this
 
00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:44.339 align:start position:0%
morning by Kathy Carr our director of
 
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
administration so I will try to answer
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
all the questions but if I miss one I'm
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
going to rely on Kathy to fill in the
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
fill in the gaps
 
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.329 align:start position:0%
fill in the gaps
so

00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're happy to be here with the
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present our budget for
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 24-25. I wanted to start
 
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
out just by giving kind of an overview
 
00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:04.140 align:start position:0%
of the department we didn't originally
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
include an organizational chart in our
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
presentation because we're redoing our
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
org chart so the one I've passed out is
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit out of date but it does
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
help you it helps give a just an overall
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
picture of the office so on slide two I
 
00:36:20.089 --> 00:36:20.099 align:start position:0%
just give a list of you know the many
 
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
roles of the Attorney General so the
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
attorney general has multiple jobs and
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
through that the Department of Justice
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
has has a number of functions the first
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
is chief law enforcement officer we
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
supervise all law enforcement in the
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
state we work on policy for law
 
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement we coordinate with law
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement Chief prosecutor we
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
prosecute cases within the Department of
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
Justice and we also supervise all of the
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
County attorneys around the state chief
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
legal officer we provide legal advice
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
and client counseling to All State
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
agencies and we defend All State
 
00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:50.099 align:start position:0%
agencies when they're sued public
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
protection the attorney general has
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
constitutional and common law locations
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to public protection though
 
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
there's sort of no firm border around
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
those the AG and the Department of
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
Justice have broad authority to
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
intervene in cases where they think the
 
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:05.579 align:start position:0%
the protection of the public is is a
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
play and then of course the AEG has to
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
be head of the Department of Justice so
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
functions as a commissioner and then we
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
also head up the state's drug task force
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
which operates throughout the state but
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
focuses mostly on the North country in
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
the southwest part of the state where
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
the police departments are smaller and
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
there are less they're less resources in
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
local departments so we help supplement
 
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
those resources through our drug task
 
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.190 align:start position:0%
those resources through our drug task
force

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
force
 
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
as you'll see with the organizational
 
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
chart the department is broken down at a
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
high level into two divisions the
 
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
division of public protection that
 
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
contains the criminal justice Bureau the
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Bureau and the
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and Anti-Trust
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
Bureau the division of public protection
 
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
is best thought of for shorthand as as
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
the Criminal part of the office and then
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
the other division the division of legal
 
00:37:56.569 --> 00:37:56.579 align:start position:0%
counsel for shorthand is best thought of
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
the Civil part of the office there is
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
some crossover and overlap between the
 
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
two public protection does some civil
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
work legal counsel does some criminal
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
work but for the most part it breaks
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
down between criminal and civil under
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
Kathy Carr the director Administration
 
00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
we also have our business office our
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
victims compensation unit and our grants
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
management unit and then the office of
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
the solicitor general functions kind of
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
as a standalone entity within the office
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking for some tweaks in hb2
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
to clarify that but it functions as a
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
standalone entity it handles appeals so
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
we handle all Criminal Appeals in the
 
00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:34.619 align:start position:0%
state and we also handle Civil Appeals
 
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
where the state is a party so the office
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
of the solicitor general really does
 
00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099 align:start position:0%
Criminal and civil work
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
so that's a high level overview of the
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
department we currently have 166
 
00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:49.220 align:start position:0%
authorized positions so those include
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
full-time positions that does not
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
include part-time and temporary
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
positions we have a few temporary
 
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
positions right now including our YDC
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
positions which we don't expect to last
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
forever but to last for the next few
 
00:39:01.619 --> 00:39:03.650 align:start position:0%
forever but to last for the next few
years

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
the next slide that that's in front of
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
you slide three just gives a snapshot of
 
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
some statistics I won't run through
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
these one by one but this is just uh
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
some highlights of of the things we've
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
handled over the past couple of years so
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%
we do one of the one of the functions
 
00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
that I'll point out is just our consumer
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
protection hotline we're really the only
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
entity in the state that takes those
 
00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
types of calls so when consumers have an
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
issue with a business or they think
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
they've been ripped off by a contractor
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
it's the Department of Justice that they
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
call and it's the Consumer Protection
 
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
Bureau that does that work that looks at
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
those complaints that prosecutes those
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
cases that's just one example of where
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
in this state the Attorney General's
 
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
office acts as kind of the catch-all
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
where County attorneys may not have the
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
resources to take complaints in
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
prosecute cases we do that work and it's
 
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:54.260 align:start position:0%
real on the ground constituent service
 
00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
what some might call small dollar cases
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
but they're the types of cases that the
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
average person experiences you know most
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
people don't experience a multi-million
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
dollar case the app average person might
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
experience an issue with their
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
contractor where they're out ten
 
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars but to an average
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
person that that's a lot of money and
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
that's potentially life-changing so the
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
work that the department does really
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
spans from that type of work all the way
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
up to the high profile homicides and the
 
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar cases that you see
 
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:22.420 align:start position:0%
uh in the news
 
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.470 align:start position:0%
uh in the news
[Music]

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
with that I just I'll go into giving a
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
high level overview of our efficiency
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
budget the first thing to note which is
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
on page six
 
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
of the presentation is that we are a
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
mostly non-general-funded agency a good
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
chunk of our budget is General funds
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
about 38 but most of our budget is
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
either federal funds or other funds or
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
interagency transfers or Highway funds
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
it's Highway funds that fund our
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
transportation and construction Bureau
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
so that's that's important thing to keep
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
in mind when you're thinking about the
 
00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
total budget for the Department of
 
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.910 align:start position:0%
total budget for the Department of
Justice

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
so going to page eight
 
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
just on the efficiency budget highlights
 
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
the first thing I should note I did not
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
include this in the presentation but it
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
is important
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
we came in over Target in our efficiency
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
budget from a general fund standpoint
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
but if if you look at the the overall
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
budget in the budget booklet our total
 
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized and efficiency for
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 was 40 million three
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
hundred ninety thousand sixty four
 
00:41:33.839 --> 00:41:34.730 align:start position:0%
hundred ninety thousand sixty four
dollars

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
and our fiscal 24 efficiency budget is
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
40 million one hundred and eight
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred sixty four and
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
for 25 the efficiency budget is 40
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
the important point to make there is
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
that we are basically flat in our
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget from fiscal year 24 to
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
24.25 but where there are a couple
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
components that are causing our general
 
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
fund spend to go up which I'll talk
 
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
about now
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
the first that you see on page eight
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh says position moves
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is moving
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
positions out of our consumer consumer
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
escrow fund to the general fund so the
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
consumer protection escrow fund right
 
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
now funds a number of positions within
 
00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
the department and it's always really
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
been intended to fund the positions that
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
work within the consumer protection and
 
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
antitrust Bureau
 
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
that fund brings in a fair amount of
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
money or has brought in a fair amount of
 
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
money over the years with large
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
multi-state settlements other fines and
 
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.010 align:start position:0%
multi-state settlements other fines and
penalties

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
each year we're allowed to keep up to 5
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
million and whatever is over 5 million
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
in that fund gets swept to the general
 
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.810 align:start position:0%
in that fund gets swept to the general
fund

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
for many years that fund has given a lot
 
00:42:52.609 --> 00:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
of money back to the general fund so we
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
brought in far more than 5 million a
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
year the past few years we've seen
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
multi-state settlements Trend down I
 
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
think part of the reason for that is
 
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
covid but I also think the dynamic
 
00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:05.339 align:start position:0%
between attorney general offices around
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
the country and the business Community
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
is changing businesses are pushing back
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
on some of these efforts I think offices
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
are bringing less of these cases because
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
they're trying to work with the business
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
community and be more collaborative so
 
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
it's not the cash cow that it has been
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
in past years it still brings in
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
sufficient funding
 
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
but one thing we saw probably over the
 
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
past four or five years is that because
 
00:43:30.609 --> 00:43:30.619 align:start position:0%
that fund was bringing in a lot of money
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
gradually positions that were not
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
actually within the Consumer Protection
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau were being moved on to that Fund
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
in other words that fund was paying for
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
non-consumer Protection Bureau positions
 
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
what we're proposing to do in this
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
budget and requesting to do is move I
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
think it's six positions
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
out of that fund into the general fund
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
those six positions are positions that
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
are not part of the consumer protection
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
and antitrust Bureau so it's it's my
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation and proposal that we move
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
those positions back on to the general
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
fund for a couple reasons one is I have
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
a concern that over the long term the
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
consumer escrow fund is not going to
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
bring in enough money year to year to
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
fund positions that aren't related to
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Protection Bureau so that's
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
one concern the second concern is I just
 
00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:23.579 align:start position:0%
think from an Institutional standpoint
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's better from an incentive alignment
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
point of view to not have a bureau you
 
00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
know have to bring in money so have to
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
bring lawsuits or have to impose fines
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
and penalties to to pay for itself or
 
00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
pay for everything that it's responsible
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
for so I think long term institutionally
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea to move those positions
 
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
back on to the general fund at the end
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
of the day it's a it's kind of a wash
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
financially because in years where we
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
bring in a lot of money anything over 5
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
million is going to go back to the
 
00:44:58.609 --> 00:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
general fund anyway and in years where
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
we might be shorter or under 5 million
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
by having less positions on that fund
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's less of a chance that you have
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
to make a budget adjustment so that's a
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
big part of why we came in over Target
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
in the general fund component of our
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
the second reason we came in over Target
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
was just benefit increases we have we've
 
00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
been pretty successful with Recruitment
 
00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
and Retention and bringing in new
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys along the spectrum of
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
experience but one thing we're seeing
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
which I think is good for the state
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
are a lot of young families our
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
demographic are is attorneys with young
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
families and young families bring High
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
benefit costs so that that's another
 
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
reason for us coming in over Target in
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
another big component of our efficiency
 
00:45:49.319 --> 00:45:51.950 align:start position:0%
another big component of our efficiency
request

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
which doesn't result in an increase in
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
spend but results in an increase in the
 
00:45:59.569 --> 00:45:59.579 align:start position:0%
number of full-time positions that the
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
department would have is our assistant
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
eight assistant Deputy medical examiners
 
00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:11.900 align:start position:0%
or admes they are basically the
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
investigators for our chief medical
 
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
examiner and deputy chief medical
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
examiner so admes if there's a death
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
they go out to the scene they
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
investigate they do an external
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the body and they gather
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
information for the medical examiners in
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
the event that the medical examiner is
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
going to do an autopsy so admes operate
 
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
all over the state they're an important
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
component of the office of chief medical
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
examiner and they
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
they right now they are contractors so
 
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
that presents a challenge for us a
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
if you look on uh page 10 of the
 
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.970 align:start position:0%
if you look on uh page 10 of the
presentation

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
there are a number of issues with having
 
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
admes as contractors they've been
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
contractors for a long time but the IRS
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
has raised concerns with that structure
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
in the past the reason is that while
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
admes are contractors in many ways they
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
function as employees they they can be
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to manage when they're not
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
employees because they're contractors
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're all over the state and
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have the the level of control
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
over them that we would have if they
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
were employees we sometimes struggle
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
with coverage in certain parts of the
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
state and when admes are are contractors
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
and not employees we don't have as much
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility to send them to different
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
areas of the state
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
um so we are proposing in this budget if
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
something Governor you're interested in
 
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
and then the team is interested in to
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
convert the admes from contractors to
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
full-time employees we think we can do
 
00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.390 align:start position:0%
full-time employees we think we can do
this

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
and actually have our total spend go
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
down slightly because right now we're
 
00:47:55.619 --> 00:47:59.390 align:start position:0%
down slightly because right now we're
paying

00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.849 --> 00:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
if you look on page 12 of our
 
00:48:01.859 --> 00:48:04.370 align:start position:0%
if you look on page 12 of our
presentation

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
The Five-Year average spend
 
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
for admes for paying for them to be
 
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
contractors is one million three hundred
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
sixty seven thousand one hundred and
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars
 
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
and our total request which would
 
00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:20.099 align:start position:0%
involve converting these contractors to
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
10 full-time employees with some
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
additional expenses would be one million
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
269 532 dollars in fiscal year twenty
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
four and one million 282 1 158 in fiscal
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
year 25.
 
00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
so we think there are we think there are
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
advantages to having the admes be
 
00:48:40.609 --> 00:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
full-time employees and we actually
 
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
think we can reduce the total spend by
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
doing that so I think there are some
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
efficiencies there so we thought we
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
would propose that in this budget this
 
00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
is also something that Dr Duvall our
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
chief medical examiner and Dr Weinberg
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
our deputy chief medical examiner are
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
strongly supportive of and they have
 
00:48:59.809 --> 00:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
asked for this they believe that their
 
00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099 align:start position:0%
their operation will will be much more
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
efficient and much easier to manage if
 
00:49:07.609 --> 00:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
if we make this conversion
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
as you know we've also struggled now for
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half to hire a third
 
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
medical examiner we do have an open
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
position for a third medical examiner
 
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
and Dr Duvall and Dr Weinberg think that
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
by making this conversion we'll be more
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
in line with other states and we will be
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
more competitive from a recruiting and a
 
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
retention standpoint we'll this will
 
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
just bring us up to par with other
 
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.730 align:start position:0%
just bring us up to par with other
states

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
so that is that's a big part of our
 
00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget and while it doesn't
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
result in a overall spending increase it
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
does result in 10 new positions so we
 
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
know that that is always something that
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
both the governor and the legislature
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
think seriously about adding that many
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
full-time positions to the state roles
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
happy to answer more questions on that
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
but that's a high level overview of that
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
so that is that's our efficiency budget
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
in in a nutshell
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I've hit it pretty quickly but again
 
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
we are while we're increasing our
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
general fund spend we are basically flat
 
00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:11.579 align:start position:0%
in the efficiency budget so I think we
 
00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:14.339 align:start position:0%
we overall from a total spend standpoint
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
certainly came under the three percent
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
Target but we did exceed that Target
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
next I'll just go into our prioritized
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
needs we do have about
 
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
on top of an efficiency budget of
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
roughly 40 million dollars we do have
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
total prioritized needs request of
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
roughly 9 million dollars but I think
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
that number sounds higher than it really
 
00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
is and I'll explain why
 
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
if you look at page 14 of our
 
00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.109 align:start position:0%
if you look at page 14 of our
presentation

00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
this lists out
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
our major requests and prioritized needs
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
the first one that jumps right off the
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
page is the litigation fund request
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
that's five million dollars
 
00:50:57.839 --> 00:50:59.450 align:start position:0%
that's five million dollars
typically

00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
the governor and you and the legislature
 
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
don't actually budget our full
 
00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:05.900 align:start position:0%
litigation fund needs in the budget
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
typically we get maybe a few hundred
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
thousand then we go back to fiscal as
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
needed to get litigation funds
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
our litigation fund spend has been going
 
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
up in recent years so I felt it would be
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
prudent to include this in our budget
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
requests just to sort of give everyone a
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
sense of what we think we will spend
 
00:51:26.089 --> 00:51:26.099 align:start position:0%
but that is five million dollars of our
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs so that's that's a big
 
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
chunk in our prioritized needs that
 
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
typically wouldn't even be budgeted but
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
we felt it was important to present that
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
to you for consideration as to whether
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
you might want to budget part of that
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
the next big piece of our prioritized
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
needs is rent for the new space that
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
we'll be moving to over a granted place
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
that lease was just approved as we know
 
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
last week at the exec at the governor
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
and council meeting so because we will
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
now be renting a non-state building at
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
least for the first year
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
our rent is much higher from a budget
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
perspective than it than it has been so
 
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
in talking with Das we felt it was most
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate to include that in in
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs it's certainly a need
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
you know we would not have come anywhere
 
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
close to our general fund Target had we
 
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
included that in the efficiency budget
 
00:52:19.609 --> 00:52:19.619 align:start position:0%
so that's another big piece of our
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
the third piece is autopsy expenses we
 
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.089 align:start position:0%
the third piece is autopsy expenses we
and

00:52:26.089 --> 00:52:26.099 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is we this is in prioritized needs
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
because this includes mostly expenses
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
for locums so essentially temporary
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
medical examiners to fill in when our
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
medical examiners aren't available I
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
think we have enough inefficiency to get
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
by but there's some additional budget
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
space that that we would like and so
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
we've included that in prioritized needs
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
we included some money for attorney
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
raises in our efficiency budget we
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
included some additional money for
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
raises and prioritized needs again I
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
think we we met the Baseline in our
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget but as we all know
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
with inflation and with the competitive
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
market there are some there's some
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
additional budget capacity we'd like to
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
have for attorney raises happy to answer
 
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
questions about that but we included
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
that in prioritized needs because while
 
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
I think it's important I don't think it
 
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
would be fair to say it's a it's a core
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
necessity given that we already had some
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
money for raises in our efficiency
 
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.190 align:start position:0%
money for raises in our efficiency
budget

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
the the last major component of our
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs as it is for many
 
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
agencies comes in positions
 
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
so if you look on page 15 of our
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
presentation that gives a snapshot of
 
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
the additional positions we're asking
 
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
for and prioritized needs we're
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
requesting six attorney positions two
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
investigator positions and five support
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
staff positions
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
on the next page page 16 goes into a bit
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:57.380 align:start position:0%
the attorney positions are
 
00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:00.980 align:start position:0%
in the Civil Bureau two civil litigators
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
one Criminal Justice attorney
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
one Environmental Protection Bureau
 
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.730 align:start position:0%
one Environmental Protection Bureau
attorney

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
One Transportation construction Bureau
 
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
attorney and one training attorney
 
00:54:15.069 --> 00:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
so the civil litigation
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
attorneys the easiest explanation for
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
the need for those can be seen in the
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
litigation Fund in the increase in
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
spending out of that fund that we've
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
seen over the past few years essentially
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
what happens is when we don't have
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
enough civil litigators to cover the
 
00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
work that we need to do to defend the
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
State against lawsuits that are brought
 
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
against the state we have to tap our
 
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
litigation fund by bringing in
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
assistance from outside Council and
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
tapping different e-discovery tools and
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
other things to help us manage documents
 
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
and manage our civil litigation load
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
we certainly could never
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate all of the litigation fund
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
spending by adding civil litigators but
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
I do think that our civil litigation
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
unit is under resourced and has been
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
under-resourced for some time and while
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
we currently have one vacancy there I
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
think we could use we could really use
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
two additional civil litigation
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
positions so that is the reason for that
 
00:55:10.079 --> 00:55:11.510 align:start position:0%
positions so that is the reason for that
request

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
the Criminal Justice attorney request
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
comes basically from our our Cold Case
 
00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
unit a couple years ago the legislature
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
added a second full-time attorney
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
position to the Cold Case unit I think
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
for very good reasons through covid we
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have the department did not have
 
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
the chance to increase the operations of
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
the Cold Case unit the way it wanted to
 
00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
and one of those positions was
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately unfunded in the last budget
 
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
when I came in I moved a position from
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the office into the
 
00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
Cold Case unit to expand it back to two
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
two full-time positions which we're
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
currently recruiting for now so this
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
additional Criminal Justice attorney
 
00:55:53.569 --> 00:55:53.579 align:start position:0%
position is essentially to
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
backfill the position I moved into the
 
00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
into the Cold Case unit
 
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Bureau
 
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
attorney position this is a request from
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
our Bureau but it's also a need that's
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
been expressed by the Department of
 
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services part of the
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
funding for that position comes from Des
 
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.230 align:start position:0%
funding for that position comes from Des
so

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
our I think the Environmental Protection
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau has been flat position wise for
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
for quite a few years there's a lot of
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
work there that Bureau doesn't just
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
handle Des it also handles energy work
 
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
and with the new Department of energy
 
00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
now being its own department and not
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
just the puc there's enough additional
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
work there that that we felt it was
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate to request a new position at
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
least in prioritized needs
 
00:56:42.049 --> 00:56:42.059 align:start position:0%
our transportation construction Bureau
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
which is kind of deceptively or
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
confusingly named I should say because
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
it covers not just the Department of
 
00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
Transportation but the department of
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
safety that Bureau could really use an
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
additional attorney because over the
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
past couple years as we know with all
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice reform efforts uh
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
the new litigation surrounding the EES
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
now that it's public all of the efforts
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
the department of safety has undertaken
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
there are just additional needs for the
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
department of safety that could be
 
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
served in that Bureau by a new attorney
 
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
there are also some temporary needs in
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
the short term that a new attorney could
 
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
help with given all of the money coming
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
in uh through the federal infrastructure
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
bill that the Department of
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation is is managing
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
and then the last attorney position is a
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
is a training attorney we currently have
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
one attorney who is uh essentially a
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
training prosecutor they both help train
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in the office they train
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
prosecutors out in the county attorney
 
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
offices given all the workforce
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
challenges right now that we're seeing
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
throughout the Criminal Justice System
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
including uh among the prosecute
 
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
prosecution bar we think it would be
 
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
helpful to have an additional training
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
attorney who can help all of the new
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
attorneys coming into the various County
 
00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:56.339 align:start position:0%
attorney offices around the state so
 
00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
that explains our position requests from
 
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
an attorney standpoint
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
support staff positions we have five
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
requests there one thing that I think is
 
00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:08.579 align:start position:0%
important to emphasize is that the
 
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice at the end of the
 
00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
day is is basically a law firm and while
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
when you think of a law firm the first
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
thing you think of is lawyers support
 
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
staff are just as critical and frankly
 
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
in many ways more critical than the
 
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
attorneys and I think the office has
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
fallen behind
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
in recent years from a support staff
 
00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.329 align:start position:0%
in recent years from a support staff
position

00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:28.339 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes in tough budget Cycles when
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
you have to make a cut and you're a law
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
firm your first instinct is not to cut
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
an attorney position it's to cut a
 
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
support staff position so part of what
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do here is is make up
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
for some of that we won't make up for
 
00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:45.299 align:start position:0%
all of that I don't think you can in one
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
budget cycle I don't think you should
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
try to in one budget cycle but adding
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
one civil paralegal and one civil Legal
 
00:58:54.289 --> 00:58:54.299 align:start position:0%
Assistant is part of the effort to make
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
up for that
 
00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
another position that we're asking for
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
on the support staff front is a HR
 
00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:04.250 align:start position:0%
on the support staff front is a HR
coordinator

00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to prioritizing our
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs I would say we
 
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
probably have no more important need
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Justice than an
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
HR coordinator the department has grown
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
big enough that I think we really need
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
someone dedicated to managing our human
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
resources issues I think a lot of
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
agencies have that function we have not
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
had that function our chief of staff
 
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
manages a lot of that but the chief of
 
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
staff is also an attorney and so having
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
having an HR coordinator to work with
 
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
the chief of staff to manage the many HR
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
needs that we have within our office is
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps our most important
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
prioritize need when it when it comes to
 
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.130 align:start position:0%
prioritize need when it when it comes to
positions

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
and then we also have two position
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
requests for our office of victim
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
witness assistance both an additional
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
victim witness Advocate and an
 
00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:53.299 align:start position:0%
additional victim Witness Program
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
specialist that office the office of
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
victim witness assistance is is a
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
critical component of the office because
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
it works with victims of crime it works
 
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
with Witnesses in our cases who often
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
are also victims as as you can imagine
 
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
with with various criminal cases
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
and it also does a lot of important
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
programming working with the Coalition
 
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
against Domestic and Sexual Violence
 
01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.059 align:start position:0%
with Casa with the child advocacy
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
centers around the state to train to
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
provide continuing education for these
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
various these various professionals
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
around the state so that office could
 
01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
use a bit more resources but we've
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
included that in prioritized needs
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
because I think the office is doing a
 
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
great job now that office can get by but
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
it could certainly use some additional
 
01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.829 align:start position:0%
it could certainly use some additional
resources

01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
so that is our presentation I know I ran
 
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339 align:start position:0%
through that pretty quickly happy to
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
answer answer questions I
 
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
have a couple of quick ones just so on
 
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.170 align:start position:0%
have a couple of quick ones just so on
the

01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
asmes I'm sorry the apmes you think a
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars is enough to cover the
 
01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
cost of 10 individuals am I bringing
 
01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
that right that sounds low but if that's
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
what it is that's that's what it is so
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's about one point
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh yeah oh yeah the total is 1.2 the 10
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
full-time positions is a million so
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
admes are different than medical
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
examiners they're not doctors right so
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
they they are basically technical
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
support staff for the medical examiners
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
so yeah based on the labor grade they
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
would be we think that's enough okay
 
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.370 align:start position:0%
would be we think that's enough okay
great

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.289 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay that's all I had
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay good morning uh one of the great
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
things about when you contract out is
 
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
typically you don't have to find the
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
employees you apply the contract and
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
they find the employees with the admes
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
if we go this route how confident are
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
you that you can be able to actually
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
find the employees to take these jobs
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and something
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
we've we've thought about as well I
 
01:01:56.809 --> 01:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
think Dr Dr Duvall and Dr Weinberg are
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
confident that we will be able to find
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
find people to fill these jobs uh it
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
goes without saying that there's a
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
chance we we may not be and if we aren't
 
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to have to to
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
reevaluate but but they're confident we
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
can find people to take these jobs
 
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
um we'd start with the individuals who
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
were currently using as contractors
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps not all of them would want to
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
work full-time but we think we're
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
confident that some of them some of them
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
will so we're confident we certainly
 
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
can't guarantee it but we think it's
 
01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:29.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
hi hi uh first of all your presentation
 
01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
is very pretty did you get it done at
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
graphic services
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
of course you did I noticed I'm going to
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
interrupt and say I did notice it was in
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
color and I encourage all the future
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
presentations to be in black and white
 
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
it looks very expensive foreign
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
in Kathy's case though having previously
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
run graphic Services I suspect she got a
 
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.730 align:start position:0%
run graphic Services I suspect she got a
deal

01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
um a couple of questions your Consumer
 
01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau and do you have stats
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
for maybe four or five years on how much
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's raised each year I know there's
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
the over over and above a number goes
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund I think that
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
might help make your case
 
01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
I don't expect you to have them with you
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so one slide I I glided right past
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
but probably to our disadvantages is
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
slide number four in the presentation
 
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.650 align:start position:0%
slide number four in the presentation
this

01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
this slide gives a high level overview
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
of the money that the Department of
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
Justice has brought in over the last two
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
years and it's
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
significant money so we've collected and
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
deposited 126.7 million dollars into the
 
01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:41.780 align:start position:0%
general fund over the last two years
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
that does not include the 52.7 million
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
dollars from the opioid the opioid
 
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
settlements and the Consumer Protection
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau did a lot of work on the on those
 
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
opioid cases
 
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
um the Consumer Protection Bureau itself
 
01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
just for consumers so getting
 
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
restitution for consumers collected 2.79
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
million dollars over the last two years
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
that's just a small component of what it
 
01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:05.750 align:start position:0%
that's just a small component of what it
collected

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
collected
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
so that that gives uh that gives a high
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
level overview that answers your
 
01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
question but we certainly have
 
01:04:14.569 --> 01:04:14.579 align:start position:0%
stats that give the exact amounts
 
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
brought into the consumer escrow fund
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
over the last few years which we could
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
provide both you and and the governor's
 
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.770 align:start position:0%
provide both you and and the governor's
team

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
team
 
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
that's great this is a great Slide by
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.299 align:start position:0%
um attorney raises I want to make a
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
reference to everybody here not
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
everybody will know this that collective
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement affects everybody
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
all classified and non-cut or
 
01:04:38.329 --> 01:04:38.339 align:start position:0%
unclassified employees one group of
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
people it does not affect is Attorneys
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Justice other than
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
the attorney and Deputy attorney general
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
and it's worth noting that
 
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
that's why nobody else has money in
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
their budget that way and that then that
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
you do and I think it's just not
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
everybody realizes that you there's this
 
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
one group of people that's paid a little
 
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
bit differently
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
um as our 2010 reform
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
the second thing I wanted to ask about
 
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
was ADM admes and it and it goes to the
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
budget directors question
 
01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.089 align:start position:0%
budget directors question
um

01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
hiring is it possible you end up in a
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
situation where you hire some positions
 
01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
and you have some people stay as
 
01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
contractors so in that sense the request
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
is scalable
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
yes that is possible the way I've
 
01:05:23.329 --> 01:05:23.339 align:start position:0%
thought about this is that if if the
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
governor and his team are
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
Grant this request then I think that
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
will entail some additional work working
 
01:05:32.089 --> 01:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
with the budget director working with
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
Kathy to structure this in a way that
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
allows for some flexibility on that
 
01:05:35.819 --> 01:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
allows for some flexibility on that
front

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
front
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
so I I think if if there's an interest
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
in moving forward with making that
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
conversion we can certainly assist with
 
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
that work to do it in a way that
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
allows it to be flexible in case we
 
01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:50.700 align:start position:0%
can't fill all the positions right away
 
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:54.230 align:start position:0%
can't fill all the positions right away
thanks

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning um this also
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
has to do with those positions I know
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
that during the federal IRS audits this
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
definitely has come up
 
01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:05.339 align:start position:0%
um in the Bureau of accounts area I know
 
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
they are subject to the they usually
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
deal with all the federal audits have we
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
gotten any penalties for these positions
 
01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
yet or is it just something that they've
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
come up and they've been concerned about
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
but we haven't actually been
 
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
if you had any penalties for it we've
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
not been issued any penalties and we've
 
01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
not been told definitively by the IRS
 
01:06:24.049 --> 01:06:24.059 align:start position:0%
that we have to do this I think the
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
concern has come up enough that that
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
that's a reason that it might be a good
 
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
idea to get out in front of it but I
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
would to be to be perfectly truthful and
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
transparent I don't see this as legally
 
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
required at this point could be down the
 
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
road and then just more of a general
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
question because a lot of your both in
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency and prioritize these are
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
position related what's your current
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
vacancy and with adding some of these
 
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
positions do you think that do you are
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
you struggling with the same Workforce
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
work for the shoes as everyone else
 
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.210 align:start position:0%
work for the shoes as everyone else
foreign

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so out of our 166 positions we do
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
currently have 20 vacancies between
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.319 --> 01:07:08.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'll say this one that's as of right now
 
01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
so I we've got some folks coming in to
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
especially in the civil litigation realm
 
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
I actually think part of well we have a
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
vacancy there
 
01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
part of our inability to retain in
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
certain areas of the office is the fact
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
that certain areas are under resourced
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
and so the people who are in those areas
 
01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.299 align:start position:0%
are are overworked but we have been
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
pretty successful in recruiting and
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
retention over the last year and a half
 
01:07:39.049 --> 01:07:39.059 align:start position:0%
so it it's certainly a fair question and
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
I think something for for us to think
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
about but we feel pretty confident we
 
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
can fill the positions if we get them
 
01:07:44.940 --> 01:08:15.049 align:start position:0%
can fill the positions if we get them
foreign

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.059 --> 01:09:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to invite the Human
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.179 --> 01:09:57.130 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:57.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
you want to move over or yeah I don't
 
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
hey I'd like to call this meeting back
 
01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
to order and again I'd like to invite
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
the Human Resources Commission for their
 
01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.410 align:start position:0%

testimony

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%

of The Human Rights Commission we are a
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
small state agency and
 
01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
small state agency and
um

01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
our opportunity is to help the citizens
 
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in the area of civil
 
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
rights and I'm very pleased to be here
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
this morning I don't usually have an
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be an advocate because we
 
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
we don't take a side in in the cases
 
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
that we have before us but today I get
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
to Advocate on behalf of my agency and
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%

the work day in and day out if you look
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
and we are at the back half of the
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice's presentation so
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
I believe we start on page 17 and if you
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
go right on to 18 well I will start with
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
Who We Are
 
01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
um so just a very brief history the
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
commission was established in 1965
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
and we are governed by RSA 354-a and
 
01:11:37.729 --> 01:11:37.739 align:start position:0%
um our purpose is to eliminate
 
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the areas of
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
employment housing and public
 
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
accommodation and as of 2019 K-12 public
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
education was included and public
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
education means Public Schools excuse me
 
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
Public Schools public academies as well
 
01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
as charter schools
 
01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
the commission is comprised of seven
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer Commissioners they are
 
01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
nominated by the governor and a point uh
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
confirmed excuse me by the executive
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
Council they serve a five-year term and
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
they come from various walks of life
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
each commissioner
 
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.209 align:start position:0%
each commissioner
um

01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity from the from
 
01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
their perspective of what area of Life
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
they come from whether they be business
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
owners people that are just in the
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
community whether they work with the
 
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
disability community and a variety of
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
other areas
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh the commission and on page 19 now the
 
01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:36.500 align:start position:0%
commission has the power to receive
 
01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:39.780 align:start position:0%
investigate and pass upon complaints of
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
illegal discrimination and we also are
 
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
responsible to engage in research
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
education and community outreach and all
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
of this is to help to prevent
 
01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:54.490 align:start position:0%
of this is to help to prevent
discrimination

01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:54.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
in addition to the authority vested to
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
the vested in the commission we also
 
01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
have a workshare agreement with the EEOC
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
our federal partner and the EEOC is the
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
United States equal employment
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity commission and we work with
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
them to enforce the federal laws as well
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
as the local state laws here in the
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to work towards
 
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
ending discrimination
 
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
on page 20 I have an organizational
 
01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:24.229 align:start position:0%
on page 20 I have an organizational
chart

01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
chart
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
and this is how we are currently
 
01:13:27.719 --> 01:13:29.630 align:start position:0%
and this is how we are currently
situated

01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
situated
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
um so there are five full-time
 
01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.110 align:start position:0%
um so there are five full-time
investigators

01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
um there's an intake coordinator that
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
job is now a full-time position there's
 
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
an assistant director who is
 
01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.310 align:start position:0%
an assistant director who is
specifically

01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
responsible for supervising the staff we
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
have a part-time paralegal and we also
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
um currently the administrative
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
assistant which is a part of our
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
organizational chart we still have that
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
position on the on the books so to speak
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
but it is unfunded and we have a
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
part-time intake coordinator and that
 
01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
position is currently unfunded
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll do a quick overview over on
 
01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
page 21 and the numbers so this is an
 
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
average of cases that we've taken in
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
cases that have been closed and our
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
average number of cases that we have per
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
year so the way that the commission
 
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
works with our federal
 
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
um workshare agreement we close a case
 
01:14:42.169 --> 01:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
and then we are basically reimbursed for
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
what the EEOC is offering for the
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
closure of that case and we have a
 
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
contract in that contract number changes
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
every year for this for federal fiscal
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
year 22 we have a contract amount of 200
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
cases but actually this year we were
 
01:15:02.689 --> 01:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
able to Upward modify and we actually
 
01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
closed 245 cases federal cases not
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
including the in-state Charge cases that
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
we have had and have closed
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
um our budget is in 85 15 so 85 percent
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
we are General funded 15 percent uh
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
covers uh is covered by our federal uh
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement work share agreement
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
and over on page 22
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
um I have a nice long list of
 
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
um certainly to reinstate the
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant position that
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
position has been unfunded since 2020 it
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
has been definitely a blessing to be to
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
be administratively attached to the
 
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice who helps us
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
tremendously with some of our
 
01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
administrative functions but to not have
 
01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
an administrative assistant has been a
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
challenge to say the least
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
um so to also reinstate funding for that
 
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
part-time intake coordinator in our
 
01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
intake department we could have as
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
little as nine cases
 
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
um that come in in a month or as many as
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
30 uh that we've had over the years it
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
really just depends but that person is
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
not simply taking in a charge there's a
 
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
lot of administrative paperwork that um
 
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
that accompanies that charge as well as
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
other elements of how we do our internal
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
process and having the additional set of
 
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
hands that part-time employee definitely
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
will make the difference
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
I'm also requesting four additional
 
01:16:44.169 --> 01:16:44.179 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination investigators
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
with having five currently we are doing
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
everything that we can do however having
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
more hands to pull from the pot so to
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
speak will certainly assist us in moving
 
01:16:59.209 --> 01:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
through what we currently have right now
 
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
as a case backlog and it will make a big
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
difference in helping constituents be
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
able to file charges appropriately to be
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
able to for us for us to be able to do
 
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
things in a very timely manner
 
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
and also adding an informational
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative of course there would be
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
a much snazzier title but that
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
individual will be responsible for
 
01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:25.850 align:start position:0%
individual will be responsible for
training

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
um that is part of our
 
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
um statute that we are supposed to do
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
Outreach Education and Training and
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
currently that is limited to the time
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
available for myself or for the
 
01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
assistant director to be able to provide
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
training and as any enforcement agency
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
would tell you certainly you can write
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
tickets and and serve fines but the way
 
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
that you work to assist people in no
 
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
longer doing whatever that action is is
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
through training and doing Outreach and
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
connecting with whether it's state
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
agencies non-profits or other
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
non-governmental entities to further the
 
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
information and making sure everyone is
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
is treating everyone fairly and in a
 
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory way
 
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
I'm also requesting the conversion of
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
two part-time positions So currently the
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
paralegal position which is funded would
 
01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
like to have that become a full-time
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
position as well as our part-time
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
secretary there is more than enough work
 
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
to be able to be done and the creation
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
of the paralegal position as of 2020
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
that individual is very
 
01:18:34.679 --> 01:18:35.770 align:start position:0%
that individual is very
um

01:18:35.770 --> 01:18:35.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
important in providing the legal support
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
work that's necessary for motions that
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
come in that we need to rule on as well
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
as preparing for hearings that we do
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
have and we take care of those in-house
 
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
and then having a full-time secretary is
 
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
certainly making sure that packages are
 
01:18:59.689 --> 01:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
received that information leaves
 
01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and in a in a proficient manner as
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
well as being available for projects
 
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
with our contract with the EEOC we are
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
also responsible in making sure that we
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
do Outreach events and so having someone
 
01:19:18.610 --> 01:19:18.620 align:start position:0%
that can feel phone calls and prepare
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
packets for workshops that we may do
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
whether free or charged is important to
 
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
and as well as funding a cost for a move
 
01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:32.420 align:start position:0%
to a new location
 
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
potentially There's an opportunity
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully to move with our partner the
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
doj something of that nature would be a
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
very logical step to have us in the same
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
building as them not only do they
 
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
represent the the Commission in times if
 
01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
we have need of legal representation but
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
it is also imperative with our
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
day-to-day work to be able to have our
 
01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:03.140 align:start position:0%
client Services
 
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
representative available for us and if
 
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
there are larger lawsuits that the
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
commission needs to engage upon on
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of the state as well as indeed
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
for our mission which is ending
 
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
discrimination to be right next door or
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
a floor above or below is a very logical
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
is a very logical step for us and
 
01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
in that the move of course costs money
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
and the larger space would have
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
certainly be more money because we need
 
01:20:36.530 --> 01:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
additional space if these additional
 
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.850 align:start position:0%
additional space if these additional
um

01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
staff members that I'm requesting are
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
are awarded to us we will need a larger
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
space we need a hearing space
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
etc etc and of course there are doit
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
shared costs that are always a part of
 
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs budget so with
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
that I will end and if there are any
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to answer them yeah
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much first good morning
 
01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
and morning again and on on page 21 you
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
have a list of the are there a number of
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
the cases filed per month over a
 
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
12-month period of 193. uh and then the
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
case is closed two-part question
 
01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
how long is it take to typically close a
 
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:24.659 align:start position:0%
case once it's filed and and two is 193
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
a big number large number historically
 
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
is that is the problem getting worse
 
01:21:31.729 --> 01:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
better staying the same how does that
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
number work historically okay thank you
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
um so uh I I would not say worse
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I would say that uh in terms of the
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
193 number and the which you're quoting
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
is the case is filed
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
um I think part of it is that
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
um there has been some Outreach there
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
has been some education over the past
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
few years people are beginning to
 
01:21:57.890 --> 01:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
understand more and more what their
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
rights are and I think there's become
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
some clarity in that I think I may have
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
been discriminated against there's a
 
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
place that I can go to get to to find
 
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
out if this is the case and we take a
 
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
charge based on what the person filing
 
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
the charge is telling us and obviously
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
there has to be an investigation to
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
determine if there is what we call
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
probable cause if this discrimination
 
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
did happen or not or sometimes we have a
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
situation where someone so there was
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination but the company actually
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
took did what we call prompter prompt
 
01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
remedial action and did everything they
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
were supposed to do the person still can
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
file a charge with us if they so desire
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
and then we would go through the process
 
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
to determine if the I shouldn't say if
 
01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
the charge is Merit but if if there's
 
01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
further action that needs to be taken
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
based on the investigative findings of
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
the commission so that part to answer
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
that first part
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
um with that said
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
on the average 193 it actually Ebbs and
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
flows every year so at the very least
 
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
what we're going to have is whatever our
 
01:23:16.729 --> 01:23:16.739 align:start position:0%
contract number is because that's what
 
01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
we're obligated to to
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
um to provide in terms of fulfilling our
 
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
work our portion of the workshare
 
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
agreement with the EEOC so there are
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
some here so for example this year we uh
 
01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:34.219 align:start position:0%
this past Federal fiscal year 22. we had
 
01:23:38.689 --> 01:23:38.699 align:start position:0%
245 cases so there could be more there
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
could be fewer
 
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
um it really it really does depend right
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
now where we are is we have a pending
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
file so we have cases that are waiting
 
01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
for investigation and we have a little
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
over 200 of those that are currently
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
waiting investigation which is why I'm
 
01:24:00.649 --> 01:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
asking for the four additional
 
01:24:00.659 --> 01:24:02.229 align:start position:0%
asking for the four additional
investigators

01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:05.219 align:start position:0%
we have a situation where once the
 
01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
person brings a charge and it's docketed
 
01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
and both parties are notified moves very
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
smoothly and that is of course based on
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
when the complainant will bring the
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
charge once the case is invested excuse
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
me once the case is assigned it moves
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
pretty smoothly through to investigation
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
to a determination whether it goes to
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
court whether it goes to a hearing with
 
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
us whether the parties settle that moves
 
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
pretty smoothly the the hiccup happens
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
in between once it's docketed prior to
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
being assigned that's where it's waiting
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
obviously they're going to be outlier
 
01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
cases sometimes they're things that are
 
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
very complex sometimes there's a a
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy for example and we would have
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
to stay and wait until those proceedings
 
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
go those are the outliers on average
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
um it it may take a year once it's
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
assigned to completion there are some
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
that are that long some that are more
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
complex there are some that could be
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
three six months it just depends so I
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
know that's not the pinpoint answer but
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
it's kind of it's a moving Target
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
because it really depends on the
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
complexity of the case how many elements
 
01:25:20.209 --> 01:25:20.219 align:start position:0%
are in the case so that makes it a
 
01:25:25.209 --> 01:25:25.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:27.620 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to note that the
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
commission and I are the same age
 
01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.810 align:start position:0%
commission and I are the same age
um

01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
that was nice
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
um we were both established in 1965.
 
01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:40.070 align:start position:0%
um we were both established in 1965.
um

01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
you have uh 193 cases filed 276 closed
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
and the number that's greater is the
 
01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
reverse of what I would have expected so
 
01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
you closed 50 more cases than were filed
 
01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
I'd suggest a backlog
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
still yes so within that year within
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
this time
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
um we have there there are these other
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
considerations so we have staff turnover
 
01:26:08.110 --> 01:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes and so when a person leaves
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
their caseload is then reassigned to
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
other investigators that remain and so
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's on top of whatever their regular
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
caseload is and so those cases that are
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
awaiting assignment will need to wait a
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
little longer until
 
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
we're able to to move through the cases
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
that were reassigned and
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
um and so for for this year specifically
 
01:26:37.129 --> 01:26:37.139 align:start position:0%
um even with with investigator turnover
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
we had two investigators leave the
 
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
commission we still were able to Upward
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
modify and close an additional 45 more
 
01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
cases than we were contracted to close
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the EEOC yes we do get paid for
 
01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.530 align:start position:0%
with the EEOC yes we do get paid for
those

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
um sometimes they'll allow even more so
 
01:26:59.209 --> 01:26:59.219 align:start position:0%
we we go back to the well and we do ask
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
for additional funds but the the way it
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
works as you can I'm sure you can assume
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
here but cases come in that doesn't stop
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
and so as they're coming in we when we
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
pull from those that are waiting we take
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
from the oldest and move to the newest
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's a part of that
 
01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.610 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's a part of that
number

01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
I mean it's nice to see that you're
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
reducing the backlog
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
um the only other thing I would add is
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
that on Space you don't seem to I
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
understand the need for space but you
 
01:27:32.689 --> 01:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
um in my prioritized needs I did put in
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
the money for the move
 
01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
oh where's the move I'm sorry where's
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.930 --> 01:28:07.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
so it's in the efficiency instead of the
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
prioritize oh okay that's great yeah how
 
01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
much are you anticipating the new rent
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
um I am not sure we are still working
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
with the Department of administrative
 
01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.570 align:start position:0%
with the Department of administrative
services

01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
fine sir uh to to get a uh an actual
 
01:28:27.239 --> 01:28:28.430 align:start position:0%
fine sir uh to to get a uh an actual
Target

01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
Target
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
um the estimate was around two hundred
 
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars I'm certainly hoping it
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
will be much less than that
 
01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:43.370 align:start position:0%
will be much less than that
oh

01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
well I'll just I'll just make it and
 
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
then we should talk about moving costs
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
too because yes
 
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
yes ask Kathy how much she she has to
 
01:28:52.689 --> 01:28:52.699 align:start position:0%
set aside
 
01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
I think it's a million dollars to move
 
01:28:57.649 --> 01:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
doj oh
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'm sorry it was
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
one other thing so on I think it was on
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
page 22 at the bottom
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
um just to add to the moving thank you
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
for for asking that question
 
01:29:17.209 --> 01:29:17.219 align:start position:0%
um commissioner arlinghaus
 
01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
um our lease where we are currently it
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
expires uh October of 2023 and we do not
 
01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
have a renewal uh opportunity at this
 
01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.610 align:start position:0%
have a renewal uh opportunity at this
point

01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh the building is up for sale so
 
01:29:35.410 --> 01:29:35.420 align:start position:0%
fingers crossed
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to invite The Liquor

01:30:14.290 --> 01:30:14.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:16.970 align:start position:0%

thank you
[Music]

01:30:24.970 --> 01:30:24.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:28.970 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:33.050 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
the governor and I are most appreciative
 
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:56.689 --> 01:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Liquor Commission oh
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
thanks Tina and with me is Tina dimirs
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
our CFO just a couple of brief numbers
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
before we get into the presentation I
 
01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to uh let you know that um
 
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
our total net profit from The Liquor
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
Commission year to day through October
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
31st is a 54 million dollars we've
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
transferred 11.5 million dollars to the
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
alcohol Abuse Prevention and treatment
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
fund and revenue before additional funds
 
01:31:30.649 --> 01:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
to HHS is 42.5 million so that puts us
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
on plan where half of us a half a
 
01:31:37.129 --> 01:31:37.139 align:start position:0%
percent below plan at this point
 
01:31:39.610 --> 01:31:39.620 align:start position:0%
for the year
 
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh let's see our retail numbers are down
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
uh 4.25 or 13.6 million even though
 
01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:49.139 align:start position:0%
we're on plan
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're pretty pleased with that given
 
01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.490 align:start position:0%
we're pretty pleased with that given
that

01:31:52.490 --> 01:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
the structure of the economy at this
 
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.610 align:start position:0%
the structure of the economy at this
point

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
and we feel due to the lack of employees
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to expand our summer
 
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
hours this year and we weren't able to
 
01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
expand holiday hours this year so we
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
feel that given those additional
 
01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
employees when the time comes when we
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
get to that point we would have been on
 
01:32:13.139 --> 01:32:14.090 align:start position:0%
get to that point we would have been on
plan

01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
or above plan
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars to US is on plan
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
so we're down at this point about a
 
01:32:23.689 --> 01:32:23.699 align:start position:0%
hundred part-time employees and about 40
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go to the presentation
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
so on page two the introduction is that
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission is self-funded
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
in a separate fund outside of the
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
and none of our Appropriations are used
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
none of general fund Appropriations are
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
used to maintain our operations
 
01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:52.460 align:start position:0%
now last year we did
 
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
771 million dollars in F-22
 
01:32:59.689 --> 01:32:59.699 align:start position:0%
it shows that we operated 67 retail
 
01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:00.770 align:start position:0%
it shows that we operated 67 retail
outlets

01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
outlets
 
01:33:04.129 --> 01:33:04.139 align:start position:0%
Niner state-owned 58 or leased and at
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
the budget presented is a level funding
 
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
necessary to accomplish the commission's
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
so on page three are our Revenue
 
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
estimates and since we're self-funded
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
our projected revenue is dependent on
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
the budget that we are requesting and as
 
01:33:32.209 --> 01:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
the chairman mentioned we're on target
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
for this year's plan which we think is
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
notable in this ever-changing business
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
environment and unpredictable National
 
01:33:40.729 --> 01:33:40.739 align:start position:0%
economy especially since current year
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's important to also remind everyone
 
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
of the rsas governing the revenue
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
transfers prior to our transfer to the
 
01:33:53.209 --> 01:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
general fund and you'll see those on the
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page
 
01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.370 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page
um

01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
the first transfer is under RSA 17616
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
and this is calculated in our plan since
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's the five percent of the prior year
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
gross profit and this is on line two on
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
the table and then there's RSA 126 AAA
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
colon 3. and this one is not in our
 
01:34:15.290 --> 01:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
Revenue plan because it's the additional
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
funds by HHS and that is identified as
 
01:34:20.209 --> 01:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
line five
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
as additional transfer to granted
 
01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
as additional transfer to granted
advantage

01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the table that our liquor
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
and beer plant numbers are rows four and
 
01:34:34.129 --> 01:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
seven our liquor plan for FY 24 is 139.5
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
million and F 125 is 140.1 million beer
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
so if you go to page four this is a
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
listing of a major expense categories
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
and they correspond to the table and the
 
01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
line numbers identified on page five as
 
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
a map
 
01:34:59.209 --> 01:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
so I won't read through all the
 
01:35:00.649 --> 01:35:00.659 align:start position:0%
categories but there are a couple of
 
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
categories we think are important to
 
01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:03.470 align:start position:0%
categories we think are important to
highlight

01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
highlight
 
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
the first one is number one salaries and
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
benefits it's decreasing in FY 24 in
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
spite of us requesting the 28 new
 
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
positions that we have in our efficiency
 
01:35:16.129 --> 01:35:16.139 align:start position:0%
budget and this is because of a
 
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
reduction in overtime and part-time
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
budget requests and changes in positions
 
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
as a result of turnover
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
and the fy25 increase our result of
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
salary steps and benefit increases
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
the next notable items are number six
 
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
technology hardware and software and
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
number seven doit
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
these are both for increasing for
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs requests to
 
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
support the next-gen
 
01:35:48.649 --> 01:35:48.659 align:start position:0%
d365 software platform that is replacing
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
our current point of sale and back
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
office Financial system
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
the increase in technology hardware and
 
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
software is for subscription and
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
existing support and maintenance
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
contracts and the doit request is for
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
two new positions to support the new
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
system handheld devices and cloud
 
01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.330 align:start position:0%
system handheld devices and cloud
services

01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
you also see that a few of the
 
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
categories are underfunded in FY 23
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
based on the FY 22 spend which is
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
causing a greater percent of increase in
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
the FY 24 numbers and this is a result
 
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
of cost increases and shifts in business
 
01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:31.930 align:start position:0%
of cost increases and shifts in business
needs

01:36:31.930 --> 01:36:31.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
Pages six and seven these show the
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
annual breakdown by class and accounting
 
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
unit you'll see that the breakdown is
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
consistent for both years for the class
 
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
and the accounting units our FY
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
24 efficiency budget is increasing 2.3
 
01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
million or 2.7 percent more than the FY
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
23 adjusted authorized budget
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
plus there's a 3.3 million increase for
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
the additional prioritized needs which
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
brings us to a total increase of the 6.9
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
percent or 5.7 million and that 3.3
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
million is the increase in hardware and
 
01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
software technology hardware and
 
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
software and the doit
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh salaries and benefits and travel are
 
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
decreasing while the other categories
 
01:37:21.649 --> 01:37:21.659 align:start position:0%
are increasing due to cost inflation and
 
01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
projected needs such as utilities
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
equipment or Dent debt rent contracts
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
and then the doit and Technology
 
01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.850 align:start position:0%
and then the doit and Technology
software

01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
software
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then on page seven you have the fy25
 
01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
total budget it's 3.1 million or a 3.5
 
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
percent increase over the FY 24 total
 
01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
budget and this is for the salary step
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
increases and benefits and for the same
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
cost inflation and projected needs in
 
01:37:55.810 --> 01:37:55.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
so on page eight is our organizational
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
structure the commission is made up of
 
01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
three divisions that report to the
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and the Deputy Commissioner the
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
chart shows each division with the
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
number of unclassified and classified
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
positions assigned to each along with a
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
list of the Departments assigned
 
01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
you'll see in red the 28 new positions
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
we're requesting two are in audit and
 
01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
inventory control for an accountant and
 
01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
an additional internal auditor and this
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
was based on a recommendation from a
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
prior audit report
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh the other positions are under
 
01:38:33.649 --> 01:38:33.659 align:start position:0%
marketing and Merchandising two are in
 
01:38:36.169 --> 01:38:36.179 align:start position:0%
marketing uh one's for an additional
 
01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
marketing uh beverage marketing
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
specialist and a program assistant for
 
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
data research and Analysis
 
01:38:45.890 --> 01:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
and then there are the 24 new retail
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
store clerk positions that we're asking
 
01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
for for various retail outlets to meet
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
the needs of customers processing
 
01:38:54.649 --> 01:38:54.659 align:start position:0%
transactions and managing inventory in
 
01:38:58.330 --> 01:38:58.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
then you have page 9 through 13 and
 
01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
these are all a summary by division as
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're listed in the budget requests
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
with page references to the budget book
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh there's a pie chart on each showing
 
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
the breakdown by class category and an
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
explanation for major changes
 
01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
so the first is on page nine and this is
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
the office of the commission
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
the office of the commission is
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
overseeing all operations of the
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
commission with the primary goal to
 
01:39:29.689 --> 01:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
increase sales and maximize profits
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
while operating in a cost-effective and
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
efficient manner
 
01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
the one item to note is the increase in
 
01:39:42.169 --> 01:39:42.179 align:start position:0%
FY 24 of about 307 000. this is to add a
 
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
consultant line to support doit with the
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
next gen system we currently are paying
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
for that out of another class line for
 
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
FY 23 so we wanted to add it for the
 
01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
2425 budget
 
01:39:55.970 --> 01:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
and 25 is increasing for the same
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
reasons of salary step increases and
 
01:39:58.199 --> 01:39:59.450 align:start position:0%
reasons of salary step increases and
benefits

01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
and then increases in cost to support
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
so on page 10 is the division of
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement this includes enforcement
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
licensing education and grants the
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
division is responsible for enforcing
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
alcoholic beverage laws enforcing youth
 
01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
access to tobacco and providing
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
licensing education and support for over
 
01:40:26.930 --> 01:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
6 100 licensees
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
in FY 22 the division collected over 19
 
01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
million in Revenue
 
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
in fy24 the but their budget is
 
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
decreasing 6.6 percent and this is due
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
to changes in positions as a result of
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
turnover and then there increases for
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
so then on page 11 you have the division
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
of an Administration this includes doit
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
HR and finance and included in finance
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
is audit uh inventory control and legal
 
01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
all of these departments Provide support
 
01:41:06.590 --> 01:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
to all the other departments within the
 
01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:08.390 align:start position:0%
to all the other departments within the
commission

01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:41:12.890 --> 01:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
the fy24 increase of 20 or 1.7 million
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
is primarily for the additional
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs for doit along with
 
01:41:20.209 --> 01:41:20.219 align:start position:0%
adding an allocation for indirect costs
 
01:41:22.729 --> 01:41:22.739 align:start position:0%
and then the two new positions that I
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned
 
01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
and then fy25 is also for salary steps
 
01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.330 --> 01:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
on page 12 is the division of marketing
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
and Merchandising this includes
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
marketing merchandising advertising our
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
retail store outlets and the
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
headquarters Warehouse
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
the division oversees the buying pricing
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
marketing selling and distributing of
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
products throughout all our channels to
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
promote sales and maximize profits
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
fy24 increase of 5.2 percent or 3.5
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
million is in large part for the
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
increase in the technology hardware and
 
01:42:05.689 --> 01:42:05.699 align:start position:0%
software for the additional prioritized
 
01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
needs to support the next gen system and
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
for continuing operations for contracts
 
01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
rent equipment supplies and utilities
 
01:42:21.050 --> 01:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
and then the fy25 3.9 or 2.7 million
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
increase is mainly for the salary steps
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
and benefits and the cost of doing
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
business in areas such as increases in
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
our metal store shelving supplies
 
01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then on page 13 is workers comp and
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
unemployment comp
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
workers comp and FY 23 is actually
 
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
underfunded and the increase in FY 24 is
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
based on the historical Trend the
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
increase is because as we continue to be
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
understaffed and ask more of our
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
employees we are seeing a higher amount
 
01:43:02.450 --> 01:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
of claims
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
and at this point I will turn it back
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
over to the chairman
 
01:43:09.169 --> 01:43:09.179 align:start position:0%
thanks Tina
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
so just quickly uh on page 14
 
01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
establishing a retail employee incentive
 
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
you'll just turn your attention to
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph three four and five uh this is
 
01:43:28.129 --> 01:43:28.139 align:start position:0%
something that is has been adopted has
 
01:43:29.930 --> 01:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
been through jail car the rules are done
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's something that my I put into action
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
in 2011 with Governor Lynch it's
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
something that we've never used at The
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission but we've had it
 
01:43:42.129 --> 01:43:42.139 align:start position:0%
available to us since 2011.
 
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
given the circumstances that we're under
 
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
basically the the paid disparaging
 
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
between what we're seeing on the outside
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
in business and what the state is paying
 
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
we felt that it's now time to put it
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
into action
 
01:44:04.729 --> 01:44:04.739 align:start position:0%
it'll be broken down uh by the seven
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
areas that the supervisors seven
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
supervisor areas
 
01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:13.139 align:start position:0%
the employees will be allowed to gain an
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
incentive based on additional sales so
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is something that we've worked
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
closely with the governor's office I had
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
three or four different variations of
 
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
how this was done
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
the governor was very supportive of this
 
01:44:28.970 --> 01:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
piece because it allows the employees to
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
Garner some additional rev wages while
 
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
the commission Garners some additional
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue one of the uh a couple of the
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
caveats with it uh our average part-time
 
01:44:44.530 --> 01:44:44.540 align:start position:0%
employee now works about 15 hours a week
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
this will require anybody that's
 
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
involved in this program to work at
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
least 21 hours a week as you'll see in
 
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph five
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
obviously our goal is to see part-timers
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
that have various jobs not only with us
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
but with other outside businesses to
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
come work for us for an additional day
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
or two and then be able to take part in
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
and then on page 15 you'll see that the
 
01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:18.950 align:start position:0%
and then on page 15 you'll see that the
uh

01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
the language and italics that will be
 
01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
added basically what we're asking for is
 
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
for this to be paid from the additional
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
sales that take place at the commission
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
give us the ability to pay the res the
 
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
incentive program based on the
 
01:45:39.609 --> 01:45:39.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
and on page 16 this is to establish an
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
independent retail outlet pay scale for
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
an employee program basically what we're
 
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
seeing is just you know it's
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
every businessman
 
01:45:57.169 --> 01:45:57.179 align:start position:0%
that's successful and worth his salt
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
quite frankly has allowed their
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
employees to take part in some sort of
 
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
arrays as they move through covet and
 
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
into the post-covet operations of
 
01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:11.990 align:start position:0%
into the post-covet operations of
business

01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're clearly below what other
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
retailers are paying and that you'll see
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
the language on page 18 and 19.
 
01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh as I said we weren't able to expand
 
01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
our summer hours we weren't able to
 
01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
expand our holiday hours we're certain
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
that we'll be able to increase sales to
 
01:46:34.609 --> 01:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
cover these
 
01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh additional expenses we don't know
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
what that will look like yet as far as
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents are concerned uh in
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
addition to the incentive program but
 
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
it's something that we certainly think
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
that we need to look at
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
as I said the language for that is on
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
page 19 and both of these
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
have been brought forth in hb2 now this
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
is not for the headquarters employees
 
01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
it's not for enforced and it's not for
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
marketing or warehousing it's just for
 
01:47:11.209 --> 01:47:11.219 align:start position:0%
the retail employees in our stores and
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
obviously that's where the rubber hits
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
the road retail equals Revenue
 
01:47:18.590 --> 01:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
and you'll notice on the last page on
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
page 20 as a summary source that was in
 
01:47:24.729 --> 01:47:24.739 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire news
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
the rates of pay around the state the
 
01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
medium hours and the goal of any
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
retailer is to track consumers to the
 
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
brand it's to offer competitive prices
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's offer convenient locations
 
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh we feel that we've done all of that
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's to benefit our business by
 
01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
consumers having a longer shopping
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
experience in our stores
 
01:47:52.729 --> 01:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
which leads to higher basket ranks
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
which leads to Shorter checkout lines
 
01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
which leads to a positive experience and
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
we didn't answer any questions that you
 
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
a quick question
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I believe you mentioned here that a
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
part-time employee now is around 12 is
 
01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
it 1283 12 you know around that range
 
01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
where does it two-part question where
 
01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
does it need to be in order where you'll
 
01:48:27.890 --> 01:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
be confident that you can attract
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
employees and number two do you have uh
 
01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
even a a rough estimate on for every
 
01:48:38.330 --> 01:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
full-time employee that you have in the
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
liquor store is actually selling how
 
01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
much sales go up absolutely
 
01:48:46.930 --> 01:48:46.940 align:start position:0%
uh we feel that it needs to be
 
01:48:53.950 --> 01:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.370 --> 01:48:57.380 align:start position:0%
what a full-time employee brings in
 
01:49:01.010 --> 01:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
two sales is around around a million
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
dollars annually per employee
 
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh and that's historically we've tracked
 
01:49:09.770 --> 01:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
that data for years and that's it's
 
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
varied between 750
 
01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
000 and a million two
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
so we're pretty comfortable with the
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
Million number
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
per full-time employee
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
I have two questions
 
01:49:27.239 --> 01:49:29.510 align:start position:0%
I have two questions
um

01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:31.629 --> 01:49:31.639 align:start position:0%
first that number's about
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of orders of magnitude greater
 
01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
than I had any idea
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
um it makes a huge difference so we
 
01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.370 align:start position:0%
um it makes a huge difference so we
should

01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
we should pay them double and add 60.
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
um I imagine there's a curve at some
 
01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.270 align:start position:0%
um I imagine there's a curve at some
point

01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:49:49.129 --> 01:49:49.139 align:start position:0%
um one is the incentive program and I
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
read your your um your 800 rules and
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to describe the
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
incentive program to me but I don't
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
think I could understand it any better
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
than what I read in the rules but where
 
01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
are you going to pay that out of the
 
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
book class
 
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
well we were looking for the authority
 
01:50:10.129 --> 01:50:10.139 align:start position:0%
to be able to fund the incentive through
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
the profits so transferring money from
 
01:50:17.090 --> 01:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
the liquor fund to a class line it'll
 
01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
probably end up be like the class 10 or
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
like class 17 special pay
 
01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.010 align:start position:0%
like class 17 special pay
okay

01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay so it's not in the budget right now
 
01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
we're just asking now for the authority
 
01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
to be able to transfer the additional
 
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
profits to fund the incentive post so
 
01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's also not in your efficiency correct
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
and this would be paid functionally out
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
of gross correct okay
 
01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:44.699 align:start position:0%
um secondly my question about the
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
classification language this would have
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
to be bargained
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
for the incentive program no nothing I'm
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
sorry the removing the retail employees
 
01:50:57.370 --> 01:50:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:00.290 --> 01:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
I would imagine yes that it would be
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
have you had preliminary discussions
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
with the sea not at this point
 
01:51:08.209 --> 01:51:08.219 align:start position:0%
we've uh we've had many many discussions
 
01:51:08.219 --> 01:51:09.189 align:start position:0%
we've uh we've had many many discussions
about

01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:51:13.129 --> 01:51:13.139 align:start position:0%
about the the bay itself
 
01:51:15.410 --> 01:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
but not about the the language that
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:22.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:25.850 --> 01:51:25.860 align:start position:0%
two questions one um on the proposal for
 
01:51:27.590 --> 01:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
the retail is that part-time and
 
01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:28.910 align:start position:0%
the retail is that part-time and
full-time

01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
or just your or part-time workers for
 
01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
the incentive program no sorry for the
 
01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:35.090 align:start position:0%
the incentive program no sorry for the
um

01:51:35.090 --> 01:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
correct for a proposal of a new pay
 
01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:39.669 align:start position:0%
correct for a proposal of a new pay
scale

01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
full-time and part-time and I don't know
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
if you happen to have these numbers but
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
on average what is your Workforce split
 
01:51:48.169 --> 01:51:48.179 align:start position:0%
at your retail is it mostly part-time
 
01:51:49.970 --> 01:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
mostly full-time
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
is it depend on the store
 
01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
it depends on the store but right now
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
we're at we have about uh 600 part-time
 
01:52:02.209 --> 01:52:02.219 align:start position:0%
employees and about 230 full-time
 
01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
employees that's for the whole
 
01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
commission and as I've said uh we're
 
01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
down about a hundred part-time employees
 
01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
and uh we're down about 40 full-time
 
01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:14.270 align:start position:0%
and uh we're down about 40 full-time
employees

01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
but we've also noticed the termination
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
rate being using the terminology
 
01:52:20.689 --> 01:52:20.699 align:start position:0%
termination rate being that people that
 
01:52:23.689 --> 01:52:23.699 align:start position:0%
have left the commission voluntarily uh
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
over over the past four years has nearly
 
01:52:30.169 --> 01:52:30.179 align:start position:0%
doubled so we're losing employees double
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
the rate we were four years ago simply
 
01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
because we're not paying employees
 
01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:36.229 align:start position:0%
because we're not paying employees
enough

01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I I can't stress enough and
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
in business uh
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
that time that consumers spend in the
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
store with an educated employee to
 
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
basket build shop and spend more is
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
imperative to what we do
 
01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh Total Wine who operates seven stores
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and who's the largest
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
Wine and Spirits retailer in the country
 
01:53:10.609 --> 01:53:10.619 align:start position:0%
operates in 46 states around 260 stores
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
um we average about six to six full-time
 
01:53:18.169 --> 01:53:18.179 align:start position:0%
employees in a 20 000 square foot store
 
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
they average between 18 and 22 full-time
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.290 --> 01:53:32.300 align:start position:0%
so we're clearly lacking there and
 
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
previously the the initiative was to run
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
the stores more with part-timers because
 
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
of the benefits but now we're seeing
 
01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
because we can't entice the part-timers
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's why we're asking for the 24
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
additional retail employees to see if we
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
can get more people into the stores
 
01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:51.970 align:start position:0%
can get more people into the stores
working

01:53:51.970 --> 01:53:51.980 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
legislatively that was something that
 
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
was done years ago the legislature
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
wanted the Liquor Commission to run that
 
01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
way and the Liquor Commission did uh
 
01:54:04.609 --> 01:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
you know different times
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
require different attitudes toward
 
01:54:06.719 --> 01:54:08.570 align:start position:0%
require different attitudes toward
business

01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
do you find your your uh terminations I
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
know I know that's the wrong term
 
01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
um for the public but people leaving
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
employment are disproportionately
 
01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:18.950 align:start position:0%
employment are disproportionately
part-time

01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
and so you have a better success with
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
full-time we certainly do
 
01:54:27.169 --> 01:54:27.179 align:start position:0%
and what we're seeing now sort of crew
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
of all of us I think it is what we're
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
seeing now is a lot of employees being
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
hired into those full-time positions are
 
01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
from outside State service so we see a a
 
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
quite a few people from other retail
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
outlets and other retail structures
 
01:54:46.729 --> 01:54:46.739 align:start position:0%
coming to work for the Commission in
 
01:54:49.129 --> 01:54:49.139 align:start position:0%
those full-time positions because
 
01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
obviously the pay is is is equal to but
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
it's the benefits and that's that's what
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're seeing and and that's something in
 
01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
my 13 years with the commission this is
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
really the the last 365 days we've
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
noticed it
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
I sort of get that I'm here because of
 
01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
the benefits too
 
01:55:15.169 --> 01:55:15.179 align:start position:0%
um my last point would be just a on page
 
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
five a terminology thought

want to congratulate you for shuffling
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
this day through the covid pandemic uh
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
having the state's unemployment rate in
 
02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
in March of 2020 go from roughly two
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
percent up to 16 percent
 
02:02:50.649 --> 02:02:50.659 align:start position:0%
uh certainly was a jolt and it's been
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
obviously uh volatile over the last few
 
02:02:56.570 --> 02:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
years but uh in the governor's opening
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
remarks he mentioned about the certainly
 
02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
the the possibility not probability of
 
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
an oncoming recession
 
02:03:05.689 --> 02:03:05.699 align:start position:0%
how well it might seem like if our
 
02:03:07.729 --> 02:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
employment now goes from 2.2 percent up
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
to six percent you're probably very uh
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
capable of being able to handle
 
02:03:13.550 --> 02:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
something like that but you just talk
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
about your uh what position you're in to
 
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
be able to handle a either a moderate
 
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
recession or a deep recession that might
 
02:03:25.250 --> 02:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.770 --> 02:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so
 
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
um some very important Lessons Learned
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh during the pandemic
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and our ability to to Pivot very
 
02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
quickly not only on an increase in
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
volume like we experienced seemingly
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
overnight but also in how we deliver
 
02:03:43.010 --> 02:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
those Services which I think is even
 
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
more important
 
02:03:46.850 --> 02:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
um so so our staff demonstrated great
 
02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
um so so our staff demonstrated great
skill

02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
skill
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
um and willingness to take on additional
 
02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:51.589 align:start position:0%
um and willingness to take on additional
tasks

02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
tasks
 
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
um in additional hours during the
 
02:03:55.850 --> 02:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
pandemic but one of a few of the things
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:03:59.209 --> 02:03:59.219 align:start position:0%
um have pivoted and how we deliver
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
services that would be very important
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we encounter next in
 
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
terms of what fuels any
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
um economic downturn that we may
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
experience in an increase in
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment claim volume but now we are
 
02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
are much more agile in being able to
 
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
deliver our services virtually which is
 
02:04:19.609 --> 02:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
very important um allowing people more
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility in their desire whether to
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
come into a local office to seek
 
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
services I also were able to do our
 
02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
one-on-one services our Workshop
 
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
Services those are all able to be
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
delivered uh virtually
 
02:04:36.410 --> 02:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
um really um at the turn of the switch
 
02:04:38.089 --> 02:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
um with with our system
 
02:04:41.089 --> 02:04:41.099 align:start position:0%
um and we have the ability to
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
um take on uh more questions over our
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
hotline and the ability to transition
 
02:04:50.209 --> 02:04:50.219 align:start position:0%
that service from something that right
 
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
now is very localized so that if you
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
were in the Manchester area or you're
 
02:04:55.490 --> 02:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
calling in you're going to get an
 
02:04:56.689 --> 02:04:56.699 align:start position:0%
individual that's sitting in the
 
02:04:58.609 --> 02:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
Manchester office
 
02:05:00.649 --> 02:05:00.659 align:start position:0%
um what we would what we did during the
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic was all of those calls coming
 
02:05:05.169 --> 02:05:05.179 align:start position:0%
in they go to the the the
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
agent that is available regardless of
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
where they sit in the state so we made
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
some adjustments
 
02:05:14.810 --> 02:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
um obviously hopefully we continue to
 
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
hope that we do not experience any sort
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
of downturn but knowing that things are
 
02:05:23.890 --> 02:05:23.900 align:start position:0%
cyclical we prepare for that we do have
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
a temporary a full-time positions for
 
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
which we would feel as needed the
 
02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
dollars to support those would be an
 
02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
additional above base Federal funding if
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
we need those positions but again I
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
think we learned a lot of important
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
lessons during the pandemic on how we
 
02:05:47.050 --> 02:05:47.060 align:start position:0%
can pivot quickly and how we can rely
 
02:05:50.810 --> 02:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
very heavily upon both our our system
 
02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
and the technology that we have and the
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
the enhancements that we've made to that
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
system but what our staff of our staff
 
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:03.490 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:06:03.490 --> 02:06:03.500 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
you have a small amount of money well
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
not that small but
 
02:06:09.649 --> 02:06:09.659 align:start position:0%
um overall uh transferred from other
 
02:06:09.659 --> 02:06:11.450 align:start position:0%
um overall uh transferred from other
agencies

02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:06:15.229 --> 02:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
what's the source of most of that
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
what are you billing people for so to
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
speak um so the U.S Department of Labor
 
02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
requires we have Partners within our
 
02:06:28.250 --> 02:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
One-Stop centers throughout the state
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
and so they share in the cost of the
 
02:06:33.790 --> 02:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
operation of those centers
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
so that would be the revenue received
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
from those other partner agencies for
 
02:06:42.050 --> 02:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
residing in our offices for their
 
02:06:43.609 --> 02:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
presence no I didn't realize there were
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
that many of them
 
02:06:47.689 --> 02:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
I guess there are
 
02:06:50.930 --> 02:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
that many of what Joe that many offices
 
02:06:57.229 --> 02:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
you mean well no that many I I thought
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much for your
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take a uh three minute
 
02:07:18.169 --> 02:07:18.179 align:start position:0%
break and then we'll be back with the
 
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:19.560 align:start position:0%

thousands of people who are licensed

of the fertilizers again which is
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
something that people have wanted but we
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%

regulated by that that division we
 
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
recently just had a very large
 
02:14:22.030 --> 02:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
settlement with a Oil Dealer whose
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
trucks were not delivering that which
 
02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to and in that case
 
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
rather than heavily find that company we
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
chose to pursue a settlement that'll
 
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
that required them to provide

don't have
 
02:15:16.850 --> 02:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
any worse
 
02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
problems with invasives in this state
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
than than we already do but that is in
 
02:15:24.169 --> 02:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
some cases unfortunately a losing battle
 
02:15:26.209 --> 02:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
when the within the commissioner's
 
02:15:26.219 --> 02:15:27.709 align:start position:0%
when the within the commissioner's
office

02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:15:27.719 --> 02:15:28.669 align:start position:0%
office
um

02:15:28.669 --> 02:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:32.089 --> 02:15:32.099 align:start position:0%
as myself Michelle Tebow who is the
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant and an
 
02:15:33.599 --> 02:15:34.729 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant and an
accountant

02:15:34.729 --> 02:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
accountant
 
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
so the commissioner's office is three
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
people although we did take
 
02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:41.510 align:start position:0%
people although we did take
um

02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:43.370 --> 02:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
Services a number of years ago the food
 
02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
safety modernization act into the office
 
02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
and that is directly under the
 
02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:53.270 align:start position:0%
and that is directly under the
commissioner

02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:15:57.050 --> 02:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
so I I am responsible for that that
 
02:15:57.060 --> 02:15:59.270 align:start position:0%
so I I am responsible for that that
program

02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:00.290 align:start position:0%
program
um

02:16:00.290 --> 02:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:03.890 --> 02:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
we have 42 authorized positions at the
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
current time one of those is a fully
 
02:16:10.810 --> 02:16:10.820 align:start position:0%
Federal refunded position uh in plant
 
02:16:14.450 --> 02:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
plant industry there are four four
 
02:16:18.490 --> 02:16:18.500 align:start position:0%
part-time positions one of which is the
 
02:16:20.450 --> 02:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
executive director of the state
 
02:16:22.669 --> 02:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission which just began
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago after having no
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
staff there
 
02:16:28.810 --> 02:16:28.820 align:start position:0%
or contractor for
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
several years
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
in this year's budget request
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
we are requesting a an assistant
 
02:16:37.559 --> 02:16:39.169 align:start position:0%
we are requesting a an assistant
commissioner

02:16:39.169 --> 02:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:16:41.690 --> 02:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
in the in the office
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and I that has been a priority of
 
02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:45.969 align:start position:0%
um and I that has been a priority of
mine

02:16:45.969 --> 02:16:45.979 align:start position:0%
mine
 
02:16:48.290 --> 02:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
since I became commissioner soon
 
02:16:50.450 --> 02:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
realizing that um
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
was really impossible to do everything
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
that was required of the commissioner
 
02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
without an assistant but covet got in
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
the way and other things became a higher
 
02:16:59.399 --> 02:17:00.770 align:start position:0%
the way and other things became a higher
priority

02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
priority
 
02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh and so we are making that request
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
once again I do have a deputy but he's
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
the state veterinarian who is busier
 
02:17:11.570 --> 02:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
than I am and really only acts it in my
 
02:17:13.610 --> 02:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
absence which is
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh very infrequent
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
much to my wife's children but um
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
we have also asked that the state
 
02:17:25.310 --> 02:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
executive director of State Conservation
 
02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:26.509 align:start position:0%
executive director of State Conservation
Commission

02:17:26.509 --> 02:17:26.519 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:17:29.290 --> 02:17:29.300 align:start position:0%
be upgraded to a full-time position
 
02:17:33.709 --> 02:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
State Conservation Commission is a
 
02:17:36.009 --> 02:17:36.019 align:start position:0%
something that exists in all 50 states
 
02:17:38.990 --> 02:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's this program that's about 75 years
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
old the state is broken by County into
 
02:17:44.570 --> 02:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
districts that have supervisors that
 
02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
manage it there has been a real lack of
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
coordination for probably 10 or 12 years
 
02:17:54.290 --> 02:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
which does not allow us to efficiently
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
use the resources that exist within the
 
02:17:58.730 --> 02:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
10 counties because there's nobody there
 
02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
even knowing what's going on we have
 
02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:04.019 align:start position:0%
found that having someone there even
 
02:18:07.009 --> 02:18:07.019 align:start position:0%
part-time has been a great asset to the
 
02:18:09.310 --> 02:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
state and really beginning to make
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
once again the system much more
 
02:18:16.009 --> 02:18:16.019 align:start position:0%
beneficial and of course the state
 
02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
conservation deals with Farmland what
 
02:18:22.129 --> 02:18:22.139 align:start position:0%
we're really pushing these days is no
 
02:18:22.139 --> 02:18:23.089 align:start position:0%
we're really pushing these days is no
till

02:18:23.089 --> 02:18:23.099 align:start position:0%
till
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
soil erosion is mitigated by that it
 
02:18:29.810 --> 02:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
also sequesters carbon into the soil
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
which is helping with with climate you
 
02:18:33.889 --> 02:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
know State like New Hampshire we can't
 
02:18:36.589 --> 02:18:36.599 align:start position:0%
do much but we need to do what we can so
 
02:18:39.290 --> 02:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
this is a very important position for us
 
02:18:41.330 --> 02:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
to go from part-time to full-time
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
obviously to keep somebody in that
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
position requires a full-time job and
 
02:18:49.610 --> 02:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
requires benefits and we've got a a
 
02:18:52.370 --> 02:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
great individual there who is supported
 
02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:55.519 align:start position:0%
by everyone within the system last year
 
02:18:59.810 --> 02:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
the legislature created an invasive
 
02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:02.150 align:start position:0%
the legislature created an invasive
species

02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
species
 
02:19:04.730 --> 02:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
position but didn't fund it
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
and they put money into that so that we
 
02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
can start to really do a better job of
 
02:19:13.370 --> 02:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
coordinating with the invasive species
 
02:19:16.310 --> 02:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
you see not weed probably everywhere you
 
02:19:20.209 --> 02:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
see the um which is the Japanese knot
 
02:19:23.570 --> 02:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm always losing what it is that
 
02:19:28.969 --> 02:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
wraps it throughout itself around the
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
trees everywhere something very and for
 
02:19:34.429 --> 02:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
some reason it's it's escaped my mind
 
02:19:36.889 --> 02:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
again we're losing the state to that if
 
02:19:38.929 --> 02:19:38.939 align:start position:0%
you've ever been down near Hartford you
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
might think you're in a jungle because
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
they've lost that battle where we
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
haven't lost it yet but if we don't
 
02:19:46.969 --> 02:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
really start to put some serious effort
 
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
into that and coordinate with Dot and
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
with the towns and give them the support
 
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
on how to manage these things we will
 
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
solely soon be looking like like other
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
states in that area but I always use
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hartford as as the example of how bad it
 
02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
can get and literally
 
02:20:04.020 --> 02:20:04.969 align:start position:0%
can get and literally
um

02:20:04.969 --> 02:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:07.490 --> 02:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
trees can be killed with
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
with these things so we're hopeful that
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
your Governor is supportive of of that
 
02:20:16.370 --> 02:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
um so those are really the two new
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
positions that we are requesting but one
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
was the legislature put it into the law
 
02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
but didn't fund it
 
02:20:23.220 --> 02:20:23.810 align:start position:0%
but didn't fund it
um

02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
and one upgrade
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
in the position for the Department
 
02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:29.870 align:start position:0%
in the position for the Department
um

02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
if you if you look on the first sheet
 
02:20:36.170 --> 02:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
of our
 
02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
budget hearing you'll see that while we
 
02:20:39.660 --> 02:20:40.490 align:start position:0%
budget hearing you'll see that while we
have

02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:42.590 align:start position:0%
have
um

02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:45.889 --> 02:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
we really do not require General funding
 
02:20:49.969 --> 02:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
in in total but of course we do but we'd
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
return more every year to the to the
 
02:20:55.490 --> 02:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
general fund so we are not a drag on the
 
02:20:58.250 --> 02:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
general fund we are a net positive to
 
02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
the general fund each year uh 2021
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
obviously was our low Point as we're
 
02:21:07.130 --> 02:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
moving forward we are expecting that in
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
in this year we'll return over
 
02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:11.050 align:start position:0%
in this year we'll return over
um

02:21:11.050 --> 02:21:11.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
670 000 to the general fund from the
 
02:21:16.849 --> 02:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
revenues that we get in
 
02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
in this proposed budget for 24.25
 
02:21:23.809 --> 02:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
in total nearly 1.5 million for the
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
two-year period you will see that our
 
02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
our budget numbers have increased
 
02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
relatively substantially a lot of that
 
02:21:35.929 --> 02:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
is due to the fact that we have two
 
02:21:37.969 --> 02:21:37.979 align:start position:0%
revolving funds within the department
 
02:21:40.450 --> 02:21:40.460 align:start position:0%
and during the pandemic
 
02:21:44.690 --> 02:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
my choice was to draw those funds down
 
02:21:46.969 --> 02:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
rather than lay off people because of
 
02:21:50.349 --> 02:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
the important work that we have to do
 
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
and so some of that is a reflection of
 
02:21:55.849 --> 02:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
the fact that at the time I said this
 
02:21:57.469 --> 02:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
was not sustainable that if we continue
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
to draw down we would we would empty
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
those funds and not be able to do what
 
02:22:04.670 --> 02:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing we didn't purchase uh
 
02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
vehicles our Fleet is about 24 vehicles
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
and we did not buy vehicles during that
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
time we need to get back on our
 
02:22:14.809 --> 02:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
replacement schedule
 
02:22:14.819 --> 02:22:16.210 align:start position:0%
replacement schedule
um

02:22:16.210 --> 02:22:16.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
but again you know while the numbers
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
the reality is that we will still return
 
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
money to the to the general fund when
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
all is said and done and
 
02:22:31.490 --> 02:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
from there I I could ramble on for
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
another half an hour but uh I'd be glad
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
that you have or if I can't turn them
 
02:22:39.770 --> 02:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
over to Michelle and see if she can do
 
02:22:41.809 --> 02:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
better than I can
 
02:22:44.510 --> 02:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the presentation
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
um could you just talk you have a you
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
have a a relatively small number of
 
02:22:52.969 --> 02:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
employees uh other agencies have
 
02:22:56.330 --> 02:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
a fairly significant vacancy rates you
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
know averaging around 20 percent
 
02:23:02.330 --> 02:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
what's yours and have you found it uh
 
02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
difficult to hire employees for your
 
02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
agency and you could just expand on that
 
02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
02:23:11.570 --> 02:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
so when I became commissioner we had a
 
02:23:13.370 --> 02:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
fairly High vacancy rate and there was
 
02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
no attempt to fill those
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I eventually discovered what the
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
reasoning was on that but we've since
 
02:23:22.610 --> 02:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
since corrected that it was an
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
overestimation of revenues in an order
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
to make everything work we left
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
positions vacant
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
right now I have four vacancies one is a
 
02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
new position which we just interviewed
 
02:23:37.010 --> 02:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
you for that's in fisma which is a
 
02:23:39.290 --> 02:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
hundred percent federally funded that
 
02:23:40.670 --> 02:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
whole program
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
um is funded by feds and will end if
 
02:23:45.530 --> 02:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
they stop funding it there was a
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
full-time position there when we took it
 
02:23:50.450 --> 02:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
over from HHS but none of us could
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
really figure out why and it's a program
 
02:23:55.370 --> 02:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
that ratchets up based on or ratchets
 
02:23:57.650 --> 02:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
down in this case you start with Farms
 
02:23:59.809 --> 02:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
that have very high income and then it
 
02:24:02.090 --> 02:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
goes down each year to cover more and
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
more Farms we've gotten to the point
 
02:24:05.929 --> 02:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
where we need to uh to fill that so they
 
02:24:08.170 --> 02:24:08.180 align:start position:0%
interviewed on Friday for that position
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
and do have a candidate I think we had
 
02:24:14.450 --> 02:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
three qualified for that one and other
 
02:24:17.210 --> 02:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
than that what we have is a few people
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
who have retired or left for other
 
02:24:21.010 --> 02:24:21.020 align:start position:0%
opportunities I get
 
02:24:23.570 --> 02:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
for a very brief period of time I do get
 
02:24:24.889 --> 02:24:24.899 align:start position:0%
to 100 percent
 
02:24:27.050 --> 02:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
and in this in this case the reason
 
02:24:30.170 --> 02:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
there's actually still four is that two
 
02:24:32.210 --> 02:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
people within the department moved up
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
which is a you know from my opinion a
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
great thing all of those positions are
 
02:24:39.230 --> 02:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
advertised and we have found that we
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
have had no no trouble whatsoever
 
02:24:44.210 --> 02:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
filling our positions probably with one
 
02:24:47.210 --> 02:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
exception a while back but we've been
 
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
doing very well and uh expect to be back
 
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
up at 100 percent uh within the month
 
02:24:54.889 --> 02:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
and then we'll see if anybody else
 
02:25:01.330 --> 02:25:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
John just because your neighbors I'm
 
02:25:05.389 --> 02:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
going to say hi hi Michelle
 
02:25:05.399 --> 02:25:06.650 align:start position:0%
going to say hi hi Michelle
hi

02:25:06.650 --> 02:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
hi
 
02:25:09.050 --> 02:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
um and that's about it so
 
02:25:13.130 --> 02:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
um plant industry is housed at HHS over
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
with public health yes
 
02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
um it's a dumb question but why
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
well I never asked I I don't know
 
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
because that's what my lab is I guess
 
02:25:25.010 --> 02:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
they have a lab over there they have
 
02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
they have an incredible collection of
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
insects over there and probably I'll
 
02:25:31.730 --> 02:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
take your word for that probably because
 
02:25:33.230 --> 02:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
there wasn't room over here when they
 
02:25:35.809 --> 02:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
moved the department is has moved a
 
02:25:37.849 --> 02:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
number of a number of times over the
 
02:25:40.849 --> 02:25:40.859 align:start position:0%
years and I think they've been I was
 
02:25:42.530 --> 02:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
there for a long time but of all the
 
02:25:44.090 --> 02:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
questions I've thought to ask that's not
 
02:25:47.929 --> 02:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:47.939 --> 02:25:49.130 align:start position:0%
 
morning

02:25:49.130 --> 02:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:25:51.650 --> 02:25:51.660 align:start position:0%
um this is on your prioritized needs
 
02:25:53.330 --> 02:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
um looks like there's about a million
 
02:25:55.250 --> 02:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
give or take in prioritized needs it's
 
02:25:57.290 --> 02:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
100 generally funded
 
02:25:59.270 --> 02:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned uh you know a few
 
02:26:01.250 --> 02:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
positions what's the other maybe is
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
there a big chunk that's somewhere else
 
02:26:04.429 --> 02:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
or is it just a lot of little things
 
02:26:07.849 --> 02:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
that make that up Michelle a lot of our
 
02:26:12.170 --> 02:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh prioritize beans are based on like uh
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
transfers to oit transverse General
 
02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:17.150 align:start position:0%
transfers to oit transverse General
services

02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:17.809 align:start position:0%
services
um

02:26:17.809 --> 02:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:20.330 --> 02:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
and instead of
 
02:26:22.610 --> 02:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
dividing that fund out of all the
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
general funds we've just all lumped it
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
into the commissioner's budget instead
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
of breaking it out
 
02:26:33.710 --> 02:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
and I should have touched on on it this
 
02:26:36.290 --> 02:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
year for the first time we do have a
 
02:26:39.770 --> 02:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
embedded I.T person which is very
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
helpful my joke has been that before I
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
leave as commissioner I'd like to to get
 
02:26:48.830 --> 02:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
us into the 1990s with our technology of
 
02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
course given what's going on right now I
 
02:26:52.010 --> 02:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
might not
 
02:26:56.330 --> 02:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
see that goal to fruition we are we do
 
02:26:59.809 --> 02:26:59.819 align:start position:0%
have one that is going out to bit
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
shortly on the animal
 
02:27:04.250 --> 02:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
database which is very important
 
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we had a huge setback in
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
weights and measures a contract was
 
02:27:10.910 --> 02:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
awarded prior to my becoming
 
02:27:13.309 --> 02:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner and just a couple of months
 
02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
ago we all came to the realization that
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to fulfill their
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
contract so we're still operating on a
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
system that was developed by a prisoner
 
02:27:27.650 --> 02:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire state prison and we
 
02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
did find somebody who was able to
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
maintain that because it was crashing so
 
02:27:33.170 --> 02:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
we've got to start over again do
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there will be a bill in
 
02:27:38.270 --> 02:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature that will be looking to
 
02:27:41.090 --> 02:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
fund RIT needs to get the other programs
 
02:27:43.210 --> 02:27:43.220 align:start position:0%
done we're developing the current one
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
with the idea that they would be able to
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
actually build off of the animal
 
02:27:52.730 --> 02:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
database probably everything except for
 
02:27:59.270 --> 02:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:01.730 --> 02:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
to Sherry's point one of your one of
 
02:28:03.770 --> 02:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
your prioritized needs is a 250 000
 
02:28:06.770 --> 02:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the office of the commissioner
 
02:28:11.570 --> 02:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
something about state fairs the state oh
 
02:28:13.610 --> 02:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
the state the state fair program this
 
02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
this last year
 
02:28:18.530 --> 02:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
um representative Ladd put forth a uh a
 
02:28:20.450 --> 02:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
bill to fund
 
02:28:24.010 --> 02:28:24.020 align:start position:0%
um infrastructure at at our state fairs
 
02:28:27.050 --> 02:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
and this would be the idea when he had
 
02:28:28.730 --> 02:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
put it in was going to be that it would
 
02:28:31.370 --> 02:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
be a yearly appropriation
 
02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
um and that ended up being a one-time
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
fund and so we've asked to continue that
 
02:28:39.770 --> 02:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh program some of our state fairs are
 
02:28:42.889 --> 02:28:42.899 align:start position:0%
in desperate need of of infrastructure
 
02:28:45.290 --> 02:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
upgrades and are having a difficult time
 
02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
because of course if we could guarantee
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
that the weather would be good every
 
02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
year we wouldn't be looking for this but
 
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes the
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
weather or pandemics can really do a
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
number on the fairs they're a critical
 
02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
part of of who we are as New Hampshire
 
02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
um and as some of you may know
 
02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
um the state fair has got a lot more
 
02:29:08.510 --> 02:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
money than what we're proposing back as
 
02:29:12.530 --> 02:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
late as 1980 because they were funded
 
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
um for premiums primarily but it freed
 
02:29:18.050 --> 02:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
up a lot of money by um a quarter
 
02:29:20.270 --> 02:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
percent of the total take at Rockingham
 
02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:21.309 align:start position:0%
percent of the total take at Rockingham
Park

02:29:21.309 --> 02:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
Park
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that was a program that went on from
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
the 1940s it's pretty much the walking
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
hand closed
 
02:29:29.570 --> 02:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna say that takes a lot
 
02:29:31.849 --> 02:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
lower than it used to be
 
02:29:36.110 --> 02:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
um you also have a 350 000 uh grants and
 
02:29:38.090 --> 02:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
grants Improvement is where I noticed
 
02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:38.870 align:start position:0%
grants Improvement is where I noticed
the

02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh prioritize need
 
02:29:43.309 --> 02:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
and I've not yet discovered which
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
division it's okay
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you recall what that is off
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
it just looked like maybe it was a
 
02:29:58.920 --> 02:29:59.929 align:start position:0%
it just looked like maybe it was a
program

02:29:59.929 --> 02:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:29:59.939 --> 02:30:04.429 align:start position:0%
program
probably

02:30:04.429 --> 02:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:06.650 --> 02:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:08.889 align:start position:0%
that the
um

02:30:08.889 --> 02:30:08.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.230 --> 02:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
Charlie what page are you on well I I
 
02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
saw it in the summary if I look at the
 
02:30:21.889 --> 02:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
first uh the beginning of the document
 
02:30:21.899 --> 02:30:22.730 align:start position:0%
first uh the beginning of the document
um

02:30:22.730 --> 02:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
the department roll up
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
shows 340 500 in additional prioritize
 
02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
needs both years
 
02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
for Grants and grants Administration
 
02:30:34.969 --> 02:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
and then I don't know exactly which
 
02:30:36.889 --> 02:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
which division it was in because I
 
02:30:44.690 --> 02:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
it may not be a big deal it might just
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
be the slump off of other things but
 
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
you don't know exactly where in the
 
02:30:55.309 --> 02:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
summer you're seeing no
 
02:30:59.270 --> 02:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:01.849 --> 02:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
fail you know what it's not anything
 
02:31:04.490 --> 02:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
that we need to figure out today we can
 
02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:05.510 align:start position:0%
that we need to figure out today we can
certainly

02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:31:08.210 --> 02:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
um yeah no rush
 
02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.720 --> 02:31:14.050 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:31:14.050 --> 02:31:14.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:31:16.250 --> 02:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
bottom of page six I just don't know
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
which division it is and I think I think
 
02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:35.210 --> 02:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:36.770 --> 02:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
that's probably I think it might under
 
02:31:40.130 --> 02:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
the animal industry oh okay
 
02:31:40.140 --> 02:31:42.410 align:start position:0%
the animal industry oh okay
um

02:31:42.410 --> 02:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:45.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:31:45.250 --> 02:31:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:49.370 --> 02:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah no rush I just thought I'd ask
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
no good question and obviously one we
 
02:31:59.630 --> 02:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:05.690 --> 02:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
I believe it is that
 
02:32:05.700 --> 02:32:06.349 align:start position:0%
I believe it is that
um

02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:08.030 --> 02:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
well that probably explains mostly and
 
02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
then I think it's got to do with the
 
02:32:13.130 --> 02:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
animal industry if you spot something
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
and no reason we need to do it today
 
02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:19.150 align:start position:0%
and no reason we need to do it today
foreign

02:32:19.150 --> 02:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:30.889 --> 02:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.809 --> 02:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
I like I see they're on their way
 
02:32:34.610 --> 02:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
banking Commission
 
02:32:36.170 --> 02:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you departments all right is on
 
02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:37.070 align:start position:0%
thank you departments all right is on
there

02:32:46.200 --> 02:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
good morning uh for the record my name
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
is Amelia galderi and I'm the bank
 
02:33:14.750 --> 02:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the State of New
 
02:33:16.330 --> 02:33:16.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with me is Michael
 
02:33:18.410 --> 02:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
jacksonowski he's the director of
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
operations for the banking Department
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to present
 
02:33:23.389 --> 02:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
our budget the banking Department's
 
02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
budget proposal today
 
02:33:27.650 --> 02:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh so I provide a handout
 
02:33:29.090 --> 02:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
um at the top of the handout you'll see
 
02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
the banking Department's mission
 
02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:31.490 align:start position:0%
the banking Department's mission
statement

02:33:31.490 --> 02:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
um the banking department is committed
 
02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
to protecting the Public's interests
 
02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
through the professional supervision of
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
the financial services it regulates
 
02:33:40.910 --> 02:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
um everything in our budget proposal is
 
02:33:42.410 --> 02:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
in support of that mission so I thought
 
02:33:44.330 --> 02:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
it was important to start with that
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
so um the banking department is
 
02:33:48.349 --> 02:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
organized into two divisions for the
 
02:33:50.090 --> 02:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
purposes of our budget
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
one is the Banking and Trust division in
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
that that division oversees the
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
activities of 17 State chartered Banks
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
nine State chartered credit unions and
 
02:34:02.330 --> 02:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
currently 41 non-depository trust
 
02:34:04.849 --> 02:34:04.859 align:start position:0%
companies and Family Trust companies
 
02:34:06.290 --> 02:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple in the hopper right
 
02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
now so by your end we expect that number
 
02:34:11.389 --> 02:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
to be perhaps one bigger
 
02:34:13.250 --> 02:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
um the second division is the consumer
 
02:34:15.710 --> 02:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
credit division that division oversees
 
02:34:18.410 --> 02:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
the uh several thousand Consumer Credit
 
02:34:20.690 --> 02:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
division licensees
 
02:34:22.849 --> 02:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
um so Mortgage Bankers Brokers small
 
02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
loan lenders money transmitters
 
02:34:27.170 --> 02:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
um several of those entities are what
 
02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
you what are commonly known as fintech
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
companies so companies that utilize
 
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
technology to provide financial services
 
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
and is a growing field
 
02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
um the banking within those two
 
02:34:40.730 --> 02:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
divisions the banking department has 48
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
positions which includes three vacant
 
02:34:45.830 --> 02:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
funded positions as well as three
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
positions that are actively being
 
02:34:50.210 --> 02:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
recruited to fill
 
02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
the banking department is a self-funded
 
02:34:52.319 --> 02:34:53.929 align:start position:0%
the banking department is a self-funded
agency

02:34:53.929 --> 02:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:34:53.939 --> 02:34:55.670 align:start position:0%
agency
um so

02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:34:57.530 --> 02:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
um a hundred percent of our funds are
 
02:34:59.090 --> 02:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
other funds
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
um every year we receive an
 
02:35:02.030 --> 02:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation and over the course of
 
02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
that year we collect fees fines and
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
finally an assessment and those monies
 
02:35:08.809 --> 02:35:08.819 align:start position:0%
are used to offset the initial
 
02:35:08.819 --> 02:35:10.790 align:start position:0%
are used to offset the initial
appropriation

02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
02:35:14.450 --> 02:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
uh moving on to our budget proposal
 
02:35:16.190 --> 02:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
um I've included some like high level
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
figures from our budget proposal
 
02:35:20.990 --> 02:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
um the key takeaway for our budget
 
02:35:23.090 --> 02:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
proposal is that our budget it is
 
02:35:25.010 --> 02:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
roughly probably a little bit more than
 
02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
this 80 percent
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
um salaries and benefits of our staff
 
02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:30.349 align:start position:0%
um salaries and benefits of our staff
plus

02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
plus
 
02:35:33.050 --> 02:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
um related expenses such as it support
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
for that staff and training expenses
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
um if you flip to the back of the
 
02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:41.090 align:start position:0%
um if you flip to the back of the
handout

02:35:41.090 --> 02:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
handout
 
02:35:42.889 --> 02:35:42.899 align:start position:0%
um you'll see that the banking
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
department has been tasked by the
 
02:35:46.490 --> 02:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
legislature with regulating a vibrant
 
02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
but ever growing number of licensed
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
entities cue back to the fintech
 
02:35:53.150 --> 02:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
companies I mentioned earlier and
 
02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
non-depository Trust companies and these
 
02:35:58.849 --> 02:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
numbers sort of reflect that kind of
 
02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
exponential growth we've been
 
02:36:00.120 --> 02:36:01.429 align:start position:0%
exponential growth we've been
experiencing

02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
02:36:03.530 --> 02:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
in past budget Cycles we've been able to
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
absorb this growth by increasing
 
02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
efficient efficiencies by for example
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
leveraging information Technologies and
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
making good use of existing positions
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
however the industry growth is now
 
02:36:19.490 --> 02:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
starting to outpace those strategies and
 
02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
soon we'll have more exams to do than we
 
02:36:24.050 --> 02:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
have examiners to do them and you can
 
02:36:26.570 --> 02:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
see with the trust companies um the
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
director of trust supervision Nancy
 
02:36:29.809 --> 02:36:29.819 align:start position:0%
degler not projected those numbers out
 
02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
so you can get a feel for how that
 
02:36:34.130 --> 02:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
growth is happening
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
um for this reason in this budget we've
 
02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
made a targeted and strategic strategic
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
request for two new positions in fiscal
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
year 24 and three new positions in
 
02:36:47.889 --> 02:36:47.899 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25
 
02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
and then outside of the budget we plan
 
02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
to make use of those three vacant and
 
02:36:56.450 --> 02:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
funded positions we're going to do a
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
combination of reclassifications and
 
02:37:01.969 --> 02:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
re-allocations to make the best and
 
02:37:04.490 --> 02:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
highest use of those positions to help
 
02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
us cope with the enormous influx of
 
02:37:09.889 --> 02:37:09.899 align:start position:0%
licensed and chartered entities
 
02:37:09.899 --> 02:37:10.670 align:start position:0%
licensed and chartered entities
um

02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
so I think all of that hopefully
 
02:37:15.889 --> 02:37:15.899 align:start position:0%
accomplishes our goal
 
02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
um which is at the end of my hand out of
 
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
providing the banking Department with
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
adequate experienced and professional
 
02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:21.590 align:start position:0%
adequate experienced and professional
staff

02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
to cope with the extraordinary growth in
 
02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
the emergency emerging fintech companies
 
02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
and the exponential increase in the
 
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
number of trust companies supervised by
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
the department and
 
02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:33.170 align:start position:0%
the department and
um

02:37:33.170 --> 02:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:35.330 --> 02:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
because we're largely staff and that's
 
02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
most of our budget that's the extent of
 
02:37:38.929 --> 02:37:38.939 align:start position:0%
my presentation
 
02:37:40.370 --> 02:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:37:42.110 --> 02:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:43.490 align:start position:0%
you might have
sure

02:37:43.490 --> 02:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:44.210 align:start position:0%
sure
um

02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
first trusted admission I know extremely
 
02:37:48.889 --> 02:37:48.899 align:start position:0%
little about cryptocurrency
 
02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
however I I it appears I do know a lot
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
more than the people who have been
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
investing in cryptocurrency over the
 
02:37:56.330 --> 02:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
last few years
 
02:37:57.650 --> 02:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if you could explain
 
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
or just how you position to deal with
 
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency especially how it impacts
 
02:38:06.770 --> 02:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
Banking and banking regulations sure so
 
02:38:09.170 --> 02:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
um right now with the current news that
 
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're all hearing about FTX and
 
02:38:14.330 --> 02:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
um block five Voyager those have been
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
the names in the news of the um failing
 
02:38:19.010 --> 02:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
companies those entities are licensed
 
02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
with us to do a very small component of
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
their business which is money
 
02:38:24.889 --> 02:38:24.899 align:start position:0%
transmission so traditionally money
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
transmission is you think of Western
 
02:38:30.050 --> 02:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
Union they transfer money fiat currency
 
02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
back and forth between people
 
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
um these companies are licensed by the
 
02:38:38.750 --> 02:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
banking Department to take in either
 
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
people's cash or their crypto and then
 
02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:44.349 align:start position:0%
people's cash or their crypto and then
transmit

02:38:44.349 --> 02:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
transmit
 
02:38:47.389 --> 02:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
catch to other people if they're doing
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
business where they're taking in crypto
 
02:38:51.290 --> 02:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
and transmitting crypto the legislature
 
02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
accepted that from our jurisdiction
 
02:38:55.910 --> 02:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
so we really just regulate a small
 
02:38:55.920 --> 02:38:57.050 align:start position:0%
so we really just regulate a small
portion

02:38:57.050 --> 02:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
portion
 
02:38:59.090 --> 02:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
of what the companies that you're
 
02:39:00.830 --> 02:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
hearing about in the news do
 
02:39:02.450 --> 02:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
that said
 
02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
um there are other ways that entities
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
under our regulation could potentially
 
02:39:09.410 --> 02:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
interact with cryptocurrency
 
02:39:11.570 --> 02:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
um we have trust companies that could
 
02:39:14.570 --> 02:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
potentially be holding it in custody for
 
02:39:16.130 --> 02:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
their clients
 
02:39:18.889 --> 02:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's trying to think if
 
02:39:20.450 --> 02:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
there's any other ones that I've heard
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
of I think that's the bulk of what how
 
02:39:24.170 --> 02:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
we interact with cryptocurrency at the
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
banking Department and so this
 
02:39:31.370 --> 02:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
um part of the positions will go to the
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
consumer credit division which is really
 
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing and having to cope with all
 
02:39:38.929 --> 02:39:38.939 align:start position:0%
of this cryptocurrency
 
02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
information that is coming at them in
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
the news right now even though it is
 
02:39:42.479 --> 02:39:43.429 align:start position:0%
the news right now even though it is
just

02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:39:45.410 --> 02:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
small component of what these bigger
 
02:39:47.889 --> 02:39:47.899 align:start position:0%
companies do is what we regulate
 
02:39:50.210 --> 02:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh so okay thank you for that uh
 
02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
Switching gears I know you're
 
02:39:55.130 --> 02:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
maybe not uniquely qualified but you are
 
02:39:57.469 --> 02:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
certainly qualified to have a lot of
 
02:39:59.570 --> 02:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
your employees be able to work off-site
 
02:40:01.849 --> 02:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
and whether it's work from home or work
 
02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
in other locations
 
02:40:05.929 --> 02:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
where there's the space you're in now is
 
02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
that going to be a continued home and
 
02:40:09.710 --> 02:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
are you looking given your expense your
 
02:40:11.690 --> 02:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
plan to have people work from home
 
02:40:14.389 --> 02:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
please question if I'm wrong on that but
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
um whether there's been any sort of of
 
02:40:17.630 --> 02:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
downsizing that position or maybe
 
02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
changing up your position where you're
 
02:40:22.370 --> 02:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
located now yeah so we're actively
 
02:40:24.050 --> 02:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
looking at that issue right now our
 
02:40:26.330 --> 02:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
lease is up in May so we're currently
 
02:40:27.710 --> 02:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
kind of discussing with our current
 
02:40:29.330 --> 02:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
landlord whether our space can be
 
02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
reconfigured because if you were to walk
 
02:40:32.690 --> 02:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
into the banking Department right now we
 
02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:33.889 align:start position:0%
into the banking Department right now we
have

02:40:33.889 --> 02:40:33.899 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
um a cube Farm as we call it at the
 
02:40:37.610 --> 02:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
banking Department of cubicles that used
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
to be house examiners pre-pandemic but
 
02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
we've found that they can be completely
 
02:40:44.270 --> 02:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
in the field doing their examination so
 
02:40:45.710 --> 02:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
they maybe come into the office
 
02:40:47.690 --> 02:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
occasionally but certainly not the need
 
02:40:49.849 --> 02:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
for that cute Farm
 
02:40:51.349 --> 02:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
um so we're currently engaging with our
 
02:40:53.150 --> 02:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
landlord to try to reconfigure the space
 
02:40:55.130 --> 02:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
reduce the space
 
02:40:57.469 --> 02:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
um however it's taking a bit longer
 
02:40:59.270 --> 02:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
because of construction finding people
 
02:41:01.130 --> 02:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
to provide quotes for the construction
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:41:04.969 --> 02:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
problem right now I believe if my
 
02:41:06.830 --> 02:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
landlord was here to talk to you that's
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
what he would say so it's taking a
 
02:41:10.370 --> 02:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
little bit longer than we anticipate but
 
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
it is something we're actively looking
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
at because we have space that's
 
02:41:18.590 --> 02:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm good
 
02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:20.990 align:start position:0%
I'm good
hi

02:41:20.990 --> 02:41:21.000 align:start position:0%

02:41:50.330 --> 02:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:52.429 --> 02:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
good morning I need to hit the button
 
02:41:55.010 --> 02:41:55.020 align:start position:0%

02:42:09.710 --> 02:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna get my glasses out
 
02:42:11.809 --> 02:42:11.819 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:42:14.270 --> 02:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
um in this slideshow you'll see today we
 
02:42:16.370 --> 02:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
have some slides here that talk about
 
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
the veterans home and the history of
 
02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:19.309 align:start position:0%
the veterans home and the history of
this

02:42:19.309 --> 02:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:42:22.429 --> 02:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
um it has been around since 1890 I think
 
02:42:24.770 --> 02:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
it predates Charlie
 
02:42:28.670 --> 02:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and we are uh 250 bed long-term care
 
02:42:31.250 --> 02:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
facility no skilled care all long-term
 
02:42:34.969 --> 02:42:34.979 align:start position:0%
care we're currently funded by three
 
02:42:38.450 --> 02:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources the general fund the U.S
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Veteran Affairs and the
 
02:42:44.050 --> 02:42:44.060 align:start position:0%
residents themselves pay room on board
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh today we have a statutory capacity of
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
250 we are budgeted around 225
 
02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
um due to the covet situation and
 
02:42:56.990 --> 02:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing that we're all experiencing our
 
02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
current resident snapshot is 124
 
02:43:03.410 --> 02:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
residents we have seven more admissions
 
02:43:07.969 --> 02:43:07.979 align:start position:0%
coming uh over the next four weeks and
 
02:43:10.309 --> 02:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
our average age of a veteran is 84 years
 
02:43:10.319 --> 02:43:11.270 align:start position:0%
our average age of a veteran is 84 years
old

02:43:11.270 --> 02:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
old
 
02:43:15.309 --> 02:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
we have two 384 full-time staff
 
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
to provide services to the residents
 
02:43:21.290 --> 02:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
in theory we are we have quite a bit of
 
02:43:23.450 --> 02:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate on the New Hampshire
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home utilizes the VA Grant
 
02:43:29.870 --> 02:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
Program enabled under CFR 5141 which
 
02:43:32.270 --> 02:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
allows us to get partial or full payment
 
02:43:35.870 --> 02:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
for living reimbursements
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
the mission statement of the Veterans
 
02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
Home is to provide the best quality of
 
02:43:42.050 --> 02:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
life for New Hampshire veterans with
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
dignity honor and respect and I would
 
02:43:47.690 --> 02:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
say I'm pretty new to the facility I
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
came in January and the one thing you
 
02:43:52.010 --> 02:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
will feel as the staff take this
 
02:43:54.910 --> 02:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
position and this mission statement
 
02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
with great pride and provide the best
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
services for the residents
 
02:44:01.910 --> 02:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
I thought it was important to just point
 
02:44:03.950 --> 02:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
out a couple of our challenges and our
 
02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:05.510 align:start position:0%
out a couple of our challenges and our
achievements

02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
achievements
 
02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and because they they affect our
 
02:44:09.950 --> 02:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
budget so much so the first one is uh
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
our current challenge of Recruitment and
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
Retention of staff and it's not just
 
02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
clinical staff but also our non-clinical
 
02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:17.950 align:start position:0%
clinical staff but also our non-clinical
staff

02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:44:20.690 --> 02:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
historically in the state system we saw
 
02:44:23.750 --> 02:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
if a support service position was open
 
02:44:25.730 --> 02:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
people would take it even if it was part
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
time to get their foot in the door with
 
02:44:30.469 --> 02:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
a state position but now we can see
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
vacancies in our laundry
 
02:44:36.650 --> 02:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
our food service they can get paid so
 
02:44:39.650 --> 02:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
much in the community setting so
 
02:44:41.210 --> 02:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
um we are struggling in those
 
02:44:43.610 --> 02:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
non-clinical areas as well
 
02:44:46.010 --> 02:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh some of our achievements to try to uh
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
approach that and and turn that around
 
02:44:50.690 --> 02:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
is that we launched an internal LNA
 
02:44:53.330 --> 02:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant program in
 
02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
our facility uh so they um I'm sorry I
 
02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
didn't number them I'm pretty I don't
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
know if everybody's with me
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
um they we've had three classes uh We've
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
graduated nine lnas so far we just
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
started a class uh two weeks ago and
 
02:45:11.150 --> 02:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
there's seven students in that class so
 
02:45:14.389 --> 02:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
within this fiscal year we will have 16
 
02:45:18.290 --> 02:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
new lnas in our in our facility and our
 
02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
plan is to continue those classes back
 
02:45:24.170 --> 02:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
to back we were able to work with dop to
 
02:45:27.230 --> 02:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
enact the LNA trainee position we
 
02:45:30.110 --> 02:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
created part-time positions so the staff
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
we can hire staff part-time before the
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
class takes place and then they can earn
 
02:45:38.990 --> 02:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
as they learn so they work with us in
 
02:45:41.270 --> 02:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
the facility help residents do the
 
02:45:42.950 --> 02:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
things they can within their licensing
 
02:45:46.190 --> 02:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
restore frictions and then they take the
 
02:45:48.950 --> 02:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
class which is paid for and if they stay
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
with us for one year they don't have to
 
02:45:52.510 --> 02:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
pay that class back
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
and then they become full-time lnas and
 
02:45:59.150 --> 02:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
so it's been really rewarding and we've
 
02:46:01.070 --> 02:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
had some great successes with that so
 
02:46:03.290 --> 02:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
when we saw that we're working so well
 
02:46:05.929 --> 02:46:05.939 align:start position:0%
there's something called an m a medical
 
02:46:08.990 --> 02:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant program where lnas
 
02:46:10.730 --> 02:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
with certain criteria through the Board
 
02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
of Nursing they actually can take
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
another Pro another class and they can
 
02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
pass medications that don't require
 
02:46:22.010 --> 02:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
assessments so we're seeing big needs in
 
02:46:24.530 --> 02:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
our nursing department and having M A's
 
02:46:26.889 --> 02:46:26.899 align:start position:0%
that can pass traditional meds
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
medications is really helpful so we have
 
02:46:32.929 --> 02:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
created a program and that has been
 
02:46:34.429 --> 02:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
forwarded to the New Hampshire Board of
 
02:46:35.570 --> 02:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
Nursing and they're going to be
 
02:46:38.510 --> 02:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing that in December our hope is
 
02:46:41.090 --> 02:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
to create a career path so not only will
 
02:46:42.830 --> 02:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
we be able to recruit people to become
 
02:46:45.530 --> 02:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
lnas join the nursing field but they can
 
02:46:47.210 --> 02:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
also see a career path within our
 
02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:48.590 align:start position:0%
also see a career path within our
facility

02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
we reclassed a vacant position to focus
 
02:46:54.530 --> 02:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
on recruitment that position starts on
 
02:46:57.650 --> 02:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
the 2nd of December we've been improving
 
02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
onboarding and retention with more
 
02:47:01.969 --> 02:47:01.979 align:start position:0%
support and mentorship so if you're new
 
02:47:04.309 --> 02:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
to the facility what does that mean who
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
do you go to if you need help because
 
02:47:08.929 --> 02:47:08.939 align:start position:0%
it's not just getting them to the front
 
02:47:11.150 --> 02:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
door and hire them but it's keeping
 
02:47:13.250 --> 02:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
people if we invest that time we want to
 
02:47:14.870 --> 02:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
keep them there
 
02:47:17.150 --> 02:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
we're also improving Communications I
 
02:47:18.530 --> 02:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
was surprised when I came to the
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
facility that not everybody had email
 
02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and so I know there's a cost with
 
02:47:25.250 --> 02:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
that but communication is so important
 
02:47:27.290 --> 02:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
in a healthcare facility things happen
 
02:47:29.450 --> 02:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
daily that could change the way we act
 
02:47:32.330 --> 02:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
so we could have one person test
 
02:47:35.030 --> 02:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
positive and we may treat that unit
 
02:47:37.429 --> 02:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
differently and we were having a hard
 
02:47:39.290 --> 02:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
time getting that communication out to
 
02:47:40.910 --> 02:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
staff in a quick
 
02:47:43.610 --> 02:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and a quick process so we've now have
 
02:47:45.469 --> 02:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
everybody has email
 
02:47:47.630 --> 02:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
um and including that part of the
 
02:47:50.090 --> 02:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
communication and I think this employee
 
02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
satisfaction is that they know what's
 
02:47:53.389 --> 02:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
happening in their facility they have
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
some ownership to that so I meet with
 
02:47:59.389 --> 02:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
staff on all shifts on a quarterly basis
 
02:48:01.250 --> 02:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to do some of those
 
02:48:04.190 --> 02:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of communication building we
 
02:48:06.050 --> 02:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
recognize outstanding employees with
 
02:48:09.349 --> 02:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
hero awards that they their co-workers
 
02:48:11.270 --> 02:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
or their peers
 
02:48:13.250 --> 02:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
um you know nominate them so we're
 
02:48:16.490 --> 02:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
trying that piece we that challenge also
 
02:48:20.510 --> 02:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
comes our census so low staffed low
 
02:48:22.849 --> 02:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
census and that is not what we want to
 
02:48:26.469 --> 02:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
see we have a very significant wait list
 
02:48:30.050 --> 02:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
we have right now about 20 veterans in
 
02:48:31.790 --> 02:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
the community that are ready to come in
 
02:48:34.429 --> 02:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
the moment we have a bed and we have
 
02:48:37.730 --> 02:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
about 46 applications that are being
 
02:48:41.389 --> 02:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
processed so we know we could fill our
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
beds we just physically cannot do that
 
02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
with our staffing the way it is so one
 
02:48:49.070 --> 02:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
of our challenges is the Staffing we've
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
gone up about 10 since I got there I
 
02:48:53.270 --> 02:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
basically met with all the staff and
 
02:48:55.370 --> 02:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
said how many can we have here to
 
02:48:56.929 --> 02:48:56.939 align:start position:0%
provide the quality of care that they
 
02:48:59.630 --> 02:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
expect so our goal is 131 with our
 
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
staffing schedules like they are right
 
02:49:05.090 --> 02:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
now so how do we meet those needs so we
 
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
Consolidated partial units we had some
 
02:49:10.130 --> 02:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
units that weren't full so we we
 
02:49:12.889 --> 02:49:12.899 align:start position:0%
combined them we expanded light duty
 
02:49:14.750 --> 02:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
return to work programs so we had
 
02:49:16.309 --> 02:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
instead of them just being out of work
 
02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
what else can they do here and maybe
 
02:49:20.210 --> 02:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
they are in L A but maybe they could do
 
02:49:22.550 --> 02:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
some office work because we have uh
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
openings or they can fold laundry so
 
02:49:26.570 --> 02:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
we're trying to bring people back sooner
 
02:49:28.190 --> 02:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
we have increased the number of our
 
02:49:30.130 --> 02:49:30.140 align:start position:0%
volunteer opportunities
 
02:49:34.010 --> 02:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
the Veterans Home has so many supporters
 
02:49:35.870 --> 02:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
in the community from veterans service
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
organizations to individuals we have
 
02:49:41.330 --> 02:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
approximately a hundred active
 
02:49:45.650 --> 02:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
volunteers and and that's a lot a lot of
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
support that we can feel and we continue
 
02:49:50.809 --> 02:49:50.819 align:start position:0%
to mandate four-hour shifts every pay
 
02:49:53.270 --> 02:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
period for nursing all nursing including
 
02:49:56.929 --> 02:49:56.939 align:start position:0%
nursing that our office so our nurse
 
02:49:58.929 --> 02:49:58.939 align:start position:0%
managers our assistant nurse managers
 
02:50:03.050 --> 02:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
just to cover those shifts
 
02:50:06.290 --> 02:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
on our vacancy snapshot our overall
 
02:50:09.950 --> 02:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate is 35 for our facility we
 
02:50:11.690 --> 02:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
realize the biggest
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
um vacancy is actually our nurses and we
 
02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
Define that as nurse practitioner RN or
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
LPN licensed practical nurse or
 
02:50:23.330 --> 02:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
registered nurse we're about 48 without
 
02:50:25.969 --> 02:50:25.979 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate and for the lnas we're a
 
02:50:29.270 --> 02:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
little less with 43. we envision that
 
02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
that will keep getting smaller as we
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
have more and more classes but it is
 
02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
very difficult to recruit nurses and
 
02:50:40.370 --> 02:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
have nurses come join our team right now
 
02:50:42.349 --> 02:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is that we're seeing
 
02:50:44.510 --> 02:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
other nurses come from other state
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
organizations and that that just harms
 
02:50:49.790 --> 02:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
others so we're hoping that we'll see
 
02:50:52.010 --> 02:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
more uh one of the things I would like
 
02:50:54.469 --> 02:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
to do is just look at if there is a
 
02:50:56.830 --> 02:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
bridging program that we can do for
 
02:50:59.630 --> 02:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
nurses nursing assistants to help
 
02:51:02.990 --> 02:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
support them to become LPNs and LPN CPM
 
02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
sources and maybe we can sponsor some of
 
02:51:08.690 --> 02:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
those educational costs but it's not in
 
02:51:10.730 --> 02:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
the budget we stayed on on task for the
 
02:51:10.740 --> 02:51:11.929 align:start position:0%
the budget we stayed on on task for the
budget

02:51:11.929 --> 02:51:11.939 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
um we have as I mentioned three revenue
 
02:51:16.849 --> 02:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
streams and so general fund is the
 
02:51:19.130 --> 02:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
largest amount of forty percent seven
 
02:51:19.140 --> 02:51:20.330 align:start position:0%
largest amount of forty percent seven
percent

02:51:20.330 --> 02:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:51:22.490 --> 02:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
um and then the VA is a per diem rate
 
02:51:24.050 --> 02:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
and there's two different ways we get
 
02:51:24.060 --> 02:51:25.250 align:start position:0%
and there's two different ways we get
paid

02:51:25.250 --> 02:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
paid
 
02:51:27.950 --> 02:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
um a basic per diem rate is 121 dollars
 
02:51:31.730 --> 02:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
per day if the veteran has 70 percent or
 
02:51:35.330 --> 02:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
more of a disability that is related to
 
02:51:39.190 --> 02:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
um their service we actually get uh
 
02:51:43.250 --> 02:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
485.77 a day we have currently 11 of
 
02:51:46.130 --> 02:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
those residents on the higher rate the
 
02:51:47.990 --> 02:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
other piece of that is the residents
 
02:51:50.650 --> 02:51:50.660 align:start position:0%
themselves we have room and board costs
 
02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
if they have over thirty thousand
 
02:51:56.090 --> 02:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of assets they pay the
 
02:51:57.650 --> 02:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
full room and board until they hit that
 
02:52:00.170 --> 02:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollar less threshold if
 
02:52:04.370 --> 02:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
they have below 30 000 we do a formula
 
02:52:06.769 --> 02:52:06.779 align:start position:0%
based on their total monthly income
 
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
about it
 
02:52:12.050 --> 02:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
strategic priorities grow this census
 
02:52:15.530 --> 02:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
with the employee support our goal is to
 
02:52:18.170 --> 02:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
be at 225 veterans
 
02:52:20.330 --> 02:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
um with that finding that fine balance
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
of providing the service but also the
 
02:52:23.929 --> 02:52:23.939 align:start position:0%
quality we still need to make sure we
 
02:52:25.969 --> 02:52:25.979 align:start position:0%
provide the quality because to get those
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
per diem rates we must meet the VA
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
survey requirements they come out every
 
02:52:33.290 --> 02:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
April and they look at us and do a full
 
02:52:35.750 --> 02:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
survey of this Services we're providing
 
02:52:39.230 --> 02:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
the physical campus that type of thing
 
02:52:41.090 --> 02:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
um we are looking at some health uh life
 
02:52:43.010 --> 02:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
safety initiatives
 
02:52:44.630 --> 02:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
um for uh I think some people in this
 
02:52:47.450 --> 02:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
room are at our capital budget proposal
 
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
we do have some water that runs right
 
02:52:53.450 --> 02:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
through our basement uh area so we do
 
02:52:55.250 --> 02:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
have some projects that we're hoping to
 
02:52:55.260 --> 02:52:57.050 align:start position:0%
have some projects that we're hoping to
address

02:52:57.050 --> 02:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:52:59.090 --> 02:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
um and we also are looking at enhancing
 
02:53:01.130 --> 02:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
our security readers we have security
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
cards right now on most of our doors but
 
02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
not all Outdoors all of the exits so we
 
02:53:10.610 --> 02:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
like to try to improve in that
 
02:53:13.309 --> 02:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
in this budget coming we have asked for
 
02:53:16.910 --> 02:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
to replace aging Vans we have some vans
 
02:53:19.849 --> 02:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
that are quite old and
 
02:53:22.429 --> 02:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
um I think they've reached their end as
 
02:53:24.769 --> 02:53:24.779 align:start position:0%
far as welding them together
 
02:53:26.210 --> 02:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
um so we're hoping to see that go
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
through we also are looking at
 
02:53:29.929 --> 02:53:29.939 align:start position:0%
installing some mechanical lifts into
 
02:53:32.750 --> 02:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
our ceilings so we can improve the
 
02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
ability to move people safely and lower
 
02:53:41.090 --> 02:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
the risk of having injuries to our staff
 
02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then we are looking to increase our
 
02:53:45.730 --> 02:53:45.740 align:start position:0%
contracted Services we need to provide
 
02:53:45.740 --> 02:53:47.710 align:start position:0%
contracted Services we need to provide
more

02:53:47.710 --> 02:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:53:49.969 --> 02:53:49.979 align:start position:0%
in-house services around Physical
 
02:53:54.650 --> 02:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
Therapy around a laboratory and then we
 
02:53:57.110 --> 02:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
also we do have a temporary staffing
 
02:53:58.849 --> 02:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
contract that was approved from the
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
governor Council and the fiscal
 
02:54:02.269 --> 02:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
committee however the agency has not
 
02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
been able to provide us with one not one
 
02:54:07.969 --> 02:54:07.979 align:start position:0%
person so we are going to need to look
 
02:54:11.630 --> 02:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
at expanding that so we can go for a
 
02:54:15.710 --> 02:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
nursing contract we really feel the
 
02:54:18.110 --> 02:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
burden of the lack of nurses during
 
02:54:21.830 --> 02:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
weekends holidays if we have coveted in
 
02:54:23.809 --> 02:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
that facility and people are sick so we
 
02:54:26.030 --> 02:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
need to have some kind of backup plan
 
02:54:28.490 --> 02:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
with the contracts and then the it
 
02:54:32.330 --> 02:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
infrastructure upgrades like I said we
 
02:54:34.429 --> 02:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
um need to be able to communicate with
 
02:54:37.070 --> 02:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
staff we need to be able to communicate
 
02:54:39.050 --> 02:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
with our residents and the residents
 
02:54:41.090 --> 02:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
communicate with their families when we
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
have a coveted outbreak it makes the
 
02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
facility uh close down a little bit and
 
02:54:48.110 --> 02:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
so the families still need access and
 
02:54:50.090 --> 02:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
right now in most of our building you
 
02:54:52.010 --> 02:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
cannot get Wi-Fi and based on the
 
02:54:54.170 --> 02:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
building structure
 
02:54:56.750 --> 02:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh then there's just a snapshot of our
 
02:54:59.150 --> 02:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
budget of what we're asking for
 
02:55:02.150 --> 02:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
um over the next two years executive
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
summary we did uh just we stayed within
 
02:55:07.550 --> 02:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's parameters we did a three
 
02:55:10.790 --> 02:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
percent increase over the last budget uh
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
we level funded for 25. again as I spoke
 
02:55:15.889 --> 02:55:15.899 align:start position:0%
about we asked for additional funding
 
02:55:18.590 --> 02:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
for Consultation Services we also know
 
02:55:21.290 --> 02:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
that in the next the next year our
 
02:55:24.110 --> 02:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
medical service contract is going to be
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
up and so we have a very low medical
 
02:55:30.349 --> 02:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
service contract
 
02:55:32.809 --> 02:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
um and so the concern is will that stay
 
02:55:34.910 --> 02:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
that way because we all know how hard it
 
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
is to find staff
 
02:55:38.570 --> 02:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and I talked about investing in
 
02:55:42.590 --> 02:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
clinical and custodial equipment
 
02:55:45.469 --> 02:55:45.479 align:start position:0%
we have a high tradition of providing
 
02:55:47.809 --> 02:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
care our high level of quality of care
 
02:55:49.610 --> 02:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
our residents expected our families
 
02:55:53.090 --> 02:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
expected and our staff expectant and so
 
02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
with the continuing support of the
 
02:55:57.530 --> 02:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
governor and this committee we hope to
 
02:56:02.330 --> 02:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:04.190 --> 02:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you you
 
02:56:07.309 --> 02:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned the 35 percent vacancy rate
 
02:56:08.929 --> 02:56:08.939 align:start position:0%
and especially highlighted by the
 
02:56:12.170 --> 02:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
nursing yes has the the state's
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
incentive program for nursing
 
02:56:18.110 --> 02:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
helped at all in that in bringing in
 
02:56:20.690 --> 02:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
nurses in the you know the last few
 
02:56:22.250 --> 02:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
months and and what does that look like
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
going forward yes I believe so I I think
 
02:56:27.230 --> 02:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
that we are cautious about how we
 
02:56:29.210 --> 02:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
presented to any new employee that's
 
02:56:30.889 --> 02:56:30.899 align:start position:0%
coming from the outside to let them know
 
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
that this is a 15 enhancement
 
02:56:37.490 --> 02:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
um that for us expires March 2024 and
 
02:56:39.950 --> 02:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
then the additional 15 until June 30.
 
02:56:42.769 --> 02:56:42.779 align:start position:0%
but we have had we just hired a staff
 
02:56:45.110 --> 02:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
development nurse from the community so
 
02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
we are seeing some movement and again we
 
02:56:49.309 --> 02:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
are we've also seen some movement from
 
02:56:52.130 --> 02:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
other agencies which I feel bad about
 
02:56:55.130 --> 02:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we need them so um
 
02:56:56.750 --> 02:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
so I think the enhancements are
 
02:56:58.370 --> 02:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
definitely helping
 
02:57:01.849 --> 02:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
um helping with the lnas for sure people
 
02:57:03.830 --> 02:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
are wanting to join our team because it
 
02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
is equivalent to what they're making in
 
02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
the community nursing a little slower
 
02:57:09.290 --> 02:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
and I just think that's because the
 
02:57:12.349 --> 02:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
community there's less nurses is this a
 
02:57:13.790 --> 02:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
matter of with nursing is this a matter
 
02:57:16.309 --> 02:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
of for many state agencies just a matter
 
02:57:18.590 --> 02:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
of payment they will come yes you know
 
02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
but with nursing it's different I mean
 
02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
nursing the nursing nursing shortage
 
02:57:23.870 --> 02:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
isn't something unique to New Hampshire
 
02:57:25.849 --> 02:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
or New England or Regional it's
 
02:57:29.809 --> 02:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
Nationwide yes uh is this more of a
 
02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
long-term problem in actually training
 
02:57:34.010 --> 02:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
nurses because obviously it's not a
 
02:57:35.450 --> 02:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
quick fix you can't get someone in here
 
02:57:37.190 --> 02:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
and have them be a nurse two months from
 
02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
now right I think part of it is we have
 
02:57:41.570 --> 02:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
to find ways to speak to them so the
 
02:57:43.370 --> 02:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
quality of life
 
02:57:45.110 --> 02:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and so someone who's a licensed
 
02:57:47.570 --> 02:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
practical nurse may be at our facility
 
02:57:49.610 --> 02:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
and has thought about becoming an RN but
 
02:57:51.349 --> 02:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the monies or how am I
 
02:57:52.910 --> 02:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
going to leave my job to do that it
 
02:57:55.490 --> 02:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
takes a year to make that happen it's
 
02:57:57.230 --> 02:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
twenty three thousand dollars for them
 
02:57:59.809 --> 02:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
to become an RN I feel like that's an
 
02:58:01.910 --> 02:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
excellent investment if we can ask for
 
02:58:03.830 --> 02:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
them to sign a contract with it stays
 
02:58:06.410 --> 02:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
for two years so I think there are ways
 
02:58:08.510 --> 02:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
that we can make it even more attractive
 
02:58:11.469 --> 02:58:11.479 align:start position:0%
to come to the veterans home but I think
 
02:58:14.030 --> 02:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
the other comments of all the other
 
02:58:15.410 --> 02:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
facilities in this across the country
 
02:58:18.650 --> 02:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
are experiencing the same thing and I
 
02:58:19.790 --> 02:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if that means we need more
 
02:58:21.469 --> 02:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
nursing schools I don't know how we
 
02:58:22.969 --> 02:58:22.979 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
02:58:24.730 --> 02:58:24.740 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:58:27.730 --> 02:58:27.740 align:start position:0%
in here you mentioned that 24
 
02:58:29.929 --> 02:58:29.939 align:start position:0%
basically private pay people paying out
 
02:58:32.210 --> 02:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
of their own pocket for their revenue is
 
02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
that mostly through insurance or are
 
02:58:35.450 --> 02:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
they just writing a check from their
 
02:58:36.889 --> 02:58:36.899 align:start position:0%
bank accounts it comes from their
 
02:58:39.230 --> 02:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
pensions usually their retirement's a
 
02:58:41.330 --> 02:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
portion of their pensions so they keep a
 
02:58:43.370 --> 02:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
10 percent I'm gonna look at Stephanie
 
02:58:45.710 --> 02:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
if I start to misspeak they keep 10
 
02:58:45.720 --> 02:58:47.030 align:start position:0%
if I start to misspeak they keep 10
percent

02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:58:49.550 --> 02:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
um and 100 which I'm not sure one
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and then 10 and um again
 
02:58:54.769 --> 02:58:54.779 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not tacking on the
 
02:58:57.830 --> 02:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
spouse at home's income this is just
 
02:59:01.190 --> 02:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
their income that they pay okay and
 
02:59:04.010 --> 02:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's two housekeeping items uh one you
 
02:59:05.389 --> 02:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
had a position where we have talked
 
02:59:06.650 --> 02:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
about and I might understand is you
 
02:59:09.530 --> 02:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
withdrawn that position yes sir okay uh
 
02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk about that yes um so
 
02:59:15.769 --> 02:59:15.779 align:start position:0%
we have a combination of a CFO and a COO
 
02:59:17.870 --> 02:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
position at the veterans home it's very
 
02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:19.370 align:start position:0%
position at the veterans home it's very
unique

02:59:19.370 --> 02:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
unique
 
02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh unfortunately our person who's
 
02:59:25.070 --> 02:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
doing that has well fortunately and
 
02:59:25.910 --> 02:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately unfortunately
 
02:59:28.010 --> 02:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for me but for the country
 
02:59:28.020 --> 02:59:29.090 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for me but for the country
great

02:59:29.090 --> 02:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:59:31.550 --> 02:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
um he has been deployed and so that has
 
02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:32.750 align:start position:0%
um he has been deployed and so that has
left

02:59:32.750 --> 02:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
left
 
02:59:35.090 --> 02:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
um a bit of a learning curve for me to
 
02:59:38.809 --> 02:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
cover that CFO uh position so I was
 
02:59:42.469 --> 02:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
going to be requesting a full-time CFO
 
02:59:44.510 --> 02:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
position from the
 
02:59:47.389 --> 02:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
um for the budget however we're going to
 
02:59:50.389 --> 02:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
move towards the 80 ask for a temporary
 
02:59:54.469 --> 02:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
position while he is not in service and
 
02:59:54.479 --> 02:59:55.370 align:start position:0%
position while he is not in service and
then

02:59:55.370 --> 02:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:59:57.769 --> 02:59:57.779 align:start position:0%
um consider he is expected to be back in
 
02:59:59.630 --> 02:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
the next year so I think the 18 will
 
03:00:02.330 --> 03:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
bring us through that okay great and
 
03:00:04.429 --> 03:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
again just housekeeping uh in in the
 
03:00:05.870 --> 03:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
capital budget you're requesting money
 
03:00:08.389 --> 03:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
for it basically expanding the sprinkler
 
03:00:11.269 --> 03:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
system yes uh that was met I believe
 
03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
through Opera funding yeah so you no
 
03:00:15.469 --> 03:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
longer have that it's not it yes not
 
03:00:18.370 --> 03:00:18.380 align:start position:0%
needed um it was yes absolutely okay
 
03:00:20.690 --> 03:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that answers my
 
03:00:20.700 --> 03:00:22.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that answers my
questions

03:00:22.910 --> 03:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:25.849 --> 03:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
he asked most of mine he did yeah you
 
03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
have nothing uh the only thing I want to
 
03:00:29.929 --> 03:00:29.939 align:start position:0%
say is uh I've been to the veterans home
 
03:00:32.150 --> 03:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
only twice and each time was a very
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
moving experience and it's uh obvious
 
03:00:37.849 --> 03:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
from the people who work there and uh in
 
03:00:39.410 --> 03:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
the time I spent there what a dedicated
 
03:00:42.230 --> 03:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
staff you have and how dedicated they
 
03:00:43.490 --> 03:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
are to their mission
 
03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree incredibly dedicated
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
you can feel it when you come in and the
 
03:00:50.269 --> 03:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
community support as well and we're
 
03:00:53.690 --> 03:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
we're very lucky our veterans are
 
03:00:55.490 --> 03:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
um they deserve it they definitely
 
03:00:57.230 --> 03:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
deserve it I feel that way when I come
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
into administrative Services too but
 
03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's slightly different they're like oh
 
03:01:05.450 --> 03:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:05.460 --> 03:01:07.429 align:start position:0%
 
questions

afternoon
um

um
 
03:02:02.690 --> 03:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Port Authority was
 
03:02:05.630 --> 03:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
established by the statute in 1957 and
 
03:02:07.750 --> 03:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
it was a standalone state agency until
 
03:02:10.849 --> 03:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
2001 when the legislature emerged as
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
administratively with the peace
 
03:02:14.330 --> 03:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
Development Authority
 
03:02:17.870 --> 03:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
at that time the statute said that any
 
03:02:22.370 --> 03:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
existing classified employees such shall
 
03:02:24.969 --> 03:02:24.979 align:start position:0%
remain so at the time of that
 
03:02:24.979 --> 03:02:26.769 align:start position:0%
remain so at the time of that
administrator

03:02:26.769 --> 03:02:26.779 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
03:02:29.690 --> 03:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
change there was there were six
 
03:02:33.469 --> 03:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
classified positions through attrition
 
03:02:37.250 --> 03:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
one was replaced with a non-classified
 
03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
PDA position
 
03:02:42.769 --> 03:02:42.779 align:start position:0%
we've just recently replaced another one
 
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
so we're the books say we have five but
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're actually down to down to four
 
03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:49.610 align:start position:0%
we're actually down to down to four
positions

03:02:49.610 --> 03:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:02:51.530 --> 03:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
um as Paul said
 
03:02:53.389 --> 03:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
um even though it shows up in the budget
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
because they are classified positions we
 
03:02:59.570 --> 03:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
reimburse 100 of the salaries and
 
03:03:02.570 --> 03:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
benefits back to the state uh through
 
03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
revenues that we generate from our
 
03:03:07.730 --> 03:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
businesses at the port
 
03:03:11.090 --> 03:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
um so uh as of right now we have eight
 
03:03:15.050 --> 03:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
full-time non-classified positions and
 
03:03:16.849 --> 03:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
we only have
 
03:03:19.070 --> 03:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
um the five that are on the books but we
 
03:03:21.469 --> 03:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
have only filled
 
03:03:24.769 --> 03:03:24.779 align:start position:0%
um actually I I misspoke we have we have
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
four five positions one of them was
 
03:03:29.990 --> 03:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
filled with a non-classified we do have
 
03:03:31.910 --> 03:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
an empty position and we're interviewing
 
03:03:34.750 --> 03:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
and that is a deputy chief Harbor Master
 
03:03:37.370 --> 03:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh and under the statute the deputy
 
03:03:40.010 --> 03:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
chief Harbor Master has to be certified
 
03:03:44.450 --> 03:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
by cstc as a police officer so that
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
position will remain a classified
 
03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:47.389 align:start position:0%
position will remain a classified
position

03:03:47.389 --> 03:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:03:52.010 --> 03:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
so uh our statutory charge is to promote
 
03:03:54.950 --> 03:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
the movement of freight throughout ports
 
03:03:57.650 --> 03:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
and harbors and provide the development
 
03:03:59.510 --> 03:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
of boating facilities for the boat
 
03:04:01.130 --> 03:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
travel that moves up and down the
 
03:04:03.469 --> 03:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
coaster in our tidal waterways
 
03:04:06.769 --> 03:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
and we've been pretty successful for the
 
03:04:10.849 --> 03:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
last 20 years supporting ourselves
 
03:04:15.230 --> 03:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:17.809 --> 03:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
um yeah you're sort of my model budget
 
03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
because there are no no General funds
 
03:04:21.170 --> 03:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
and your budget actually looks like it
 
03:04:22.849 --> 03:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
decreased by about a hundred thousand
 
03:04:24.530 --> 03:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
dollars from 23 to 24 you have no
 
03:04:26.450 --> 03:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs
 
03:04:29.870 --> 03:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's as clean as it gets well I I will
 
03:04:31.070 --> 03:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
say this
 
03:04:34.030 --> 03:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect
 
03:04:36.590 --> 03:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
when they first merged us with peas I
 
03:04:38.210 --> 03:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
didn't know anything about them I only
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
knew what I read in the newspapers it
 
03:04:41.570 --> 03:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
wasn't until I got there and I got
 
03:04:43.610 --> 03:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
involved in the administration as a
 
03:04:46.010 --> 03:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
senior staff member that I really found
 
03:04:48.170 --> 03:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
out what a pretty good organization they
 
03:04:50.150 --> 03:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
are and what they did is they gave us
 
03:04:53.090 --> 03:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
resources we didn't have before
 
03:04:54.950 --> 03:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we've got a finance director
 
03:04:58.130 --> 03:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
that handles all of our bill paying and
 
03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
invoicing we've got uh you know
 
03:05:03.650 --> 03:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
Personnel people we've got
 
03:05:03.660 --> 03:05:04.630 align:start position:0%
Personnel people we've got
um

03:05:04.630 --> 03:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:07.849 --> 03:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
information RIT people and most
 
03:05:09.429 --> 03:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
important of all we've got a
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
problem-solving team we meet regularly
 
03:05:15.230 --> 03:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
the senior staff members and we throw it
 
03:05:17.590 --> 03:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
on the table and somewhere in the mix
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
there are some good ideas that come out
 
03:05:23.090 --> 03:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
on how we solve problems and I I give
 
03:05:25.429 --> 03:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
credit to the peas organization and and
 
03:05:27.410 --> 03:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
the people in the legislature that set
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
it up and it's certainly been an
 
03:05:32.650 --> 03:05:32.660 align:start position:0%
advantage to us to operate as a business
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
served serve the public and generate the
 
03:05:42.170 --> 03:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:43.730 --> 03:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:05:46.849 --> 03:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
I desperately want to ask you know a
 
03:05:49.090 --> 03:05:49.100 align:start position:0%
question and I can't think of one to ask
 
03:05:51.469 --> 03:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
so I know we're working with you on the

results that may not be
 
03:05:58.490 --> 03:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
completely happy for everybody but we're
 
03:06:00.230 --> 03:06:00.240 align:start position:0%

critical vacant positions that are
 
04:19:28.729 --> 04:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
currently in prioritized needs due to

04:20:44.750 --> 04:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
Safety mission of each of our seven
 
04:20:46.969 --> 04:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
divisions and provide a summary of
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
changes prioritized needs and related
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
impacts in the service delivery we're
 
04:20:53.870 --> 04:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that may
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
have throughout the presentation thank
 
04:20:57.650 --> 04:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
you Steve
 
04:21:00.050 --> 04:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner oh good afternoon
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
everyone so we'll dive into the
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
presentation here starting on page two
 
04:21:05.929 --> 04:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
which provides an organizational summary
 
04:21:07.910 --> 04:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the department as a whole as the
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned there are seven
 
04:21:10.969 --> 04:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
divisions within the department of
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
safety each is funded uniquely with
 
04:21:15.650 --> 04:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
various funding sources and so it really
 
04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
makes sense for us to present our budget
 
04:21:19.550 --> 04:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
request at a divisional level and that's
 
04:21:21.050 --> 04:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do today
 
04:21:22.849 --> 04:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
page three before we get into the
 
04:21:24.530 --> 04:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
division level was the overall summary
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
request for the Department as a whole so
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
for FY 24 of the Department of Safety is
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
requesting a total of 240 million
 
04:21:33.969 --> 04:21:33.979 align:start position:0%
dollars and in 25
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
240.7 million dollars to fund Public
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
Safety Services across the state
 
04:21:41.830 --> 04:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
um those funds support
 
04:21:45.110 --> 04:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
1151 full-time classified positions and
 
04:21:47.570 --> 04:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
13 unclassified Physicians however there
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
are 107 classified positions that are
 
04:21:51.889 --> 04:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
currently within prioritized needs and
 
04:21:54.290 --> 04:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
not included in those amounts
 
04:21:56.150 --> 04:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
what's also presented here is the fact
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
that we're very people-driven
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
organization 55 of our costs are
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
associated with salaries and benefits
 
04:22:04.670 --> 04:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
with the remaining factoring in with
 
04:22:06.530 --> 04:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
operating costs many of those operating
 
04:22:08.809 --> 04:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
costs are funds and grants that are
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
distributed to locals and other state
 
04:22:10.680 --> 04:22:12.410 align:start position:0%
distributed to locals and other state
agencies

04:22:12.410 --> 04:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:22:15.950 --> 04:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
our 24 budget increased by 7.2 million
 
04:22:17.929 --> 04:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
dollars due to Inc General increase in
 
04:22:19.729 --> 04:22:19.739 align:start position:0%
the cost of doing business operating
 
04:22:21.769 --> 04:22:21.779 align:start position:0%
cost increases including replacement
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
equipment supplies and contracts there's
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
also an increase in federal fund
 
04:22:28.429 --> 04:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh that's associated
 
04:22:31.250 --> 04:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
primarily With Disaster grant funding a
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
lot of that being related to the covet
 
04:22:35.150 --> 04:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
disaster that occurred over the last
 
04:22:36.769 --> 04:22:36.779 align:start position:0%
several years and those are funds that
 
04:22:38.150 --> 04:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
will be distributed to State and local
 
04:22:38.160 --> 04:22:39.469 align:start position:0%
will be distributed to State and local
agencies

04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:22:42.410 --> 04:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
5.8 million in the increase is due to a
 
04:22:44.510 --> 04:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
change in administrative budgeting
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
practice which results in in a double
 
04:22:49.370 --> 04:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
budgeting because of the dedicated funds
 
04:22:51.530 --> 04:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
that are used to support those areas and
 
04:22:53.330 --> 04:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
three million dollars an increase is due
 
04:22:55.849 --> 04:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
to increased doit related costs and
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
those are attributed to Major I.T
 
04:23:00.290 --> 04:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
systems at DMV and at State Police that
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
had significant cost increases over the
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
last year
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner mentioned we have
 
04:23:08.150 --> 04:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
several positions in prioritized need
 
04:23:12.110 --> 04:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
with a total of 16.1 million in uh 24
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
and 13.8 million in 25.
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
so we turn to page four we'll move on to
 
04:23:20.689 --> 04:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner
 
04:23:22.010 --> 04:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner in
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
addition to overseeing the entire
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
department and all seven divisions also
 
04:23:28.849 --> 04:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
directly oversees the office of Highway
 
04:23:31.130 --> 04:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
Safety the department of safety's legal
 
04:23:33.650 --> 04:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
unit and the Bro of hearings
 
04:23:35.630 --> 04:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
page five shows the office of the
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner's budget request for fy24
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner is
 
04:23:43.490 --> 04:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
requesting 20.0 million dollars and for
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
22 20.2 million dollars
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
32 percent of those funds support salary
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
and benefits for the positions within
 
04:23:53.330 --> 04:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner which are
 
04:23:55.550 --> 04:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
45 classified and three unclassified
 
04:23:57.650 --> 04:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
Physicians there are no unfunded
 
04:23:59.469 --> 04:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
positions within this unit
 
04:24:01.610 --> 04:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner as I
 
04:24:02.689 --> 04:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
mentioned includes the Bureau of
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
hearings which conducts uh over 14 000
 
04:24:08.389 --> 04:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
hearings every year and also the office
 
04:24:11.330 --> 04:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
of Highway Safety which in FY 22 awarded
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
over 886 thousand dollars to 81 local
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
police departments for enforcement
 
04:24:16.560 --> 04:24:18.290 align:start position:0%
police departments for enforcement
activities

04:24:18.290 --> 04:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
activities
 
04:24:20.809 --> 04:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
uh the budget is relatively flat there's
 
04:24:22.610 --> 04:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a decrease from prior
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
year amounts and that's due primarily to
 
04:24:26.630 --> 04:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
moving some Debt Service expenditures
 
04:24:28.370 --> 04:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
that were being paid for out of the
 
04:24:30.590 --> 04:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner to a separate
 
04:24:32.570 --> 04:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
accounting unit within special expenses
 
04:24:34.849 --> 04:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the funding is
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate in those areas and there are
 
04:24:39.769 --> 04:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
a few prioritized needs small amounts
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
but 199 000 and 24 and 132 025 which are
 
04:24:46.670 --> 04:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
to fund additional costs for maintenance
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
conducted by the department of
 
04:24:50.450 --> 04:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
administrative services for our 33 Hazen
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
Drive facilities then also twelve
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to fund additional
 
04:24:56.210 --> 04:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
retiree Health estimated payments and
 
04:24:58.010 --> 04:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
those were prioritized by the department
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%

administration's organizational chart
 
04:25:07.490 --> 04:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
in the division of administration
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
provides internal Support Services to
 
04:25:10.670 --> 04:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
all the divisions within the department
 
04:25:12.769 --> 04:25:12.779 align:start position:0%
of safety and is comprised of six
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%

04:25:24.530 --> 04:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
page seven shows the division of
 
04:25:27.889 --> 04:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
administration's budget request of 11.2
 
04:25:30.650 --> 04:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars for FY 24 and 11.5
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars for fy25
 
04:25:36.170 --> 04:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
66 percent of those funds support salary
 
04:25:37.849 --> 04:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
and benefits for the employees within
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
that within this division those are 85
 
04:25:42.410 --> 04:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
classified and two unclassified
 
04:25:45.110 --> 04:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
employees there are three unfunded
 
04:25:46.729 --> 04:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
full-time positions that are in
 
04:25:50.030 --> 04:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
prioritized need one of those is a new
 
04:25:52.130 --> 04:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
position and two of those are existing
 
04:25:54.290 --> 04:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
vacant unfunded positions
 
04:25:55.910 --> 04:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
and some highlights for the division in
 
04:25:59.210 --> 04:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
22 the road till Bureau collected 181
 
04:26:01.309 --> 04:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Road till revenues to
 
04:26:04.010 --> 04:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
support the highway fund and Pros the
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
mail unit process 1.8 million pieces of
 
04:26:08.330 --> 04:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
incoming mail and 1.3 million pieces of
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
outgoing mail and the plate room
 
04:26:12.290 --> 04:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
distributed 567
 
04:26:14.870 --> 04:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
000 license plates and 1.8 million plate
 
04:26:16.790 --> 04:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
decals to municipalities and DMV
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
substations across the state
 
04:26:22.490 --> 04:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
there's a slight decrease in overall
 
04:26:25.729 --> 04:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
budget from FY 23 and that's due to a
 
04:26:28.969 --> 04:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
reallocation of doit expenses to other
 
04:26:31.070 --> 04:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
divisions within the department
 
04:26:33.410 --> 04:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
another change in the division of
 
04:26:34.969 --> 04:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
administration is the transfer of three
 
04:26:37.490 --> 04:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
existing facilities positions which were
 
04:26:39.530 --> 04:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
funded in other divisions moving them
 
04:26:41.570 --> 04:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
into the facilities management Bureau to
 
04:26:44.210 --> 04:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
support the department as a whole
 
04:26:46.490 --> 04:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
on page 8 there's some details of the
 
04:26:48.170 --> 04:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs within the division of
 
04:26:49.610 --> 04:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
administration including the two
 
04:26:51.710 --> 04:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
existing vacant Road till auditor two
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
positions just noting that audits are an
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
important way to ensure voluntary
 
04:26:58.790 --> 04:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
compliance with the road toll which is
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
also known as the state's gas tax and
 
04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
that not filling all auditor positions

driver licenses and ID cards
 
04:29:15.290 --> 04:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
the increase from 23 to 24 is due in
 
04:29:16.910 --> 04:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
large part to an increase in doit
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
expenses as mentioned earlier and those
 
04:29:20.990 --> 04:29:21.000 align:start position:0%

for the Division of Motor Vehicles
 
04:29:51.050 --> 04:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
primarily dealing with the Personnel so
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
the first is to fully fund part-time
 
04:29:54.670 --> 04:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
positions across the entire division
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
part-timers are used at Opera at
 
04:29:59.090 --> 04:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
locations across the state as well as
 
04:30:01.070 --> 04:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
for back office functions and are
 
04:30:03.710 --> 04:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
utilized to help leverage and change
 
04:30:05.870 --> 04:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
Staffing Resources as volumes fluctuate
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the year
 
04:30:11.210 --> 04:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
also funding two uh one one data entry

position in the Bro certificate of title
 
04:30:19.250 --> 04:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
these positions are required to process
 
04:30:22.189 --> 04:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
title transactions and limit delays and
 
04:30:24.950 --> 04:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
also not funding these positions could
 
04:30:27.290 --> 04:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
result in delays in implementing new
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%

04:30:29.399 --> 04:30:31.729 align:start position:0%

processing
 
04:30:33.950 --> 04:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
there's also requests to fund four data
 
04:30:36.530 --> 04:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
control clerk three positions these
 
04:30:37.550 --> 04:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
positions are in the financial
 
04:30:39.950 --> 04:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility Bureau and without these
 
04:30:41.389 --> 04:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
positions there will be impacts of
 
04:30:43.309 --> 04:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
driver history records and ensuring that
 
04:30:46.010 --> 04:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
those records remain up to date
 
04:30:49.330 --> 04:30:49.340 align:start position:0%
finally the EMV the DMV Epping
 
04:30:52.610 --> 04:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
relocation request the DMV currently
 
04:30:55.250 --> 04:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
operates out of the Epping location
 
04:30:57.769 --> 04:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
shared with the State Police Troop
 
04:31:01.370 --> 04:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
station in Epping the
 
04:31:04.849 --> 04:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
the area has we've outgrown the existing
 
04:31:07.010 --> 04:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
location uh the volume is just too large
 
04:31:09.050 --> 04:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
it's also not a great location to get
 
04:31:10.849 --> 04:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
driver licensing
 
04:31:13.070 --> 04:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
um tests out of of that area there's
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
been increased traffic along that area
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
and so the DMV is looking to relocate to
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
a different location within Epping and
 
04:31:21.290 --> 04:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
those funds would be required in order
 
04:31:23.689 --> 04:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
to do that and then finally the DMV is
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
looking to open a new location in
 
04:31:28.610 --> 04:31:28.620 align:start position:0%

04:31:30.769 --> 04:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
in both Concord and Tamworth continue to
 
04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
increase because individuals in The
 
04:31:35.570 --> 04:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region have to choose to go to one
 
04:31:37.849 --> 04:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
of those two locations this would meet a
 
04:31:40.490 --> 04:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
need in that area and would hopefully
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
reduce wait times in both those areas as
 
04:31:42.720 --> 04:31:45.469 align:start position:0%
reduce wait times in both those areas as
well

04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%

04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
plan was not fully funded in Prior
 
04:33:34.429 --> 04:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
biennium and then supply chain shortages
 
04:33:37.789 --> 04:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
over supply shortages limited our
 
04:33:40.010 --> 04:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
ability to make all budgeted
 
04:33:41.449 --> 04:33:41.459 align:start position:0%
Replacements that were planned in the
 
04:33:43.929 --> 04:33:43.939 align:start position:0%
prior two years
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
2.2 million in increases are due to
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
increased costs for ongoing maintenance
 
04:33:49.609 --> 04:33:49.619 align:start position:0%
of critical New Hampshire State Police

management system
 
04:33:58.369 --> 04:33:58.379 align:start position:0%
and also increased maintenance of the
 
04:34:00.051 --> 04:34:00.061 align:start position:0%
state's message platform which is used
 
04:34:01.369 --> 04:34:01.379 align:start position:0%
to pass criminal justice information
 
04:34:03.769 --> 04:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
between federal state and local law
 
04:34:07.010 --> 04:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
on page 14 we start to look at some of
 
04:34:11.570 --> 04:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
the detailed prioritized needs for state
 
04:34:11.580 --> 04:34:13.131 align:start position:0%

04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollars is required to fund

10 Troopers two sergeants and one
 
04:34:20.029 --> 04:34:20.039 align:start position:0%
lieutenant in the detectives Bureau
 
04:34:21.890 --> 04:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
these are positions that work in the
 
04:34:23.449 --> 04:34:23.459 align:start position:0%

unit and are also serve as troop
 
04:34:30.051 --> 04:34:30.061 align:start position:0%
detectives and they're critical to
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we prevent a negative
 
04:34:35.449 --> 04:34:35.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:38.449 --> 04:34:38.459 align:start position:0%
in the traffic PRL we're requesting 2.3
 
04:34:40.369 --> 04:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
million dollars to fund 16 Trooper
 
04:34:42.709 --> 04:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
positions these positions are located in
 
04:34:44.689 --> 04:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
troop a and Epping Troop B in Bedford
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
and Troop D and Concord
 
04:34:49.609 --> 04:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
and correspond to that request is 1.5
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
million to replace 20 vehicles in FY 24.
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that a vehicle is
 
04:34:58.189 --> 04:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
considered equipment for a state police
 
04:35:00.830 --> 04:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
Troopers perspective a trooper without a
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
vehicle can't perform their services and
 
04:35:05.029 --> 04:35:05.039 align:start position:0%
so those two are really linked together
 
04:35:07.070 --> 04:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see a similar linking between the
 
04:35:08.570 --> 04:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement Bureau request of 14
 
04:35:10.849 --> 04:35:10.859 align:start position:0%

04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
on page 14 you'll see a request for 1.5
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
million for commercial enforcement to
 
04:35:28.849 --> 04:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
fund 14 Trooper positions and four
 
04:35:32.090 --> 04:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
vehicles in FY 24 as well
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
commercial enforcement operates out of
 
04:35:36.349 --> 04:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
Troop G and there's Statewide Mission
 
04:35:38.449 --> 04:35:38.459 align:start position:0%
and they're focused primarily on
 
04:35:39.890 --> 04:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
Commercial Motor Vehicle Enforcement
 
04:35:42.410 --> 04:35:42.420 align:start position:0%

04:35:44.631 --> 04:35:44.641 align:start position:0%
to the motor carrier Safety assistance
 
04:35:47.449 --> 04:35:47.459 align:start position:0%
program also known as mix app which is
 
04:35:49.910 --> 04:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
federally funded program that requires a
 
04:35:51.349 --> 04:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort and so it's
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
critical that we fund the existing
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
levels of services at state funded level
 
04:35:57.230 --> 04:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the federal funds are
 
04:35:59.769 --> 04:35:59.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:02.510 --> 04:36:02.520 align:start position:0%

04:36:06.609 --> 04:36:06.619 align:start position:0%
positions with a mobile enforcement team
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
and this is a team that focuses on
 
04:36:11.449 --> 04:36:11.459 align:start position:0%

they're needed to prevent negative
 
04:36:16.490 --> 04:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
impact of Public Safety response time
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then also ensure that officer safety
 
04:36:19.970 --> 04:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
issues and the mental health and
 
04:36:21.529 --> 04:36:21.539 align:start position:0%

04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
there are also civilian positions
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
included in prioritized needs there's
 
04:36:31.369 --> 04:36:31.379 align:start position:0%
two criminalists two positions two
 
04:36:33.529 --> 04:36:33.539 align:start position:0%

04:36:35.090 --> 04:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
criminal evidence technician position
 
04:36:37.730 --> 04:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
within the state police forensic lab the
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
forensic lab provides services to all
 
04:36:41.330 --> 04:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
local New Hampshire police departments
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
and these positions are required to
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
ensure the accurate and timely
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
processing of evidence that's brought
 
04:36:49.730 --> 04:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
that are brought forward
 
04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's one Sergeant position within
 
04:36:53.390 --> 04:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
State Police Communications which
 
04:36:55.609 --> 04:36:55.619 align:start position:0%
provides oversight over the 24 7 State

Police dispatch function
 
04:37:00.650 --> 04:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
and then on page 16 an administrator 2
 
04:37:02.570 --> 04:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
position which oversees the criminal
 
04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
justice information message switch
 
04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
system this is the piece that we talked
 
04:37:08.330 --> 04:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
about with the doit expenditures that
 
04:37:10.490 --> 04:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
transmits data across the criminal
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
justice system
 
04:37:13.131 --> 04:37:13.141 align:start position:0%
and then we have some new position
 
04:37:15.529 --> 04:37:15.539 align:start position:0%
requests for state police one there's
 
04:37:17.810 --> 04:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
three new criminalist one positions in
 
04:37:21.170 --> 04:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
the lab this is for the forensic biology
 
04:37:23.330 --> 04:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
unit which has not increased its number
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
of full-time positions since 2012.
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
there's been a delay in the turnaround
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
time between the receipt of biology
 
04:37:30.890 --> 04:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
requests in the lab and the issuance of
 
04:37:33.170 --> 04:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
a report and that has continued to
 
04:37:35.449 --> 04:37:35.459 align:start position:0%
Triple due to Staffing concerns we're
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
implementing new technology in this area
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
but also need new positions to ensure
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
that we can maintain existing levels of
 
04:37:44.029 --> 04:37:44.039 align:start position:0%
service and operate that new technology
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
and then in the traffic bureau there's
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
one new program specialist two position
 
04:37:49.609 --> 04:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
to help support the digital evidence
 
04:37:52.369 --> 04:37:52.379 align:start position:0%
unit uh related to the body camera and
 
04:37:53.929 --> 04:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
Cruiser camera data that's currently
 
04:37:55.849 --> 04:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
being collected now that system has been
 
04:37:55.859 --> 04:37:57.230 align:start position:0%
being collected now that system has been
implemented

04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
04:37:58.730 --> 04:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
and then finally what's listed here at
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
the very bottom 1.6 million is 17
 
04:38:04.429 --> 04:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
positions that were previously unfunded
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
in Prior biennium so these were not
 
04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
funded in 22 or 23 but they are
 
04:38:11.269 --> 04:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
positions that are authorized but have
 
04:38:14.769 --> 04:38:14.779 align:start position:0%
been unfunded for several biennium now
 
04:38:17.209 --> 04:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
page 17 is the division of Homeland
 
04:38:19.310 --> 04:38:19.320 align:start position:0%

04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
natural or human-caused disasters
 
04:38:29.869 --> 04:38:29.879 align:start position:0%
on page 18 hsem's FY 24 budget request
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
is 27.3 million dollars their 25 request
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
is 26.9 million dollars
 
04:38:39.709 --> 04:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
26 percent of those funds support the 42
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
classified into unclassified positions
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
the 74 of those costs are operating
 
04:38:47.929 --> 04:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
funds primarily federal grants that are
 
04:38:50.449 --> 04:38:50.459 align:start position:0%
distributed to locals and state agencies
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
as part of the homeland security grant
 
04:38:54.890 --> 04:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
program through FEMA
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
in FY 22 hsem activated the state
 
04:39:00.490 --> 04:39:00.500 align:start position:0%
Emergency Operations Center 10 times
 
04:39:03.410 --> 04:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
facilitated 16 exercises and 67
 
04:39:05.689 --> 04:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
trainings and conducted 31 initial
 
04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
reviews and approved 44 local Hazard
 
04:39:12.789 --> 04:39:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:15.650 --> 04:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
7.4 million dollars of the increase in
 
04:39:18.410 --> 04:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
FY 22 has increased a federal disaster
 
04:39:20.631 --> 04:39:20.641 align:start position:0%
money which will be distributed to State
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
and local disaster responses the
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
majority of that is coming from the
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
covid-19 disasters
 
04:39:29.150 --> 04:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh 78 000 of the increase is a new
 
04:39:31.189 --> 04:39:31.199 align:start position:0%

position
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the radiological instrument
 
04:39:36.529 --> 04:39:36.539 align:start position:0%
maintenance and calibration section and
 
04:39:38.810 --> 04:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
that position is funded 100 by other
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
funds as part of the annual Seabrook
 
04:39:41.868 --> 04:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
station assessment
 
04:39:43.610 --> 04:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
and then there are two positions that
 
04:39:45.530 --> 04:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
are unfunded and listed as prioritized
 
04:39:48.890 --> 04:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
needs which are listed on page 19.

04:42:14.208 --> 04:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
no significant changes to salary and
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
benefits there's actually a decrease in
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
full-time salaries due to new employees
 
04:42:19.610 --> 04:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
that were hired at higher rates than
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
their incumbents but that's being offset
 
04:42:24.530 --> 04:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
by an increase in part-time wages due to
 
04:42:26.208 --> 04:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
increased demand for fire training
 
04:42:29.390 --> 04:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
courses and part-time instructors this
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
division really relies heavily on
 
04:42:32.208 --> 04:42:32.218 align:start position:0%
part-timers for fire training
 
04:42:35.410 --> 04:42:35.420 align:start position:0%
instruction across the state
 
04:42:39.230 --> 04:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
860 000 of the increase uh is due to the
 
04:42:41.030 --> 04:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
increased cost of instructional supplies
 
04:42:43.128 --> 04:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
to meet demands for the classes and
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's in fuel for fire training
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
replacement equipment as well as a new
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
candidate physical ability test trailer
 
04:42:53.448 --> 04:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
there are three new full-time fire
 
04:42:55.010 --> 04:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
service instructor positions in
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs that are unfunded
 
04:42:58.850 --> 04:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
these are required to respond to
 
04:43:00.050 --> 04:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
increased demand for additional

instructional staff that are necessary
 
04:43:09.170 --> 04:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before these programs are
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
primarily taught by part-time
 
04:43:13.670 --> 04:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
instructors and it's been a challenge to
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
find enough part-time instructors to
 
04:43:17.208 --> 04:43:17.218 align:start position:0%

page 26 shows the division's budget
 
04:43:39.770 --> 04:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
request of 4.8 million dollars in FY 24
 
04:43:43.850 --> 04:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
and 4.9 million dollars in fy25
 
04:43:46.250 --> 04:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
82 percent of those funds support salary

division
 
04:43:54.650 --> 04:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
in FY 22 these employees investigated
 
04:43:58.610 --> 04:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
123 fire related incidents conducted 323
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%

04:44:13.368 --> 04:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
000 of the increase from FY 23 is due to
 
04:44:15.368 --> 04:44:15.378 align:start position:0%
increases in replacement equipment
 
04:44:17.390 --> 04:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
including vehicles used by fire
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
investigators when responding to a fire
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
related incident
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
and 105 thousand dollars of the increase
 
04:44:25.250 --> 04:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
are due to increased salary and benefit
 
04:44:26.690 --> 04:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
costs as a result of scheduled
 
04:44:26.700 --> 04:44:28.310 align:start position:0%
costs as a result of scheduled
increments

04:44:28.310 --> 04:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
increments
 
04:44:30.410 --> 04:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
what's important to note here is that
 
04:44:33.650 --> 04:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
the fire fund as it stands which is
 
04:44:35.330 --> 04:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
supported by fees collected for driver
 
04:44:38.270 --> 04:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
history records is not sufficient to
 
04:44:40.368 --> 04:44:40.378 align:start position:0%
fund both the division of fire standards
 
04:44:41.930 --> 04:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
and training and also the division of
 
04:44:44.090 --> 04:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
fire safety and so adjustments are going
 
04:44:47.270 --> 04:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
to be required to ensure that we can
 
04:44:48.830 --> 04:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
continue to support both of these
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
divisions with those funds a combination
 
04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
of expanded authorized use and then
 
04:44:55.850 --> 04:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
updated per record fees will be required
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
in order to alleviate any concerns we
 
04:45:01.850 --> 04:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
have with the fire fund fund balance
 
04:45:04.010 --> 04:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
and there is one new full-time position
 
04:45:05.690 --> 04:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
that's being requested by the division
 
04:45:08.090 --> 04:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
this is a new program Assistant two
 
04:45:09.770 --> 04:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
which is critical for planning
 
04:45:11.628 --> 04:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
organizing and coordinating admin rules
 
04:45:13.610 --> 04:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
and responding to 91a requests because
 
04:45:16.730 --> 04:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
those responses keep increasing
 
04:45:20.030 --> 04:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
um the division received 132 requests in
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
2020 159 and 21 and are on track to
 
04:45:26.990 --> 04:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
receive 197 and 22 and so timely
 
04:45:29.390 --> 04:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
responses required by law and is unable
 
04:45:32.810 --> 04:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
to be met with existing resources
 
04:45:34.850 --> 04:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
and so that concludes a summary of our
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
budget request for 24.25 and be happy to
 
04:45:40.788 --> 04:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh quick question first on on
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
DMV I know DMV has undergone a lot of
 
04:45:48.650 --> 04:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
technological technological changes over
 
04:45:51.170 --> 04:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
the last few years for example being
 
04:45:53.090 --> 04:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
able to renew your license online things
 
04:45:54.170 --> 04:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:45:57.410 --> 04:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
has that manifested itself within your
 
04:46:00.110 --> 04:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
budget as far as budget savings uh for
 
04:46:02.330 --> 04:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
example you know maybe unfunding
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
positions that are currently vacant that
 
04:46:07.010 --> 04:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
would that have been made sort of
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
redundant by these technological
 
04:46:09.840 --> 04:46:11.510 align:start position:0%
redundant by these technological
advances

04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
advances
 
04:46:14.570 --> 04:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh no there hasn't really been an
 
04:46:16.250 --> 04:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
um to eliminate positions it's it's
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
really more of a a convenience factor
 
04:46:22.320 --> 04:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
really more of a a convenience factor
for

04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:46:25.010 --> 04:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
um for the public
 
04:46:26.270 --> 04:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
um so they don't have to wait in line
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to schedule an appointment or
 
04:46:29.570 --> 04:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
able to renew certain things online
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
there's also there is somewhat of a
 
04:46:33.288 --> 04:46:33.298 align:start position:0%
shift because there's still back office
 
04:46:35.150 --> 04:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
work that has to happen associated with
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
all those transactions
 
04:46:38.810 --> 04:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
um and so while there may be less
 
04:46:42.050 --> 04:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
positions for front desk related
 
04:46:43.970 --> 04:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
activities because of less people coming
 
04:46:43.980 --> 04:46:45.050 align:start position:0%
activities because of less people coming
in

04:46:45.050 --> 04:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
um there's still work that has to occur
 
04:46:48.288 --> 04:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
and it's just moved to a back office
 
04:46:51.410 --> 04:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
function okay number one priority State
 
04:46:51.420 --> 04:46:53.330 align:start position:0%
function okay number one priority State
Police

04:46:53.330 --> 04:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
Police
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
as far as as far as funding the the the
 
04:46:57.410 --> 04:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions you have right now
 
04:46:59.270 --> 04:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
that remains your number one uh
 
04:47:02.090 --> 04:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
additional prioritizing the the Troopers
 
04:47:04.970 --> 04:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah the Troopers number one
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
um it's uh now let the commissioner
 
04:47:08.810 --> 04:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
speak to that more but it's essentially
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
maintaining Public Safety Services
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
um very dedicated Force they've been
 
04:47:16.610 --> 04:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
doing it with um with less folks due to
 
04:47:16.620 --> 04:47:17.990 align:start position:0%
doing it with um with less folks due to
vacancies

04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
04:47:19.910 --> 04:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
um we're having success attracting
 
04:47:22.850 --> 04:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
people now uh the Market's starting to
 
04:47:25.788 --> 04:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
change that's my next question is
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I know that the state has instituted
 
04:47:30.170 --> 04:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
an incentive program for you to hire uh
 
04:47:32.868 --> 04:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
more state troopers and
 
04:47:34.490 --> 04:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
um if you could comment a little bit
 
04:47:36.530 --> 04:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
about how successful that program has
 
04:47:40.550 --> 04:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
been and where you see it going uh
 
04:47:43.490 --> 04:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
you know assuming we fund a lot of these
 
04:47:45.530 --> 04:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
unfunded currently unfunded positions
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question I I
 
04:47:49.070 --> 04:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
think the Recruitment and the retention
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
bonuses are definitely something that
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
will benefit uh in the short and the
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
long term and
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
our most recent testing uh was a lot
 
04:48:02.810 --> 04:48:02.820 align:start position:0%
more promising we had more showing up we
 
04:48:05.330 --> 04:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
had a better class we monitor that very
 
04:48:08.208 --> 04:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
closely so I think that that has
 
04:48:09.890 --> 04:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
definitely been a step in the right
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
direction and they that is our our
 
04:48:15.770 --> 04:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
number one priority okay
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
um do you have any sort of projections
 
04:48:20.090 --> 04:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
that are on the on the given the current
 
04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
landscape how many additional Troopers
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
you think you're able to get prior to
 
04:48:27.410 --> 04:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
the end of this current fiscal year or
 
04:48:31.150 --> 04:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:31.160 --> 04:48:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:48:35.330 --> 04:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
I I can't give an exact number now but
 
04:48:37.250 --> 04:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
but what I will say is
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
um by the time if we bring in if we have
 
04:48:42.350 --> 04:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
a test and say at the test the the
 
04:48:45.288 --> 04:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
physical and the written test we get you
 
04:48:47.448 --> 04:48:47.458 align:start position:0%
know 50 pass rate then that we have to
 
04:48:49.368 --> 04:48:49.378 align:start position:0%
go through the the rest of the process
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
which is an oral interview and the
 
04:48:53.810 --> 04:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
testing the polygraph Etc
 
04:48:53.820 --> 04:48:54.708 align:start position:0%
testing the polygraph Etc
um

04:48:54.708 --> 04:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:57.770 --> 04:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
but like I said the last class
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
we had 20
 
04:49:00.600 --> 04:49:01.788 align:start position:0%
we had 20
that

04:49:01.788 --> 04:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
took the test and 12 went on from there
 
04:49:07.490 --> 04:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
to the next step so that that looked
 
04:49:10.550 --> 04:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
promising compared to other classes okay
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
if if you for example were to hire 20
 
04:49:18.170 --> 04:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
between now and June 30th is that would
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
I take the six I believe the 69
 
04:49:23.090 --> 04:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
positions you want funded and subtracted
 
04:49:25.490 --> 04:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
20 from that or is that the 69 positions
 
04:49:28.128 --> 04:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
plus whatever you hire
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
well I think any any time we hire we're
 
04:49:32.270 --> 04:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
subtracting them so we would
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
automatically subtract those so yeah
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
there I I could say this they're working
 
04:49:40.010 --> 04:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
very hard in the recruitment side and um
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
it is their top priority in the state
 
04:49:43.368 --> 04:49:43.378 align:start position:0%
police but
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
um but I'm I'm confident in the team
 
04:49:47.330 --> 04:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
that they have over there that they're
 
04:49:49.610 --> 04:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
doing everything possible and the
 
04:49:51.530 --> 04:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
measures that have taken place uh
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
already I think are going to help okay
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
04:50:00.170 --> 04:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.180 --> 04:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
yep

04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:50:01.920 --> 04:50:03.110 align:start position:0%
yep
um

04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
so you want excuse me you won funded 81
 
04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
positions and that which is and I'm
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
going to ask about that just because
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's unusual nobody else is
 
04:50:14.330 --> 04:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
unfunding positions um they're mostly
 
04:50:16.128 --> 04:50:16.138 align:start position:0%
refunding positions
 
04:50:19.610 --> 04:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:19.620 --> 04:50:21.288 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:50:21.288 --> 04:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:50:23.208 --> 04:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
uh none of them were filled at the time
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the budget development
 
04:50:27.890 --> 04:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
um some of them may be filled now we
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
have not stopped recruiting and so um
 
04:50:33.470 --> 04:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
the positions were were unfunded to meet
 
04:50:36.288 --> 04:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
the revenue targets that we had at the
 
04:50:37.730 --> 04:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
time and that was the only way that we
 
04:50:40.628 --> 04:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
could achieve those targets
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
so most agencies started with their with
 
04:50:46.730 --> 04:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
their positions and then you know to the
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
extent that they didn't do anything
 
04:50:49.430 --> 04:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
different they didn't
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
didn't do it on the people side what why
 
04:50:53.930 --> 04:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
is I'm looking at your budget and you're
 
04:50:55.610 --> 04:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
you're actually less people than most
 
04:50:58.490 --> 04:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
parts of the budget are
 
04:51:01.550 --> 04:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
um you know you're 55 60 percent
 
04:51:04.190 --> 04:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
people is it is it the nature of where
 
04:51:06.530 --> 04:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
those people are I mean I know 90 of
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
your general funds I say police and is
 
04:51:10.550 --> 04:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
it is that what it comes down to or yeah
 
04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's exactly what it is so the state
 
04:51:16.250 --> 04:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
police division is funded um by a mix of
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
General Highway Turnpike funds
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
um general fund increases were allowed
 
04:51:24.288 --> 04:51:24.298 align:start position:0%
Turnpike Highway funds were not there
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
weren't other areas that we could that
 
04:51:28.550 --> 04:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
we could find savings without
 
04:51:30.890 --> 04:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
significantly impacting the the
 
04:51:30.900 --> 04:51:33.170 align:start position:0%
significantly impacting the the
operations

04:51:33.170 --> 04:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
operations
 
04:51:33.180 --> 04:51:34.690 align:start position:0%
operations
okay

04:51:34.690 --> 04:51:34.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:51:37.610 --> 04:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
and does every Trooper position come
 
04:51:39.050 --> 04:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
with a car
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
when we project we include the car the
 
04:51:43.368 --> 04:51:43.378 align:start position:0%
radio everything that's right man and so
 
04:51:44.810 --> 04:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
what are the
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
what's the other stuff cost
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know salary benefits and then you
 
04:51:51.890 --> 04:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
know the car and stuff
 
04:51:56.208 --> 04:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
uh so so the the cars um we budget for a
 
04:51:57.708 --> 04:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
fully outfitted car
 
04:52:00.410 --> 04:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at high 40s
 
04:52:00.420 --> 04:52:01.490 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at high 40s
okay

04:52:01.490 --> 04:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
and so they is there anything else they
 
04:52:06.288 --> 04:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
get like that or is that that's all in
 
04:52:07.910 --> 04:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
that includes the computer and
 
04:52:09.050 --> 04:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
everything else yeah if you want to if
 
04:52:11.690 --> 04:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
you want to round out to 50 for
 
04:52:15.170 --> 04:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
um computer equipment uniform vehicle
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle upfit all those components
 
04:52:18.480 --> 04:52:22.430 align:start position:0%
vehicle upfit all those components
great

04:52:22.430 --> 04:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
so along the same lines of your your
 
04:52:26.330 --> 04:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
triple positions
 
04:52:26.340 --> 04:52:26.990 align:start position:0%
triple positions
um

04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
does your federal or other sources of
 
04:52:31.250 --> 04:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
income uh
 
04:52:33.708 --> 04:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
will that cover any additional Staffing
 
04:52:35.750 --> 04:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
or is most of your Staffing going to
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
then be generally generally funded like
 
04:52:38.810 --> 04:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how your federal grants
 
04:52:40.250 --> 04:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
work in your Trooper area in federal
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
money that comes in but does are you at
 
04:52:43.730 --> 04:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
a fixed Federal amount or do you do you
 
04:52:44.570 --> 04:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
have more Troopers can you have
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
additional Federal money that comes in
 
04:52:48.650 --> 04:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
to help offset some of the costs
 
04:52:50.090 --> 04:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
um right now we're pretty much at a
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
fixed Federal amount for the federally
 
04:52:53.930 --> 04:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
funded positions
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
um the risk is the maintenance of effort
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
requirements associated with those law
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement activities and not being
 
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
able to meet the state portion which
 
04:53:03.410 --> 04:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
puts those federally funded positions
 
04:53:09.890 --> 04:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:15.288 --> 04:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:17.090 --> 04:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
you'd like to invite officer
 
04:53:19.070 --> 04:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
04:53:59.330 --> 04:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:59.340 --> 04:54:03.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:54:03.410 --> 04:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:30.670 --> 04:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:37.200 --> 04:54:45.708 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:54:45.708 --> 04:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:49.730 --> 04:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
I think we're ready great
 
04:54:51.890 --> 04:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh well thank you first off my name is
 
04:54:53.208 --> 04:54:53.218 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Courtney I'm the executive
 
04:54:55.070 --> 04:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
director of The Office Professional Ace
 
04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
insurance certification and with me I
 
04:54:59.448 --> 04:54:59.458 align:start position:0%
have Heather Kelly who's our director of
 
04:55:02.090 --> 04:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
operations and we certainly appreciate
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak with you today
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
regarding oplc's FY 24 and 25 budget
 
04:55:10.128 --> 04:55:10.138 align:start position:0%
requests I wanted to start off on page
 
04:55:13.368 --> 04:55:13.378 align:start position:0%
two with just a brief agency a review I
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
know most of you are probably familiar
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
with the agency although we have seen
 
04:55:19.730 --> 04:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
some significant organizational changes
 
04:55:19.740 --> 04:55:20.868 align:start position:0%
some significant organizational changes
recently

04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
recently
 
04:55:23.390 --> 04:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
we ever see the administration of 50
 
04:55:25.490 --> 04:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing boards seven of
 
04:55:27.288 --> 04:55:27.298 align:start position:0%
those are directly regulated by the
 
04:55:29.050 --> 04:55:29.060 align:start position:0%
office itself
 
04:55:31.550 --> 04:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
while we are a fairly new agency
 
04:55:34.970 --> 04:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
established in 2015 the boards are not
 
04:55:38.150 --> 04:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
new and oblc's task has been to
 
04:55:40.070 --> 04:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
consolidate all administrative functions
 
04:55:43.128 --> 04:55:43.138 align:start position:0%
into one regulatory body
 
04:55:45.590 --> 04:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
the second bullet point on page two
 
04:55:47.208 --> 04:55:47.218 align:start position:0%
highlights some of our key licensure
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
data and certainly more is available in
 
04:55:52.010 --> 04:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
our annual reports with a licensee pool
 
04:55:54.410 --> 04:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
that equals the size of 16 of the
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
state's population oplc's operations
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
certainly significantly impact Workforce
 
04:56:02.690 --> 04:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
in this state and so our budget our
 
04:56:05.030 --> 04:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
proposed budget was designed to fully
 
04:56:07.070 --> 04:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
resource the agency to ensure it is able
 
04:56:09.770 --> 04:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
to timely respond to Workforce needs
 
04:56:12.170 --> 04:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
the third bullet point
 
04:56:15.170 --> 04:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
um details our personnel
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
positions that we have currently we have
 
04:56:20.208 --> 04:56:20.218 align:start position:0%
82 permanent classified positions in
 
04:56:22.070 --> 04:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
addition to that we presently have 19
 
04:56:24.650 --> 04:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary positions we are
 
04:56:27.830 --> 04:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
requesting uh that we that we convert
 
04:56:30.110 --> 04:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
six of those to permanent positions in
 
04:56:31.610 --> 04:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
04:56:33.708 --> 04:56:33.718 align:start position:0%
um essentially we're anticipating that
 
04:56:36.890 --> 04:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
as we move from an a manual Personnel
 
04:56:39.050 --> 04:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
driven process to an electronic process
 
04:56:41.448 --> 04:56:41.458 align:start position:0%
we will be able to
 
04:56:43.368 --> 04:56:43.378 align:start position:0%
um unfund some of those positions
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
through attrition and at present we only
 
04:56:48.770 --> 04:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
have three vacant positions including
 
04:56:51.650 --> 04:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
the 19 full-time temporary
 
04:56:53.570 --> 04:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
on page three I just wanted to touch
 
04:56:56.208 --> 04:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
briefly on our vision which which guided
 
04:56:59.570 --> 04:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
our proposal today our licensing boards
 
04:57:02.090 --> 04:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
have for years operated with very
 
04:57:04.490 --> 04:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
rudimentary manual processes which has
 
04:57:05.930 --> 04:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
created significant barriers to
 
04:57:05.940 --> 04:57:07.070 align:start position:0%
created significant barriers to
Workforce

04:57:07.070 --> 04:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
04:57:09.530 --> 04:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
so our vision is really to transform and
 
04:57:11.868 --> 04:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
modernize support for New Hampshire's
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing boards we propose
 
04:57:16.010 --> 04:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
to do this over the next several years
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
by shifting from a manual Personnel
 
04:57:20.690 --> 04:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
driven process to streamlined electronic
 
04:57:20.700 --> 04:57:22.250 align:start position:0%
driven process to streamlined electronic
processes

04:57:22.250 --> 04:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
processes
 
04:57:24.948 --> 04:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
and our budget was designed to help the
 
04:57:27.170 --> 04:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
agency achieve its vision mission and
 
04:57:28.788 --> 04:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
strategic goals which were captured more
 
04:57:30.650 --> 04:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
fully in our strategic plan which you
 
04:57:33.170 --> 04:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
also have a copy of
 
04:57:35.050 --> 04:57:35.060 align:start position:0%
on page four
 
04:57:39.230 --> 04:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
we provide some objectives contained
 
04:57:41.990 --> 04:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
within our agency budgets and designing
 
04:57:44.090 --> 04:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
our proposed budget we focused on our
 
04:57:47.288 --> 04:57:47.298 align:start position:0%
strategic goals for FY 23 fy25
 
04:57:50.270 --> 04:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
among other things we we want to
 
04:57:52.010 --> 04:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
increase licensure portability and
 
04:57:53.810 --> 04:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
enhance customer service by leveraging
 
04:57:56.270 --> 04:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
technology as well as continue to focus
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
on establishing internal controls
 
04:58:01.010 --> 04:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
throughout the agency and for the boards
 
04:58:03.470 --> 04:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
how are we going to pay for our proposed
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
budget which I believe stands at about
 
04:58:09.350 --> 04:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
15.1 million dollars in FY 24. as you
 
04:58:12.770 --> 04:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
know oplc is a self-funded agency its
 
04:58:16.270 --> 04:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
revenue must not exceed 125 of its costs
 
04:58:19.970 --> 04:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
but we are proposing a budget uh that
 
04:58:19.980 --> 04:58:21.650 align:start position:0%
but we are proposing a budget uh that
essentially

04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
04:58:24.890 --> 04:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
um would result in a minimal elapse to
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
the general fund in other words our
 
04:58:29.090 --> 04:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
proposed budget does propose an increase
 
04:58:31.010 --> 04:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
in expenditures but the budget would be
 
04:58:33.410 --> 04:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
fully funded by existing revenues for
 
04:58:36.190 --> 04:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
not anticipating an increase in revenues
 
04:58:38.868 --> 04:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
but just to fully fund the budget with
 
04:58:41.330 --> 04:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
existing revenues
 
04:58:44.270 --> 04:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
on page five
 
04:58:46.970 --> 04:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
we provide a summary of our budget
 
04:58:46.980 --> 04:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
we provide a summary of our budget
requests

04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
requests
 
04:58:50.690 --> 04:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
we are proposing to modernize operations
 
04:58:53.150 --> 04:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
by leveraging technology in a few ways
 
04:58:55.368 --> 04:58:55.378 align:start position:0%
we'd like to transition to a fully
 
04:58:57.410 --> 04:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
electronic customer driven licensing
 
04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
portal this would virtually eliminate
 
04:59:02.090 --> 04:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
oplc's receipt of incomplete
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
applications we estimate our receipt
 
04:59:07.550 --> 04:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
right now is about 95 percent which
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
would result in a significantly
 
04:59:10.490 --> 04:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
decreased licensure time frames
 
04:59:12.350 --> 04:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
obviously the eliminating barriers to
 
04:59:12.360 --> 04:59:13.670 align:start position:0%
obviously the eliminating barriers to
Workforce

04:59:13.670 --> 04:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
04:59:15.410 --> 04:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
a new portal would also provide the
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
state with access to important necessary
 
04:59:19.250 --> 04:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
data for Workforce analysis data that we
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
don't presently have across the state
 
04:59:23.288 --> 04:59:23.298 align:start position:0%
and there's I'm not aware of any other
 
04:59:26.570 --> 04:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
agency that's able to compile that data
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
we are already working with stakeholders
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
to understand the important data
 
04:59:31.128 --> 04:59:31.138 align:start position:0%
elements and we're currently
 
04:59:33.470 --> 04:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
promulgating rules right now on behalf
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
of the agency to streamline licensing
 
04:59:38.448 --> 04:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
procedures in anticipation of
 
04:59:41.150 --> 04:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
procurement you should know also that
 
04:59:45.110 --> 04:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
doit did receive we worked with doit to
 
04:59:46.930 --> 04:59:46.940 align:start position:0%
procure arpa dollars for this purpose
 
04:59:50.448 --> 04:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
but we do require continued support of
 
04:59:52.670 --> 04:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
our business analysts that are presently
 
04:59:56.270 --> 04:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh temporary full-time positions in
 
04:59:57.550 --> 04:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
order to
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
proceed with the procurement and
 
05:00:01.550 --> 05:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
implementation of a new system
 
05:00:04.368 --> 05:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
we are also proposing to transition to a
 
05:00:05.930 --> 05:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
fully electronic customer driven
 
05:00:08.690 --> 05:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
continuing education tracking portal
 
05:00:11.510 --> 05:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
um just to give you every part of oplc's
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
processes that were created by the
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
boards many years ago was was governed
 
05:00:18.770 --> 05:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
required a person to actually take a
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
step we are trying to transition
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
completely away from that and have the
 
05:00:25.128 --> 05:00:25.138 align:start position:0%
user essentially guide themselves
 
05:00:29.570 --> 05:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:32.690 --> 05:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm pH six
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
just an overview of establishing
 
05:00:36.890 --> 05:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
internal controls how we're going to do
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
that through the budget obviously to
 
05:00:40.610 --> 05:00:40.620 align:start position:0%
leverage technology appropriately we
 
05:00:42.288 --> 05:00:42.298 align:start position:0%
have to have internal controls in place
 
05:00:44.570 --> 05:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
as many of you know this has been a
 
05:00:47.208 --> 05:00:47.218 align:start position:0%
significant challenge for the agency
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
um it almost would have been easier I
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
think if the boards if we had just
 
05:00:51.970 --> 05:00:51.980 align:start position:0%
started fresh
 
05:00:55.368 --> 05:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to fix everything that
 
05:00:58.250 --> 05:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
has been going on for years boards
 
05:00:59.628 --> 05:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
created their own ways of doing business
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
for many years they operated as their
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
own fiefdoms establishing internal
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
controls requires significant support
 
05:01:07.250 --> 05:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
and a change in the culture that is
 
05:01:09.770 --> 05:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
supportive to be supportive of complying
 
05:01:12.250 --> 05:01:12.260 align:start position:0%
with the law we presently have
 
05:01:14.930 --> 05:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
established temporary full-time
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
positions to your attorneys and
 
05:01:19.070 --> 05:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
administrator one who is our internal
 
05:01:21.070 --> 05:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
controls administrator
 
05:01:24.070 --> 05:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
who are absolutely necessary to continue
 
05:01:27.170 --> 05:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
to put internal controls in place and so
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
we are seeking to convert those
 
05:01:31.430 --> 05:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
permanent positions to full-time so
 
05:01:33.170 --> 05:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
that's what you see the increase on last
 
05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
in class 10 primarily that's on page
 
05:01:39.430 --> 05:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
nine of our agency budget book we also
 
05:01:41.930 --> 05:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
anticipate a slight increase in class 26
 
05:01:44.090 --> 05:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
for organizational dues we are statutory
 
05:01:45.770 --> 05:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
required to participate and they're
 
05:01:48.890 --> 05:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
based on our licensing numbers which we
 
05:01:50.810 --> 05:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
do anticipate to go up a little bit
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully if we have increased Workforce
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
with class 46 we are proposing a fairly
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
significant increase in Consultants what
 
05:02:02.448 --> 05:02:02.458 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is get away from
 
05:02:05.330 --> 05:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
board members conducting business on
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
their own on behalf of the boards into
 
05:02:10.970 --> 05:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship with expert
 
05:02:13.490 --> 05:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
Consultants so that we can better manage
 
05:02:16.610 --> 05:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
the course of their conduct and ensure
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
compliance so that's where we're
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
proposing a raise or an increase to
 
05:02:24.288 --> 05:02:24.298 align:start position:0%
class 46 and then a slight increase to
 
05:02:27.170 --> 05:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
class 66 for staff training and
 
05:02:27.180 --> 05:02:28.270 align:start position:0%
class 66 for staff training and
education

05:02:28.270 --> 05:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
we would we have developed a board
 
05:02:34.128 --> 05:02:34.138 align:start position:0%
member training portals we would like to
 
05:02:35.930 --> 05:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
encourage board members to participate
 
05:02:37.970 --> 05:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
but at least we can control staff and so
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
we would propose staff training and
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
education in order to promote compliance
 
05:02:45.410 --> 05:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
um a couple of other things as outlined
 
05:02:48.350 --> 05:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
on page nine of the agency budget book I
 
05:02:51.430 --> 05:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
would just want to note that class 30
 
05:02:55.670 --> 05:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
the increase in equipment new and
 
05:02:57.708 --> 05:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
replacement that is primarily for
 
05:03:00.410 --> 05:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
vehicles we actually may be able to
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
purchase those Vehicles this year it was
 
05:03:04.730 --> 05:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
unclear whether or not we'd have
 
05:03:06.770 --> 05:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
inventory so at the time of establishing
 
05:03:08.208 --> 05:03:08.218 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
05:03:13.250 --> 05:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
um we proposed uh to increase that line
 
05:03:16.910 --> 05:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
item you also see class 531 impaired
 
05:03:20.990 --> 05:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
programs that is a statutorily required
 
05:03:24.948 --> 05:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
program that we are required to contract
 
05:03:27.410 --> 05:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
for specific to nursing but we can also
 
05:03:29.890 --> 05:03:29.900 align:start position:0%
offer it for dentists and pharmacists
 
05:03:33.170 --> 05:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
this went out to bed and the contract
 
05:03:35.090 --> 05:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
price is located there there's also a
 
05:03:37.368 --> 05:03:37.378 align:start position:0%
separate dedicated fund and we raise
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
fees specific for that purpose for those
 
05:03:42.530 --> 05:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
license professions and then finally
 
05:03:45.610 --> 05:03:45.620 align:start position:0%
will see an increase in our lease to
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
capture the amendment to our lease that
 
05:03:50.750 --> 05:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
was approved last year through governor
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
and Council
 
05:03:54.410 --> 05:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for your time I'm
 
05:03:57.050 --> 05:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
05:04:00.410 --> 05:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
on the use of Consultants does does the
 
05:04:05.448 --> 05:04:05.458 align:start position:0%
increased use of Consultants
 
05:04:09.350 --> 05:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
have a direct impact on the
 
05:04:09.360 --> 05:04:10.190 align:start position:0%
have a direct impact on the
um

05:04:10.190 --> 05:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:11.628 --> 05:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
maybe the
 
05:04:14.390 --> 05:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
operation of the boards they're hiring
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
do they they tend to make these boards
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
less relevant
 
05:04:18.240 --> 05:04:20.350 align:start position:0%
less relevant
foreign

05:04:20.350 --> 05:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
yes I think that's true
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I think what we found though is is
 
05:04:26.270 --> 05:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
over the years when boards have taken
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
upon themselves to perform all functions
 
05:04:30.770 --> 05:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
be judged jury and executioner that
 
05:04:32.810 --> 05:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
there are issues with that
 
05:04:34.670 --> 05:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
um and we'd like to professionalize with
 
05:04:36.410 --> 05:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
our Workforce and the board members
 
05:04:38.930 --> 05:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
leverage the board members for their
 
05:04:40.670 --> 05:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
expertise but solely for their expertise
 
05:04:42.650 --> 05:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
and their professions and not for their
 
05:04:45.590 --> 05:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
for their assistance with administrative
 
05:04:45.600 --> 05:04:46.970 align:start position:0%
for their assistance with administrative
functions

05:04:46.970 --> 05:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
functions
 
05:04:49.310 --> 05:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and and one of the
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
questions I noticed that uh as a line
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
item the the rent it's rent leases other
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
than state has been up and down pretty
 
05:04:59.330 --> 05:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
much you can just take me through why
 
05:05:01.490 --> 05:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's it's gone from 500 0003 and back
 
05:05:03.050 --> 05:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
up to 750 and I don't know if you could
 
05:05:05.090 --> 05:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
take me why that
 
05:05:08.030 --> 05:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
major operating expenses the second line
 
05:05:11.628 --> 05:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
it's down are you in a department
 
05:05:14.030 --> 05:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
summary okay
 
05:05:14.040 --> 05:05:30.470 align:start position:0%
summary okay
okay

05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:30.480 --> 05:05:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:05:34.910 --> 05:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
got it runs Lisa's other than State yes
 
05:05:36.770 --> 05:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
um so what happened is we were in Phil
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
Brook which was a state-owned facility
 
05:05:40.730 --> 05:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
05:05:40.740 --> 05:05:41.590 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
um

05:05:41.590 --> 05:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:44.510 --> 05:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS needed our building so we vacated
 
05:05:47.090 --> 05:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
the building we procured a portion of
 
05:05:48.770 --> 05:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
the building that we're in now which was
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
not sufficient but it was what was
 
05:05:53.330 --> 05:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
available so we executed part of the
 
05:05:56.208 --> 05:05:56.218 align:start position:0%
lease that was up you know it was
 
05:05:56.218 --> 05:05:57.770 align:start position:0%
lease that was up you know it was
approximately

05:05:57.770 --> 05:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
05:06:01.368 --> 05:06:01.378 align:start position:0%
I think it was 393 000 and then we
 
05:06:03.708 --> 05:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
prepared another part of that space once
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
Deloitte vacated that we went to fiscal
 
05:06:08.990 --> 05:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and so FY 22 that represents the
 
05:06:11.390 --> 05:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
entirety of the lease except but we only
 
05:06:13.368 --> 05:06:13.378 align:start position:0%
paid for half of the building for a
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
certain portion of the year we do need
 
05:06:19.310 --> 05:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal for FY 23 in order to
 
05:06:22.970 --> 05:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
pay for our our lease which totals
 
05:06:25.250 --> 05:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
approximately 751 and that's what we've
 
05:06:27.230 --> 05:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
asked for okay great thank you you're
 
05:06:27.240 --> 05:06:28.970 align:start position:0%
asked for okay great thank you you're
welcome

05:06:28.970 --> 05:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
05:06:31.910 --> 05:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:31.920 --> 05:06:45.410 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:06:45.410 --> 05:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:47.810 --> 05:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
that's been an ongoing challenge I can
 
05:06:49.550 --> 05:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
let Heather speak to that a little bit
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
better it's part of our establishing
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
so we are using activity codes for each
 
05:06:58.850 --> 05:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
board to establish where the expenses
 
05:07:01.610 --> 05:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
are currently going uh some activity
 
05:07:03.970 --> 05:07:03.980 align:start position:0%
codes are not using used appropriately
 
05:07:06.110 --> 05:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
and expense classes were not used
 
05:07:08.270 --> 05:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately so we have adjusted
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
internal controls to make sure expenses
 
05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
are being allocated appropriately to the
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
board there were some expenses were
 
05:07:17.690 --> 05:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
being allocated to the agency instead of
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:21.840 --> 05:07:42.850 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:07:42.850 --> 05:07:42.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:46.190 --> 05:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
we changed our allocation method last
 
05:07:46.200 --> 05:07:47.448 align:start position:0%
we changed our allocation method last
year

05:07:47.448 --> 05:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:07:49.910 --> 05:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
um the allocation method used to be
 
05:07:52.128 --> 05:07:52.138 align:start position:0%
based on Revenue which really made sense
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
to me that percentage of Revenue brought
 
05:07:56.570 --> 05:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
in we'd allocate a certain amount of
 
05:07:59.270 --> 05:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
that percentage of costs back to the
 
05:07:59.280 --> 05:08:00.110 align:start position:0%
that percentage of costs back to the
board

05:08:00.110 --> 05:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:08:02.930 --> 05:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
we are proposing to allocate or we do
 
05:08:02.940 --> 05:08:04.250 align:start position:0%
we are proposing to allocate or we do
allocate

05:08:04.250 --> 05:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
allocate
 
05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
um shared costs to the boards based on
 
05:08:06.958 --> 05:08:08.990 align:start position:0%
um shared costs to the boards based on
licensees

05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
05:08:11.868 --> 05:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
um but license number the idea being
 
05:08:14.208 --> 05:08:14.218 align:start position:0%
that every licensee has access to the
 
05:08:15.708 --> 05:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
same services
 
05:08:18.050 --> 05:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
we there was a whole committee this year
 
05:08:19.910 --> 05:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
designed to look at our allocation
 
05:08:21.770 --> 05:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
method as well as our fee so it's a
 
05:08:25.490 --> 05:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
South try SB 330. the problem is if you
 
05:08:27.170 --> 05:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
have you know the concern we have is if
 
05:08:30.050 --> 05:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
you allocate you know particular cost of
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
a prosecution to a board your fees are
 
05:08:34.250 --> 05:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
going to go up and down and very
 
05:08:36.948 --> 05:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
significantly so the idea is that if we
 
05:08:39.530 --> 05:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
charge on a per licensee basis for
 
05:08:42.890 --> 05:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
shared costs then it's pretty consistent
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
um we have been working with the
 
05:08:46.250 --> 05:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
governor's office not
 
05:08:48.530 --> 05:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
um decided to put a hold on modifying
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
any fees if you look at our annual
 
05:08:53.208 --> 05:08:53.218 align:start position:0%
report you'll see that board revenue is
 
05:08:55.788 --> 05:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
all over the place in terms of that 125
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
Mark some are are making it some are
 
05:09:00.590 --> 05:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
significantly exceeding it some are not
 
05:09:02.650 --> 05:09:02.660 align:start position:0%
making meeting costs
 
05:09:06.230 --> 05:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
after the
 
05:09:07.970 --> 05:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
um work with the committee established
 
05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
by Senate Bill 330. once we got some
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
clarification we do anticipate moving
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
forward with some some rule changes to
 
05:09:17.930 --> 05:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone is is not greater
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
no it's it's this one over here
 
05:09:49.970 --> 05:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
um that um oh good
 
05:09:49.980 --> 05:09:50.868 align:start position:0%
um that um oh good
um

05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:52.850 --> 05:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
and I worry about that and I remember at
 
05:09:54.530 --> 05:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
one point it was I don't even know
 
05:09:57.110 --> 05:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
Architects somebody was paying like 700
 
05:09:59.448 --> 05:09:59.458 align:start position:0%
percent their fees covered 700 of
 
05:10:01.368 --> 05:10:01.378 align:start position:0%
expenses and
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
right at some point if I'm an architect
 
05:10:07.070 --> 05:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
why don't I sue for my money back
 
05:10:09.650 --> 05:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
yes that's been our concern as well
 
05:10:11.750 --> 05:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
um one could make the argument some are
 
05:10:13.850 --> 05:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
paying way more than they should raising
 
05:10:18.050 --> 05:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
tax implications which is why we
 
05:10:19.730 --> 05:10:19.740 align:start position:0%
um have for the past three years tried
 
05:10:21.288 --> 05:10:21.298 align:start position:0%
to move forward with legislation that
 
05:10:23.570 --> 05:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
would allow us to make sure everybody is
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
less than 125 percent this budget is
 
05:10:28.970 --> 05:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
really designed to be 100 budget um the
 
05:10:31.010 --> 05:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
feedback we got from the legislative
 
05:10:33.530 --> 05:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
committee on 330 was that 125 we don't
 
05:10:36.650 --> 05:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
need to be near 125 percent
 
05:10:39.530 --> 05:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
um because we we're not functioning the
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
way we used to and that we need to keep
 
05:10:42.170 --> 05:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money in the bank so
 
05:10:46.190 --> 05:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
do you publish annual data yes uh
 
05:10:47.750 --> 05:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
through our annual report our most
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
recent one was released November 1st
 
05:10:51.770 --> 05:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
it's on our website oh and so it'll show
 
05:10:54.350 --> 05:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
like if I'm an architect I hate to pick
 
05:10:55.970 --> 05:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
on Architects
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
um but I'm an architect and go oh
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're collecting 116 percent
 
05:11:01.970 --> 05:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
yes I can tell you cosmetology is
 
05:11:04.368 --> 05:11:04.378 align:start position:0%
probably at 46 and there are some that
 
05:11:06.170 --> 05:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
are about 200
 
05:11:07.550 --> 05:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see that in our annual
 
05:11:09.050 --> 05:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
report well that's a better range a few
 
05:11:11.448 --> 05:11:11.458 align:start position:0%
years back somebody was at 700. so yeah
 
05:11:13.990 --> 05:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
no we don't have any 700s
 
05:11:17.448 --> 05:11:17.458 align:start position:0%
outstanding as long as the CPA Group is
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
not at the 200 percent I'm okay with
 
05:11:19.320 --> 05:11:20.390 align:start position:0%
not at the 200 percent I'm okay with
that

05:11:20.390 --> 05:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:20.400 --> 05:11:26.570 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:20:38.270 --> 05:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
with the emphasis on hiring new police
 
05:20:40.610 --> 05:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
officers not only we just had the
 
05:20:42.350 --> 05:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
department of safety and in talking with
 
05:20:43.788 --> 05:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
with their Trooper requests but
 
05:20:45.890 --> 05:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
obviously municipalities are going
 
05:20:47.868 --> 05:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
through a lot of the same problems that
 
05:20:50.650 --> 05:20:50.660 align:start position:0%
the state is having
 
05:20:53.690 --> 05:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
assuming that they are able to meet
 
05:20:56.890 --> 05:20:56.900 align:start position:0%
their hiring goals does this budget
 
05:20:59.330 --> 05:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
reflect do you have enough money in this
 
05:21:01.250 --> 05:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
budget to be able to train those people
 
05:21:03.708 --> 05:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
that they want to hire the additional
 
05:21:06.590 --> 05:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
people that they want to hire
 
05:21:06.600 --> 05:21:09.288 align:start position:0%
people that they want to hire
no

05:21:09.288 --> 05:21:09.298 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:21:12.948 --> 05:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
okay I think it's important for uh this
 
05:21:15.288 --> 05:21:15.298 align:start position:0%
committee to recognize that uh because
 
05:21:17.930 --> 05:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
of Recruitment and Retention issues that
 
05:21:21.410 --> 05:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
have really manifest themselves in uh
 
05:21:25.070 --> 05:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
this year where we really saw a push and
 
05:21:27.470 --> 05:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
really almost at the beginning of this
 
05:21:27.480 --> 05:21:28.270 align:start position:0%
really almost at the beginning of this
year

05:21:28.270 --> 05:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:21:31.670 --> 05:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
I actually went to uh police answer
 
05:21:35.330 --> 05:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
training Council to ask permission to
 
05:21:38.448 --> 05:21:38.458 align:start position:0%
run overlapping police academies and
 
05:21:40.128 --> 05:21:40.138 align:start position:0%
increase the number of academies that
 
05:21:44.570 --> 05:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
we're delivering so that uh the choke
 
05:21:47.390 --> 05:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
point was not at police Sanders and
 
05:21:49.628 --> 05:21:49.638 align:start position:0%
training to get those new officers
 
05:21:52.610 --> 05:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
hired through their training and then
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
back to their their home agencies uh
 
05:21:59.570 --> 05:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
you know we'd like to think that um
 
05:22:02.330 --> 05:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
we were able to do that uh very quickly
 
05:22:05.208 --> 05:22:05.218 align:start position:0%
my staff did a wonderful job uh in
 
05:22:08.150 --> 05:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
addressing that uh kind of boots on the
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
ground but uh I think to answer your
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
question if all of those positions got
 
05:22:16.490 --> 05:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
hired all at once
 
05:22:21.470 --> 05:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
we would there would be a backlog of
 
05:22:23.330 --> 05:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
getting folks through the through the
 
05:22:25.788 --> 05:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
police academy in a timely fashion that
 
05:22:27.530 --> 05:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
would be a wonderful thing if we could
 
05:22:29.690 --> 05:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
fill all those open spots at once and I
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate that that's going to
 
05:22:31.200 --> 05:22:32.590 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate that that's going to
happen

05:22:32.590 --> 05:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:22:36.650 --> 05:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
but there is a a a kind of a critical
 
05:22:40.128 --> 05:22:40.138 align:start position:0%
need to move people through the academy
 
05:22:40.138 --> 05:22:41.470 align:start position:0%
need to move people through the academy
because

05:22:41.470 --> 05:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:22:45.110 --> 05:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
most agencies are seeing attrition rates
 
05:22:49.310 --> 05:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
at let's just say 10 and the recruitment
 
05:22:51.470 --> 05:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
efforts are probably yielding four
 
05:22:51.480 --> 05:22:52.550 align:start position:0%
efforts are probably yielding four
percent

05:22:52.550 --> 05:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:22:55.070 --> 05:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
so it's it's that dire need of we got to
 
05:22:56.448 --> 05:22:56.458 align:start position:0%
hire these people and get them through
 
05:23:00.830 --> 05:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:23:04.850 --> 05:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
um this is along those same lines is are
 
05:23:07.550 --> 05:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
you seeing class sizes
 
05:23:09.530 --> 05:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
strength in terms of recruits wanting to
 
05:23:10.730 --> 05:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
go through the academy whether the
 
05:23:11.810 --> 05:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
police academy or the correctional
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
Academy are there less that are just
 
05:23:16.070 --> 05:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
coming through the door therefore less
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
on the on the you know the back end in
 
05:23:20.570 --> 05:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to be hired or as
 
05:23:22.310 --> 05:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
class size has been relatively
 
05:23:22.320 --> 05:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
class size has been relatively
consistent

05:23:24.070 --> 05:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
05:23:28.570 --> 05:23:28.580 align:start position:0%
so uh it it's kind of a strange
 
05:23:31.610 --> 05:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
manifestation we're seeing a very full
 
05:23:33.530 --> 05:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
classes at the police academy the
 
05:23:35.330 --> 05:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
full-time Police Academy
 
05:23:37.730 --> 05:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
uh and in fact we have a class that's
 
05:23:39.708 --> 05:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
scheduled to start in January and that's
 
05:23:43.490 --> 05:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
already full and then we have a a second
 
05:23:45.470 --> 05:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
class that starts in February we're
 
05:23:48.288 --> 05:23:48.298 align:start position:0%
going to overlap these classes again uh
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
and that's already that already has
 
05:23:54.590 --> 05:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
about 30 registered folks in them uh
 
05:23:57.230 --> 05:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
on the other hand are part-time police
 
05:24:00.110 --> 05:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
certification program at the beginning
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the year we were going to have an
 
05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
academy and we did not even have 10
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
people and so it it did not make sense
 
05:24:11.150 --> 05:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
to to run that through uh I do know that
 
05:24:15.250 --> 05:24:15.260 align:start position:0%
um uh also the Department of Corrections
 
05:24:19.910 --> 05:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh has had some uh classes that are
 
05:24:24.250 --> 05:24:24.260 align:start position:0%
smaller than usual as well uh again uh
 
05:24:28.128 --> 05:24:28.138 align:start position:0%
there's we're we're seeing a slow
 
05:24:31.010 --> 05:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hemorrhage if if you would where there's
 
05:24:33.730 --> 05:24:33.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of people leaving our profession
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
and uh we don't see as many people
 
05:24:40.850 --> 05:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
signing up and um and I think more so I
 
05:24:42.708 --> 05:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
know that commissioner Hanks is here but
 
05:24:45.730 --> 05:24:45.740 align:start position:0%
more so uh on the on the correction side
 
05:24:48.770 --> 05:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh but it is it is something that we're
 
05:24:50.448 --> 05:24:50.458 align:start position:0%
seeing here in the state and across the
 
05:24:50.458 --> 05:24:54.948 align:start position:0%
seeing here in the state and across the
country

05:24:54.948 --> 05:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:57.288 --> 05:24:57.298 align:start position:0%
for I mean let's just say you had as
 
05:24:59.750 --> 05:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
many people as you could take
 
05:25:01.850 --> 05:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
um what's your capacity to train in a
 
05:25:01.860 --> 05:25:03.350 align:start position:0%
um what's your capacity to train in a
year

05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:25:06.170 --> 05:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
so uh and then I presume different kinds
 
05:25:06.180 --> 05:25:06.890 align:start position:0%
so uh and then I presume different kinds
of

05:25:06.890 --> 05:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:25:09.470 --> 05:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
you know part-time Academy Corrections
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
Etc sure we we could
 
05:25:15.610 --> 05:25:15.620 align:start position:0%
um we could do a hundred part-time
 
05:25:20.208 --> 05:25:20.218 align:start position:0%
people in a year
 
05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
we could do right now in our present
 
05:25:26.510 --> 05:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
rotation we do 210 full-time people a
 
05:25:26.520 --> 05:25:27.530 align:start position:0%
rotation we do 210 full-time people a
year

05:25:27.530 --> 05:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:25:30.230 --> 05:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that
 
05:25:30.240 --> 05:25:31.250 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that
um

05:25:31.250 --> 05:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:34.448 --> 05:25:34.458 align:start position:0%
we could probably do that same number
 
05:25:39.050 --> 05:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
210 with corrections as well uh
 
05:25:43.128 --> 05:25:43.138 align:start position:0%
certainly if uh if we were able to find
 
05:25:46.190 --> 05:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
more training space which is something
 
05:25:49.970 --> 05:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
that we we lack as well we might even be
 
05:25:54.230 --> 05:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
able to uh increase that number if in
 
05:25:56.570 --> 05:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
fact we were able to find that many
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
folks that were ready to to join law
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement here in New Hampshire well
 
05:26:03.230 --> 05:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
and it's actually the question I'm I'm
 
05:26:04.970 --> 05:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
getting at is
 
05:26:04.980 --> 05:26:06.590 align:start position:0%
getting at is
um

05:26:06.590 --> 05:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
your limitations right now are based on
 
05:26:10.368 --> 05:26:10.378 align:start position:0%
a number of people who want to be
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
trained for Your Capacity based on
 
05:26:15.770 --> 05:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
physical plant
 
05:26:19.970 --> 05:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
I I would say that uh if if the number
 
05:26:22.910 --> 05:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
of people applying was not a variable
 
05:26:26.150 --> 05:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
then we're clearly limited by uh we're
 
05:26:28.010 --> 05:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
under resourced we don't we don't have
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
enough training staff and we don't have
 
05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
enough training space
 
05:26:34.610 --> 05:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh and that has been like that
 
05:26:39.530 --> 05:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh in my opinion for a very long time uh
 
05:26:43.430 --> 05:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
we we are literally responsible for
 
05:26:45.650 --> 05:26:45.660 align:start position:0%
certifying every law enforcement officer
 
05:26:48.288 --> 05:26:48.298 align:start position:0%
uh in the state of New Hampshire and yet
 
05:26:48.298 --> 05:26:49.850 align:start position:0%
uh in the state of New Hampshire and yet
uh

05:26:49.850 --> 05:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:26:52.610 --> 05:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh you know our our in-service hours
 
05:26:55.490 --> 05:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
have increased uh from eight hours to 24
 
05:26:59.208 --> 05:26:59.218 align:start position:0%
hours uh we've been asked to do that
 
05:27:01.788 --> 05:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
mission with less people over the last
 
05:27:03.708 --> 05:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
probably 10 years
 
05:27:07.310 --> 05:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
and and candidly ladies and gentlemen uh
 
05:27:10.970 --> 05:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
in an effort to toe the line and and be
 
05:27:13.788 --> 05:27:13.798 align:start position:0%
on target uh there was things that we
 
05:27:15.530 --> 05:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
needed to ask for that I just didn't ask
 
05:27:15.540 --> 05:27:16.368 align:start position:0%
needed to ask for that I just didn't ask
for

05:27:16.368 --> 05:27:16.378 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:27:18.650 --> 05:27:18.660 align:start position:0%
so I I
 
05:27:18.660 --> 05:27:20.090 align:start position:0%
so I I
um

05:27:20.090 --> 05:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:23.030 --> 05:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
we are under resourced but if you had if
 
05:27:26.208 --> 05:27:26.218 align:start position:0%
you had more space or you had more uh
 
05:27:28.730 --> 05:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
trainers if you will
 
05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
um do you have you know seats in the
 
05:27:31.740 --> 05:27:33.350 align:start position:0%
um do you have you know seats in the
chair

05:27:33.350 --> 05:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:27:34.850 --> 05:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
you have enough people to sit in the
 
05:27:34.860 --> 05:27:35.930 align:start position:0%
you have enough people to sit in the
chairs

05:27:35.930 --> 05:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
chairs
 
05:27:39.410 --> 05:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh would you have enough uh students for
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
a life of a better word
 
05:27:43.730 --> 05:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
so I I think again
 
05:27:47.208 --> 05:27:47.218 align:start position:0%
um you know that's uh those those butts
 
05:27:48.530 --> 05:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
in the chairs that we're talking about
 
05:27:51.230 --> 05:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh they're just not they're not signing
 
05:27:53.208 --> 05:27:53.218 align:start position:0%
up they're just not signed we're not
 
05:27:53.218 --> 05:27:54.410 align:start position:0%
up they're just not signed we're not
seeing

05:27:54.410 --> 05:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
05:27:54.420 --> 05:27:56.650 align:start position:0%
seeing
uh

05:27:56.650 --> 05:27:56.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:59.570 --> 05:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
Replacements uh that the attrition rate
 
05:28:02.750 --> 05:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
is just much you know much greater than
 
05:28:04.490 --> 05:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
the recruitment rates right now and
 
05:28:05.930 --> 05:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
that's that really is across the board
 
05:28:07.788 --> 05:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
can you give me a sense of how dramatic
 
05:28:10.368 --> 05:28:10.378 align:start position:0%
like what was it like five years ago in
 
05:28:11.628 --> 05:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
terms of number of let's just say
 
05:28:11.638 --> 05:28:13.250 align:start position:0%
terms of number of let's just say
full-time

05:28:13.250 --> 05:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
05:28:17.090 --> 05:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
police officer candidates so I I would
 
05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
say that we were
 
05:28:20.810 --> 05:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
um and I can speak to the short time
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
that I have been the director
 
05:28:26.448 --> 05:28:26.458 align:start position:0%
so when I very first was appointed uh we
 
05:28:29.948 --> 05:28:29.958 align:start position:0%
were running classes at right around 65
 
05:28:32.690 --> 05:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
and we were running three classes a year
 
05:28:35.570 --> 05:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
and there might be a couple of a couple
 
05:28:37.190 --> 05:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
of recruits that would have to wait for
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
the next class
 
05:28:41.208 --> 05:28:41.218 align:start position:0%
but it was pretty consistent
 
05:28:43.550 --> 05:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
I think the Corrections Academy enjoyed
 
05:28:47.510 --> 05:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
greater numbers as well uh for uh
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
recruit officers
 
05:28:54.948 --> 05:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
I we're still seeing people signing up
 
05:28:57.288 --> 05:28:57.298 align:start position:0%
for that full-time Academy
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh the urgency is coming from the
 
05:29:03.708 --> 05:29:03.718 align:start position:0%
communities that are probably
 
05:29:06.948 --> 05:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
experiencing uh we we tried to run a
 
05:29:09.770 --> 05:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
survey we didn't get a lot of responses
 
05:29:12.050 --> 05:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
and so you know it's the numbers are
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
only as good as the numbers but we're
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a uh
 
05:29:20.590 --> 05:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
estimated 20 percent
 
05:29:24.830 --> 05:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
decrease or 20 percent open uh positions
 
05:29:24.840 --> 05:29:26.810 align:start position:0%
decrease or 20 percent open uh positions
vacancies

05:29:26.810 --> 05:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
05:29:29.030 --> 05:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
on average across the state of New
 
05:29:30.230 --> 05:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for New Hampshire law
 
05:29:30.240 --> 05:29:31.250 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for New Hampshire law
enforcement

05:29:31.250 --> 05:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:29:34.850 --> 05:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
uh anecdotally I've been a New Hampshire
 
05:29:38.090 --> 05:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
police officer for almost 40 years now I
 
05:29:41.270 --> 05:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
have never in those those 38 nine years
 
05:29:43.250 --> 05:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
seen that the New Hampshire State Police
 
05:29:46.368 --> 05:29:46.378 align:start position:0%
have that many vacancies uh and that's
 
05:29:49.010 --> 05:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
that should serve as an example of
 
05:29:51.530 --> 05:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
really what this state is experiencing
 
05:29:53.470 --> 05:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
right now for for
 
05:29:56.448 --> 05:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates across the board there's
 
05:29:59.570 --> 05:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
very very few agencies that if any
 
05:30:04.190 --> 05:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
candidly that have full staffs right now
 
05:30:07.128 --> 05:30:07.138 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:16.730 --> 05:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
like to invite the New Hampshire Lottery
 
05:30:45.550 --> 05:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:45.560 --> 05:30:47.448 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:30:47.448 --> 05:30:47.458 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:30:49.610 --> 05:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
If You Begin by telling yourself no one
 
05:30:50.990 --> 05:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire won that billion dollar
 
05:30:54.650 --> 05:30:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh that's funny the um we've had three
 
05:30:59.390 --> 05:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
winners over over 100 million dollars in
 
05:31:02.510 --> 05:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
the last five years uh so you know we
 
05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
got our numbers anyway so it's it's
 
05:31:08.330 --> 05:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
warming is it a woman Charlie it's I can
 
05:31:10.550 --> 05:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
do that why
 
05:31:14.170 --> 05:31:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:16.250 --> 05:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
but that's the wrong dude this is the
 
05:31:18.770 --> 05:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
wrong hearing to use that money and I
 
05:31:20.390 --> 05:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
figured you spend it once I hold it out
 
05:31:21.948 --> 05:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
you know knowing how the state works as
 
05:31:23.930 --> 05:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
soon as I showed it
 
05:31:25.610 --> 05:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon everyone good
 
05:31:27.708 --> 05:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Charlie McIntyre
 
05:31:29.810 --> 05:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
I'm director of New Hampshire lottery uh
 
05:31:31.128 --> 05:31:31.138 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as the chief bookmaking
 
05:31:33.230 --> 05:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
officer for the state and with me is our
 
05:31:36.410 --> 05:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
chief bean counter Jim durris our CFO
 
05:31:36.420 --> 05:31:37.010 align:start position:0%
chief bean counter Jim durris our CFO
um

05:31:37.010 --> 05:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:39.770 --> 05:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
I remember briefly what I this the slide
 
05:31:42.650 --> 05:31:42.660 align:start position:0%
I handed out obviously is one we take
 
05:31:44.628 --> 05:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
tremendous pride in
 
05:31:47.708 --> 05:31:47.718 align:start position:0%
um in the past two full fiscal years
 
05:31:50.810 --> 05:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
we've transferred 290 million dollars of
 
05:31:52.910 --> 05:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
net profit to the state
 
05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
in the two years prior to that was 205
 
05:31:59.090 --> 05:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
million dollars in profit to the state
 
05:32:02.030 --> 05:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
and our expenses barely moved uh in the
 
05:32:03.530 --> 05:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
private sector when you increase net
 
05:32:06.230 --> 05:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
revenues by 85 million dollars and
 
05:32:08.690 --> 05:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
barely increase expenses that is
 
05:32:10.610 --> 05:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
considered better than good
 
05:32:14.868 --> 05:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
uh and so I submit our request for the
 
05:32:19.390 --> 05:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
budget for FY 20 4 and 25. one of the
 
05:32:22.368 --> 05:32:22.378 align:start position:0%
benefits to my job in our position is
 
05:32:25.090 --> 05:32:25.100 align:start position:0%
that we are Net Zero to the state budget
 
05:32:27.830 --> 05:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
ours is just a permission to spend from
 
05:32:31.010 --> 05:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
our expenses come from our revenues so
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
that 85 million dollar increase in net
 
05:32:37.970 --> 05:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
profitability also included our expenses
 
05:32:40.128 --> 05:32:40.138 align:start position:0%
um one of the worst Parts about my job
 
05:32:42.650 --> 05:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
and our job is is that you folks spend
 
05:32:44.208 --> 05:32:44.218 align:start position:0%
it before we make it
 
05:32:47.448 --> 05:32:47.458 align:start position:0%
uh and so we have to take into account
 
05:32:49.910 --> 05:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
market conditions and variabilities that
 
05:32:52.610 --> 05:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
I just can't foresee uh I would note
 
05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
most heartily the increase in gas prices
 
05:32:57.470 --> 05:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
and Ukraine war that neither of us saw
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
when we get a revenue estimates last
 
05:32:58.798 --> 05:33:00.050 align:start position:0%
when we get a revenue estimates last
time

05:33:00.050 --> 05:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:33:02.208 --> 05:33:02.218 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing worse than gas prices
 
05:33:04.910 --> 05:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
for lottery sales nearly half of our net
 
05:33:06.948 --> 05:33:06.958 align:start position:0%
revenues our sales the traditional
 
05:33:08.590 --> 05:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
Lottery happened to places that sell gas
 
05:33:12.410 --> 05:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
so when gas spikes over four dollars you
 
05:33:13.730 --> 05:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
don't walk in the store use the bathroom
 
05:33:17.810 --> 05:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
you poke your tank and leave and so that
 
05:33:19.368 --> 05:33:19.378 align:start position:0%
being said uh Jim if you wouldn't mind
 
05:33:22.910 --> 05:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
going through the uh prioritize needs
 
05:33:24.530 --> 05:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
the there's only a few of them obviously
 
05:33:26.090 --> 05:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
I know we're behind so I'll be quick
 
05:33:28.010 --> 05:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
we'll be quick yeah
 
05:33:30.708 --> 05:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
um so we have uh
 
05:33:33.288 --> 05:33:33.298 align:start position:0%
seven prioritized needs listed upside
 
05:33:33.298 --> 05:33:35.270 align:start position:0%
seven prioritized needs listed upside
six

05:33:35.270 --> 05:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
six
 
05:33:37.490 --> 05:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
um again I'll go quickly one of them is
 
05:33:41.570 --> 05:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:43.850 --> 05:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
years ago we had one back office system
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we used with all of our gamer
 
05:33:47.868 --> 05:33:47.878 align:start position:0%
information which customers in our sense
 
05:33:50.270 --> 05:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the word would be in there now we've
 
05:33:52.250 --> 05:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
added ilottery platform which is a
 
05:33:53.930 --> 05:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
completely separate system from that and
 
05:33:55.850 --> 05:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
now we've also added draftking system
 
05:33:58.730 --> 05:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
again a third system so whenever we want
 
05:34:00.770 --> 05:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
to pull data and information about who
 
05:34:04.250 --> 05:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
our customers are and to increase to
 
05:34:07.128 --> 05:34:07.138 align:start position:0%
design games increase profits any of
 
05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
those things we have three separate
 
05:34:11.030 --> 05:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
systems going on so the first priority
 
05:34:13.730 --> 05:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
ties need is for 2.4 million dollars
 
05:34:17.570 --> 05:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
over the two-year span that is to create
 
05:34:19.010 --> 05:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
a data warehouse and a business
 
05:34:21.350 --> 05:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
intelligence tool along with a CRM
 
05:34:24.050 --> 05:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
system so that we can gather all that
 
05:34:28.030 --> 05:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
information through one one uh system
 
05:34:30.770 --> 05:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
from those three different systems and
 
05:34:32.868 --> 05:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
Lord knows what's hap happening on down
 
05:34:34.730 --> 05:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
the road as well to incorporate those
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
systems into a into um
 
05:34:41.090 --> 05:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
a program like that
 
05:34:41.100 --> 05:34:41.690 align:start position:0%
a program like that
um

05:34:41.690 --> 05:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:41.700 --> 05:34:43.910 align:start position:0%
um
the

05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:34:47.750 --> 05:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
other one is we have 126 000 in our
 
05:34:50.208 --> 05:34:50.218 align:start position:0%
generator is uh over 30 years old at
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
this point our generator obviously it is
 
05:34:54.890 --> 05:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
what it is it's our backup power system
 
05:34:57.170 --> 05:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
which is vital to our agency if we do
 
05:34:59.390 --> 05:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
lose power and our gaming systems can't
 
05:35:01.250 --> 05:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
be up and running obviously anytime
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
you're not selling tickets and uh you're
 
05:35:06.050 --> 05:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
losing money uh so that's a system
 
05:35:07.310 --> 05:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's been out
 
05:35:07.320 --> 05:35:07.850 align:start position:0%
that's been out
um

05:35:07.850 --> 05:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:07.860 --> 05:35:09.590 align:start position:0%
um
of

05:35:09.590 --> 05:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:35:12.410 --> 05:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh according to Engineers report should
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
have been replaced in 2017.
 
05:35:20.150 --> 05:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh we also have a server room as part of
 
05:35:22.070 --> 05:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
the same project we've had it engineered
 
05:35:24.948 --> 05:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
our server room is also protected by
 
05:35:27.050 --> 05:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
water sprinkler systems
 
05:35:29.628 --> 05:35:29.638 align:start position:0%
that is not a good idea you don't want
 
05:35:30.948 --> 05:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
to be dumping water all over your
 
05:35:34.490 --> 05:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
computer equipment if alarm does go off
 
05:35:36.590 --> 05:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
um so that's would also include an
 
05:35:38.750 --> 05:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
upgrade to that system which would get
 
05:35:40.128 --> 05:35:40.138 align:start position:0%
it into I can't remember what it's
 
05:35:42.830 --> 05:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
called but it's a something like that
 
05:35:48.350 --> 05:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:48.360 --> 05:35:49.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:35:49.330 --> 05:35:49.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:49.340 --> 05:35:51.170 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:35:51.170 --> 05:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:35:53.570 --> 05:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
um we also have a project in that we've
 
05:35:56.448 --> 05:35:56.458 align:start position:0%
asked for I'm losing my spot here that
 
05:35:58.430 --> 05:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
would be a roof replacement along those
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
same lines some we have a very leaky
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
roof and I know some other agencies have
 
05:36:04.730 --> 05:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
dealt with that issue for a very long
 
05:36:04.740 --> 05:36:06.110 align:start position:0%
dealt with that issue for a very long
time

05:36:06.110 --> 05:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:36:07.368 --> 05:36:07.378 align:start position:0%
um I would again say a little bit
 
05:36:09.230 --> 05:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
differences ours is that we have some of
 
05:36:10.610 --> 05:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
those leaks that are getting very close
 
05:36:13.190 --> 05:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
to that server room as well
 
05:36:15.230 --> 05:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
um where if something happens there and
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're shut down and one thing I always
 
05:36:18.948 --> 05:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
have to keep in mind when I'm looking at
 
05:36:20.448 --> 05:36:20.458 align:start position:0%
these is
 
05:36:23.330 --> 05:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
if our internal control systems go down
 
05:36:25.670 --> 05:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
when you have a Powerball jackpot like
 
05:36:27.410 --> 05:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
we did a few weeks ago of two billion
 
05:36:29.810 --> 05:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
dollars if our systems go down because
 
05:36:32.330 --> 05:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
of some problem like this it's not only
 
05:36:33.830 --> 05:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire but it's the
 
05:36:35.628 --> 05:36:35.638 align:start position:0%
entire country that can't verify those
 
05:36:37.610 --> 05:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
numbers and we're now the state of
 
05:36:39.550 --> 05:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
Minnesota who's not alone
 
05:36:42.288 --> 05:36:42.298 align:start position:0%
who's not allowing a 2 billion dollar
 
05:36:45.948 --> 05:36:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.208 --> 05:36:50.218 align:start position:0%
so and we also have put in a request for
 
05:36:50.218 --> 05:36:51.170 align:start position:0%
so and we also have put in a request for
um

05:36:51.170 --> 05:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
media costs and things like that again
 
05:36:56.030 --> 05:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
everything's gone up significantly over
 
05:36:57.288 --> 05:36:57.298 align:start position:0%
the last couple years and I'll let you
 
05:36:59.868 --> 05:36:59.878 align:start position:0%
adjust that yeah so for example media
 
05:36:59.878 --> 05:37:00.590 align:start position:0%
adjust that yeah so for example media
cost

05:37:00.590 --> 05:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
um one is first our partnership with
 
05:37:05.150 --> 05:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
DraftKings requires us to do a media
 
05:37:07.390 --> 05:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
spend in the state and that's by design
 
05:37:11.090 --> 05:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
it I don't say limits but it accurately
 
05:37:13.250 --> 05:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
reflects the amount of media necessary
 
05:37:16.190 --> 05:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
versus other states which get blasted by
 
05:37:17.948 --> 05:37:17.958 align:start position:0%
media from sports betting companies
 
05:37:21.050 --> 05:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
incessantly mass is going to has
 
05:37:24.050 --> 05:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
legalized sports betting finally we'd
 
05:37:25.788 --> 05:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
like to thank them for not doing it for
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
so long that we profited immensely from
 
05:37:30.288 --> 05:37:30.298 align:start position:0%
their citizen or citizenry
 
05:37:32.330 --> 05:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and so we will be competing in open
 
05:37:36.288 --> 05:37:36.298 align:start position:0%
market with them also the cost of media
 
05:37:38.270 --> 05:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
has gone up about 20 percent the cost of
 
05:37:39.470 --> 05:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
production costs have gone up about 20
 
05:37:42.410 --> 05:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
percent uh as you see from our budget
 
05:37:44.208 --> 05:37:44.218 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of our budget is not
 
05:37:46.970 --> 05:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
people it is services and goods and so
 
05:37:49.730 --> 05:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
with the inflationary lift all the
 
05:37:52.670 --> 05:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
things we buy went up similar holy in
 
05:37:55.610 --> 05:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
terms of cost we had to get from Indiana
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
to get a vehicle
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
to find a vehicle we could you could buy
 
05:38:02.390 --> 05:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and so media like I said the half
 
05:38:03.770 --> 05:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
million dollar increase in both of the
 
05:38:05.690 --> 05:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
years is specifically for media
 
05:38:09.288 --> 05:38:09.298 align:start position:0%
purchasing uh production costs
 
05:38:10.490 --> 05:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
05:38:12.288 --> 05:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
probably uh your positions if you want
 
05:38:13.368 --> 05:38:13.378 align:start position:0%
to touch it oh no there's certainly the
 
05:38:15.890 --> 05:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
seven positions which
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
growth requires support
 
05:38:19.910 --> 05:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
and in the last 10 years we've doubled
 
05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
net profitability and we're looking to
 
05:38:21.840 --> 05:38:22.490 align:start position:0%
net profitability and we're looking to
support

05:38:22.490 --> 05:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:38:25.910 --> 05:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
essentially that effort uh it's not by
 
05:38:27.708 --> 05:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
accident it requires people and effort
 
05:38:29.270 --> 05:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
and such so
 
05:38:31.128 --> 05:38:31.138 align:start position:0%
um you know we're proud of the number of
 
05:38:32.868 --> 05:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
accomplishments we have we're amongst
 
05:38:34.670 --> 05:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
the top lotteries in virtually every
 
05:38:36.708 --> 05:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
category in the US so
 
05:38:38.448 --> 05:38:38.458 align:start position:0%
um we're proud of efforts happy to
 
05:38:40.610 --> 05:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you thank you
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned Massachusetts I know
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
they've had a little difficulty
 
05:38:47.448 --> 05:38:47.458 align:start position:0%
implementing their their program uh much
 
05:38:49.670 --> 05:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
much to our Delight but
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
um what sort of impact are we expecting
 
05:38:54.708 --> 05:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
on our revenues from their
 
05:38:57.530 --> 05:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
implementation of sports bang so it's a
 
05:38:59.030 --> 05:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I get a lot as
 
05:39:00.650 --> 05:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
you could imagine right
 
05:39:03.230 --> 05:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
um right now we derive probably 25 to 30
 
05:39:04.970 --> 05:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
percent of our
 
05:39:08.208 --> 05:39:08.218 align:start position:0%
net revenue net gaming and sports
 
05:39:11.570 --> 05:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
betting from Massachusetts players
 
05:39:14.030 --> 05:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I would expect it to go down slightly
 
05:39:17.090 --> 05:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much only for a couple
 
05:39:18.708 --> 05:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
of reasons one is we now have their
 
05:39:21.288 --> 05:39:21.298 align:start position:0%
Player information they're now customers
 
05:39:23.330 --> 05:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
of ours
 
05:39:25.190 --> 05:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
serve his dad
 
05:39:27.590 --> 05:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
a large they make up a larger percentage
 
05:39:29.868 --> 05:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
of actually who visit the facilities
 
05:39:33.110 --> 05:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
that are at Seabrook in Manchester
 
05:39:34.670 --> 05:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
and we don't have that fancy state
 
05:39:37.070 --> 05:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
income tax they have in Massachusetts uh
 
05:39:38.570 --> 05:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
we plan on taking full effort of that as
 
05:39:39.890 --> 05:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
a marketing
 
05:39:39.900 --> 05:39:41.868 align:start position:0%
a marketing
principle

05:39:41.868 --> 05:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
principle
 
05:39:43.490 --> 05:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and they're comfortable along where
 
05:39:45.830 --> 05:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
they are now the closest physical
 
05:39:48.288 --> 05:39:48.298 align:start position:0%
location to Northern Massachusetts is
 
05:39:48.298 --> 05:39:49.250 align:start position:0%
location to Northern Massachusetts is
Everett

05:39:49.250 --> 05:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
Everett
 
05:39:51.650 --> 05:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
which is not really built out for a
 
05:39:53.330 --> 05:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
physical sports book
 
05:39:55.850 --> 05:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
parking is tricky they're trying to put
 
05:39:57.948 --> 05:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
kiosks for sports betting in the parking
 
05:40:00.110 --> 05:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
lot which is about the dumbest thing you
 
05:40:00.970 --> 05:40:00.980 align:start position:0%
could do
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
and not having much success so
 
05:40:07.430 --> 05:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's 25 is my point I
 
05:40:09.410 --> 05:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact number New Jersey
 
05:40:10.250 --> 05:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
thought they were going to take a
 
05:40:11.690 --> 05:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
massive hit when New York legalized it
 
05:40:14.270 --> 05:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
it barely moved the needle so I'm hoping
 
05:40:19.570 --> 05:40:19.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:22.190 --> 05:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
to to what extent
 
05:40:25.970 --> 05:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
um first of all nice opening I mean
 
05:40:28.850 --> 05:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
I picture a thousand words you must have
 
05:40:29.810 --> 05:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
a shot
 
05:40:32.208 --> 05:40:32.218 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
05:40:35.628 --> 05:40:35.638 align:start position:0%
to what extent are are you know we still
 
05:40:38.330 --> 05:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
know people who who were addicted or
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the wrong word sorry
 
05:40:41.510 --> 05:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets right and they would
 
05:40:43.970 --> 05:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
just you know every Tuesday and they'd
 
05:40:45.708 --> 05:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
buy like 12 scratch tickets and sit and
 
05:40:47.810 --> 05:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts scratching away
 
05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
um to what extent is uh do the online
 
05:40:53.390 --> 05:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
things and the keno and all the sort of
 
05:40:55.850 --> 05:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
new availability of of sort of the
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
instant gratification
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
betting cannibal has that so you're
 
05:41:01.970 --> 05:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
asking them what's the meaning of life
 
05:41:03.410 --> 05:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
question essentially like what's what
 
05:41:05.150 --> 05:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
does new gaming do
 
05:41:08.510 --> 05:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
um if you read the research which I do
 
05:41:10.128 --> 05:41:10.138 align:start position:0%
um it would suggest that the number of
 
05:41:12.830 --> 05:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
folks who have problem gambling is not a
 
05:41:15.288 --> 05:41:15.298 align:start position:0%
variable that changes it's one half two
 
05:41:17.628 --> 05:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
percent that member exists even in
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
Hawaii which has no lawful gambling
 
05:41:22.670 --> 05:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
the availability of gambling increases
 
05:41:25.910 --> 05:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
those folks's spend and problems and so
 
05:41:27.948 --> 05:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
any increase in the amount of gambling
 
05:41:30.110 --> 05:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
should be met commensurably with an
 
05:41:32.448 --> 05:41:32.458 align:start position:0%
increase in treatment
 
05:41:35.030 --> 05:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
so in a population of a million adults
 
05:41:37.070 --> 05:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
for example in New Hampshire two percent
 
05:41:39.770 --> 05:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
is you know 20 000 people would have a
 
05:41:42.288 --> 05:41:42.298 align:start position:0%
problem who if they're engaged or not in
 
05:41:43.850 --> 05:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
recovery should have an issue that
 
05:41:46.010 --> 05:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
should be addressed
 
05:41:48.050 --> 05:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
I don't think more stuff equals more
 
05:41:50.570 --> 05:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
gambling and oddly sports betting is a
 
05:41:53.090 --> 05:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
very Niche product
 
05:41:56.150 --> 05:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
meaning very few people do it and they
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
in our biggest Munch which was last
 
05:42:02.208 --> 05:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
month we only had 30 000 people
 
05:42:04.490 --> 05:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
actively engaged with the platform so
 
05:42:05.628 --> 05:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
that's less than three percent of the
 
05:42:07.970 --> 05:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
adults in the state and that included
 
05:42:09.948 --> 05:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
almost a third from Massachusetts and so
 
05:42:12.470 --> 05:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's not a big pool of people that do it
 
05:42:14.208 --> 05:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense how's that compare
 
05:42:16.430 --> 05:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
does it say scratch tickets
 
05:42:18.590 --> 05:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
um the most ubiquitous would be
 
05:42:18.600 --> 05:42:20.150 align:start position:0%
um the most ubiquitous would be
Powerball

05:42:20.150 --> 05:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
Powerball
 
05:42:21.590 --> 05:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and so Powerball would be I'm just
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
saying though if you're looking for the
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
biggest pool Powerball we sold 60 of the
 
05:42:26.930 --> 05:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
adults in the state of Powerball ticket
 
05:42:28.190 --> 05:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:42:31.788 --> 05:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
so that's the biggest pool really yes
 
05:42:34.610 --> 05:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't uh I'd have lost a bet on
 
05:42:34.620 --> 05:42:35.590 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't uh I'd have lost a bet on
that

05:42:35.590 --> 05:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
did you were you one of them I was not
 
05:42:44.090 --> 05:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not gonna say that um gambling
 
05:42:50.448 --> 05:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:52.490 --> 05:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
I didn't I didn't feel like buying a
 
05:42:55.250 --> 05:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
ticket appreciably changed my odds I
 
05:42:57.350 --> 05:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
apprecially change drugs it's it's so
 
05:42:58.910 --> 05:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
funny I when this person who won
 
05:43:00.230 --> 05:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
Powerball when they signed the back of
 
05:43:01.610 --> 05:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
the ticket I said Well why'd you sign it
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
well I didn't think I'd win I'm like
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
well you they won you know 400 million
 
05:43:09.110 --> 05:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
so they had a good day not a bad day I
 
05:43:10.868 --> 05:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
would like to have that day
 
05:43:13.610 --> 05:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
we forgot the director's 10 contribution
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%

rehabilitative qualities

on page two we list a short list of
 
05:46:04.850 --> 05:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
challenges and accomplishments we are
 
05:46:07.010 --> 05:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
continually experiencing major
 
05:46:08.990 --> 05:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
challenges in Recruitment and Retention
 
05:46:11.150 --> 05:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
and have certainly seen those
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
exacerbations post covid-19 the
 
05:46:16.190 --> 05:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections held its own
 
05:46:17.930 --> 05:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
and did an amazing job with the staff
 
05:46:20.810 --> 05:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
there through those very tough years in
 
05:46:22.510 --> 05:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
a correctional environment fighting a
 
05:46:25.788 --> 05:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
infectious disease you can't see with
 
05:46:27.530 --> 05:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
our staff and our staff that were
 
05:46:30.230 --> 05:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
working 24 7 in our state facilities and
 
05:46:32.628 --> 05:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
who are not home about working very hard
 
05:46:34.730 --> 05:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
but post covid we've had a lot of people
 
05:46:37.910 --> 05:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
choose to retire deservedly and as you
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
just heard in the previous testimony of
 
05:46:41.868 --> 05:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
police dance and training Council the
 
05:46:45.048 --> 05:46:45.058 align:start position:0%
deficits we saw before are only further
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by the current law
 
05:46:48.830 --> 05:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement deficits not just in the
 
05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
state but nationally and in Corrections
 
05:46:53.570 --> 05:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
and as time leaves things are the State
 
05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
of Florida has an article out about
 
05:46:57.410 --> 05:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
putting 300 National Guard service
 
05:46:59.208 --> 05:46:59.218 align:start position:0%
members across the their Correctional
 
05:47:01.310 --> 05:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
Facilities to fulfill their mission and
 
05:47:03.048 --> 05:47:03.058 align:start position:0%
as the state of New Hampshire has done
 
05:47:04.970 --> 05:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
that on occasion we continue to
 
05:47:04.980 --> 05:47:06.490 align:start position:0%
that on occasion we continue to
persevere

05:47:06.490 --> 05:47:06.500 align:start position:0%
persevere
 
05:47:10.490 --> 05:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
each month and each day and look forward
 
05:47:12.830 --> 05:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
to finding additional resources to help
 
05:47:14.990 --> 05:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
this agency but it is a real problem
 
05:47:16.430 --> 05:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
just not in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:47:19.270 --> 05:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
it is a real problem across the country
 
05:47:22.190 --> 05:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
we are challenged primarily with aging
 
05:47:23.390 --> 05:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at the New Hampshire
 
05:47:26.390 --> 05:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
state prison for men the institution in
 
05:47:28.850 --> 05:47:28.860 align:start position:0%
the North country as we refer to it as
 
05:47:31.010 --> 05:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
ncf or North Country facility was built
 
05:47:33.708 --> 05:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
in 2000 our new women's facility built
 
05:47:37.490 --> 05:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the infrastructure at the
 
05:47:39.470 --> 05:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
Concord state prison for men is a
 
05:47:41.330 --> 05:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
historical research project in and of
 
05:47:43.910 --> 05:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
itself but it needs to be rebuilt and I
 
05:47:45.470 --> 05:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
think the governor advance for his
 
05:47:48.110 --> 05:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
opening sentence sentiments about moving
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
us forward in that direction over time
 
05:47:53.390 --> 05:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh with that said we have implemented a
 
05:47:55.490 --> 05:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
lot of things to try to improve the
 
05:47:57.288 --> 05:47:57.298 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of our staff given
 
05:47:58.910 --> 05:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
the overtime requirements we place on
 
05:48:01.850 --> 05:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
them as a state and we've implemented an
 
05:48:03.470 --> 05:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
employee wellness program which we
 
05:48:04.970 --> 05:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
continue to advance
 
05:48:08.330 --> 05:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
we've increased increased capacity to
 
05:48:10.430 --> 05:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
provide substance use disorder treatment
 
05:48:12.230 --> 05:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
services through a program we call our
 
05:48:15.048 --> 05:48:15.058 align:start position:0%
Focus program and I will affirm for you
 
05:48:16.730 --> 05:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
that substance use disorder is one of
 
05:48:17.690 --> 05:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
the number one drivers of
 
05:48:17.700 --> 05:48:19.368 align:start position:0%
the number one drivers of
reincarceration

05:48:19.368 --> 05:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
reincarceration
 
05:48:19.378 --> 05:48:20.570 align:start position:0%
reincarceration
um

05:48:20.570 --> 05:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:23.390 --> 05:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
with that said we've also turned our our
 
05:48:25.430 --> 05:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
minds to medication-assisted treatment
 
05:48:27.170 --> 05:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
and accomplished increasing the
 
05:48:30.230 --> 05:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
medications that we employ in that
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
treatment regimen and there's details of
 
05:48:34.128 --> 05:48:34.138 align:start position:0%
that work and happy to talk further
 
05:48:35.990 --> 05:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
about that with anyone offline as I love
 
05:48:37.610 --> 05:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
to Intrigue commissionerling house with
 
05:48:40.070 --> 05:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
our work we have collaborated with the
 
05:48:41.628 --> 05:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
05:48:43.010 --> 05:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to allow residents to
 
05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
participate in computer numerical
 
05:48:47.510 --> 05:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
control Machining boot camp for nine
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
weeks and continue to have those those
 
05:48:51.170 --> 05:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
are important advancements that we've
 
05:48:53.628 --> 05:48:53.638 align:start position:0%
made during covid post covet I know so
 
05:48:55.548 --> 05:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
we're still in covid
 
05:48:57.890 --> 05:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
um to improve the education of
 
05:48:59.930 --> 05:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
vocational training that we offer people
 
05:49:01.670 --> 05:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
who are incarcerated because that is one
 
05:49:02.930 --> 05:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
of the number one rehabilitative
 
05:49:04.610 --> 05:49:04.620 align:start position:0%
activities that we can do to reduce
 
05:49:07.730 --> 05:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
reincarceration with that said we've
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
also continued to work with some grant
 
05:49:12.410 --> 05:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
funding we do get some grant funding by
 
05:49:14.390 --> 05:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
the National Science Foundation titled
 
05:49:16.310 --> 05:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
prisons evolving as connected
 
05:49:19.070 --> 05:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
communities and we've been engaging with
 
05:49:21.170 --> 05:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
Community stakeholders to develop a
 
05:49:23.390 --> 05:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
prism model of connected community that
 
05:49:24.948 --> 05:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
will address information and Technology
 
05:49:28.310 --> 05:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
to create both a in and out model if you
 
05:49:30.288 --> 05:49:30.298 align:start position:0%
will of incarcerated education and
 
05:49:32.810 --> 05:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
Vocational skills I'm a member as well
 
05:49:34.490 --> 05:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
as another member of my team of a newly
 
05:49:36.410 --> 05:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
formed New England Commission on the
 
05:49:38.170 --> 05:49:38.180 align:start position:0%
future of higher education Behind Bars
 
05:49:40.910 --> 05:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
and we've done really unique things
 
05:49:43.610 --> 05:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
working with Partners such as cast in
 
05:49:45.770 --> 05:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
Universal Design learning to change
 
05:49:47.750 --> 05:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
curriculums that you'll see and see in
 
05:49:50.270 --> 05:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
our our school institutions our Choose
 
05:49:52.430 --> 05:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
Love program and have adapted that to
 
05:49:54.530 --> 05:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
adults who are incarcerated and that was
 
05:49:56.208 --> 05:49:56.218 align:start position:0%
a national first for the New Hampshire
 
05:49:58.010 --> 05:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and that
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
program is often running and changing
 
05:50:01.670 --> 05:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
people's perspectives and reducing
 
05:50:01.680 --> 05:50:02.930 align:start position:0%
people's perspectives and reducing
violence

05:50:02.930 --> 05:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
violence
 
05:50:06.170 --> 05:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
foreign those are just a small List look
 
05:50:07.850 --> 05:50:07.860 align:start position:0%
forward to our future annual report or
 
05:50:09.410 --> 05:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
pass annual reports to learn more about
 
05:50:11.150 --> 05:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
our accomplishments and our challenges
 
05:50:14.330 --> 05:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
on page three is a high level summary of
 
05:50:18.410 --> 05:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
our proposal for fy24 and fy25
 
05:50:21.288 --> 05:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
our costs are primarily I don't think
 
05:50:23.628 --> 05:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
you'll be surprised salary and benefits
 
05:50:25.788 --> 05:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
we are human resources driven
 
05:50:28.610 --> 05:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
organization the other large area is our
 
05:50:30.890 --> 05:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
medical and pharmaceutical expenses and
 
05:50:32.208 --> 05:50:32.218 align:start position:0%
there are other operational costs
 
05:50:34.430 --> 05:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
that'll get into the detail as you can
 
05:50:38.150 --> 05:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
see we show our actual of FY 2022 our
 
05:50:40.910 --> 05:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized of 2023 and the
 
05:50:42.350 --> 05:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
differences between our three percent
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
efficiency because you'll go that's more
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
than three percent I can do that math is
 
05:50:49.490 --> 05:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
associated with the inclusion of funding
 
05:50:51.470 --> 05:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
we had for body worn cameras that was
 
05:50:56.708 --> 05:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
not part of FY 2024 forecast as well as
 
05:50:58.850 --> 05:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
adjustments in our probation and parole
 
05:51:03.770 --> 05:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
teams salaries and and rent I wonder who
 
05:51:05.868 --> 05:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
charges us rent
 
05:51:07.548 --> 05:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
um so those allowed us to have a
 
05:51:09.770 --> 05:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
slightly larger what appear to be a
 
05:51:11.448 --> 05:51:11.458 align:start position:0%
larger but it is still within that three
 
05:51:14.990 --> 05:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
percent efficiency for 2024 and then uh
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
trying to stay relatively static in
 
05:51:16.798 --> 05:51:18.530 align:start position:0%
trying to stay relatively static in
2025.

05:51:18.530 --> 05:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
05:51:20.150 --> 05:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
I will not go through all of these lines
 
05:51:21.770 --> 05:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
as I know you will look at them with the
 
05:51:24.830 --> 05:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
intent in which you have received them
 
05:51:26.510 --> 05:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I will certainly continue to be
 
05:51:28.788 --> 05:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
available to ask questions on page four
 
05:51:31.190 --> 05:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
we dive into our Personnel Services they
 
05:51:33.470 --> 05:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
do average about 74 percent of our total
 
05:51:35.330 --> 05:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
general fund requests over the biennium
 
05:51:37.548 --> 05:51:37.558 align:start position:0%
that is our classified unclassified and
 
05:51:39.048 --> 05:51:39.058 align:start position:0%
part-time salaries it includes our
 
05:51:41.570 --> 05:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
holiday paid part-time pay overtime pay
 
05:51:43.730 --> 05:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
and benefits
 
05:51:46.430 --> 05:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
um we continue to aggressively recruit
 
05:51:50.170 --> 05:51:50.180 align:start position:0%
and work for retention uh the FY
 
05:51:53.708 --> 05:51:53.718 align:start position:0%
2024-2025 budget does include funding
 
05:51:57.850 --> 05:51:57.860 align:start position:0%
973 positions it sets our overtime at
 
05:52:00.948 --> 05:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
5.49 you might ask me why I will tell
 
05:52:02.510 --> 05:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
you why a little further
 
05:52:04.448 --> 05:52:04.458 align:start position:0%
that it's not a higher number
 
05:52:06.890 --> 05:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
we are still asking for the statutory
 
05:52:08.930 --> 05:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
authority to continue to move monies
 
05:52:11.330 --> 05:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
associated with vacant positions that
 
05:52:12.770 --> 05:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
has been a very effective Financial
 
05:52:14.810 --> 05:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
strategy we do that very transparency
 
05:52:16.730 --> 05:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
going transparently going before the
 
05:52:18.048 --> 05:52:18.058 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and governor and
 
05:52:21.770 --> 05:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
Council we did up that over timeline as
 
05:52:25.368 --> 05:52:25.378 align:start position:0%
a base because of different bargained
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
salaries and wages that would affect it
 
05:52:29.690 --> 05:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
normally so you'll see the budget
 
05:52:31.610 --> 05:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
footnote that we propose underneath on
 
05:52:33.770 --> 05:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
page four
 
05:52:36.230 --> 05:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
on page five we show you a trended
 
05:52:38.510 --> 05:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
analysis of our overtime some of that
 
05:52:40.910 --> 05:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
over time is indicative of adjustments
 
05:52:43.250 --> 05:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
in salaries through bargaining but also
 
05:52:45.170 --> 05:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
increased vacancies right now
 
05:52:48.110 --> 05:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
organizationally we have 28 vacancy rate
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
when we look at targeted areas ones that
 
05:52:52.730 --> 05:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
hurt us the most our security positions
 
05:52:54.890 --> 05:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
are as high as 39 across the whole
 
05:52:57.048 --> 05:52:57.058 align:start position:0%
organization other positions that
 
05:52:59.448 --> 05:52:59.458 align:start position:0%
deserve recognition our chef positions
 
05:53:03.708 --> 05:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
are at 50 those chefs feed 5 700 meals a
 
05:53:07.430 --> 05:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
day yes with resident labor but they are
 
05:53:09.048 --> 05:53:09.058 align:start position:0%
the lead behind that project every
 
05:53:11.628 --> 05:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
single day we have a high vacancy rate
 
05:53:13.610 --> 05:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
in our Southern clinical team who
 
05:53:15.170 --> 05:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
provide those medication assisted
 
05:53:16.310 --> 05:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
treatment and other mental health
 
05:53:19.250 --> 05:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
disorder treatment services so in need
 
05:53:22.610 --> 05:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
of Rehabilitation and this over time is
 
05:53:24.110 --> 05:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
indicative of continuing to move the
 
05:53:26.628 --> 05:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
agency forward so overtime strategies
 
05:53:29.570 --> 05:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
we've engaged in we talk and ask all of
 
05:53:31.610 --> 05:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
our retirees if they want to come back
 
05:53:33.410 --> 05:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
and work part-time as long as they're in
 
05:53:35.628 --> 05:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
good standing and we have anywhere range
 
05:53:38.030 --> 05:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
from 19 to 25 people choose to do that
 
05:53:40.850 --> 05:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
that helps in any way shape or form as
 
05:53:42.350 --> 05:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
you can imagine based on both this
 
05:53:45.288 --> 05:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
Finance but that last year for example
 
05:53:49.970 --> 05:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
we had over 300 hours 300 000 hours of
 
05:53:51.650 --> 05:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
overtime across all sites that were
 
05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
filled by existing staff
 
05:53:55.730 --> 05:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
we've created new opportunities to use
 
05:53:58.368 --> 05:53:58.378 align:start position:0%
our group 2 Correctional line Personnel
 
05:54:02.208 --> 05:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
to do trained jobs such as one-on-one
 
05:54:05.990 --> 05:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
precautionary watches and or using them
 
05:54:08.510 --> 05:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
in control rooms that are not armed not
 
05:54:11.390 --> 05:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
weaponed posts that has helped fill some
 
05:54:13.910 --> 05:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
voids and allowed our correctional
 
05:54:16.368 --> 05:54:16.378 align:start position:0%
officers to go home which we do want
 
05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
them to have the chance to be with their
 
05:54:20.330 --> 05:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
families we continue to explore other
 
05:54:22.368 --> 05:54:22.378 align:start position:0%
opportunities to do that to advance the
 
05:54:24.530 --> 05:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
burden of the work that we do but to use
 
05:54:26.090 --> 05:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
people who are certified and trained to
 
05:54:27.590 --> 05:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
do the work we're not going to do that
 
05:54:29.208 --> 05:54:29.218 align:start position:0%
without providing appropriate
 
05:54:31.670 --> 05:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
certification to orient people to those
 
05:54:31.680 --> 05:54:32.708 align:start position:0%
certification to orient people to those
posts

05:54:32.708 --> 05:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
posts
 
05:54:35.150 --> 05:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
we've also taken that opportunity
 
05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
because our population has decreased
 
05:54:40.368 --> 05:54:40.378 align:start position:0%
over the last decade so significantly
 
05:54:42.230 --> 05:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
that we shut down the second floor of
 
05:54:43.910 --> 05:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
our Hancock building which was over a
 
05:54:45.830 --> 05:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
hundred beds that reduced our security
 
05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
post requirement by 14. now granted our
 
05:54:52.010 --> 05:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
our vacancy rate has gone up so absent
 
05:54:53.090 --> 05:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
that it would have been a worse
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
situation at our new women's prison
 
05:54:59.150 --> 05:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
facility we have closed a 56 bed C3
 
05:55:01.250 --> 05:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
General prison housing unit that reduced
 
05:55:02.628 --> 05:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
Us by approximately four and a half
 
05:55:04.850 --> 05:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
posts so we look for those opportunities
 
05:55:08.150 --> 05:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:10.250 --> 05:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
on Page Six
 
05:55:12.350 --> 05:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see our trended of new hire
 
05:55:14.750 --> 05:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
correction officer trainees uniform
 
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
staff terminations those are separations
 
05:55:20.090 --> 05:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
that could be people being recruited by
 
05:55:21.590 --> 05:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
other law enforcement to go to other
 
05:55:23.448 --> 05:55:23.458 align:start position:0%
agencies such as state troopers liquor
 
05:55:25.070 --> 05:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Municipal law
 
05:55:27.830 --> 05:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement and then staff retirements
 
05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
you can see that post the height of
 
05:55:32.628 --> 05:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
covid we had a large departure that was
 
05:55:34.510 --> 05:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
normal across the country
 
05:55:36.890 --> 05:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
and in
 
05:55:39.948 --> 05:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
an advanced news since October 7th that
 
05:55:41.868 --> 05:55:41.878 align:start position:0%
new hire corrections officer training
 
05:55:43.970 --> 05:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
number is now 12. so we've gone from 5
 
05:55:46.368 --> 05:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
to 12 just since October that's a good
 
05:55:46.378 --> 05:55:47.628 align:start position:0%
to 12 just since October that's a good
sign

05:55:47.628 --> 05:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
sign
 
05:55:49.548 --> 05:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
we've engaged in numerous Recruitment
 
05:55:51.170 --> 05:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
and Retention strategies we have
 
05:55:52.670 --> 05:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
recruitment retention committees

professions across our agency on the
 
05:55:59.270 --> 05:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
Southern Tier we have the same in our
 
05:56:02.270 --> 05:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
Northern organizations we participate I
 
05:56:03.770 --> 05:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
participate as well as other members of

Association Recruitment and Retention
 
05:56:08.628 --> 05:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
committee so we can learn from others
 
05:56:10.128 --> 05:56:10.138 align:start position:0%
what they're doing in their Corrections
 
05:56:11.990 --> 05:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
departments and what we can teach them
 
05:56:13.690 --> 05:56:13.700 align:start position:0%
about what we're doing in our department
 
05:56:16.430 --> 05:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
we've been very assertive in doing exit
 
05:56:18.530 --> 05:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
interviews we've increased our employee
 
05:56:20.510 --> 05:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
recognition both through their longevity
 
05:56:22.910 --> 05:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
and their acts of Valor as well as acts
 
05:56:24.770 --> 05:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
of kindness and any other acts in which
 
05:56:27.288 --> 05:56:27.298 align:start position:0%
we can appreciate employees we have
 
05:56:28.910 --> 05:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
enhanced our employee Communications
 
05:56:31.850 --> 05:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
we've established actual employee
 
05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
dedicated spaces some are still under
 
05:56:35.570 --> 05:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
construction with the hope of being
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
finished I think this week to give
 
05:56:40.548 --> 05:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
employees spaces without our
 
05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities that feel
 
05:56:44.208 --> 05:56:44.218 align:start position:0%
distinctly different than working in a
 
05:56:46.430 --> 05:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
prison tier every single day and they
 
05:56:47.810 --> 05:56:47.820 align:start position:0%
deserve that
 
05:56:50.330 --> 05:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
we have created a Leadership Academy and
 
05:56:52.310 --> 05:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
for employee development and that will
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
be deployed soon as well as Contracting
 
05:56:57.048 --> 05:56:57.058 align:start position:0%

telephone not a software product for
 
05:57:03.470 --> 05:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
your computer and we're um moving
 
05:57:04.970 --> 05:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
forward with establishing a family
 
05:57:07.730 --> 05:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
support organization and these are just
 
05:57:09.048 --> 05:57:09.058 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we have
 
05:57:11.390 --> 05:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
accomplished on page seven we can talk
 
05:57:13.730 --> 05:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
about our recruiting strategies we've
 
05:57:15.288 --> 05:57:15.298 align:start position:0%
had a dedicated part-time recruiting
 
05:57:17.208 --> 05:57:17.218 align:start position:0%

05:57:20.470 --> 05:57:20.480 align:start position:0%

fairs school events security onboarding
 
05:57:31.010 --> 05:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
and any other retention efforts we've
 
05:57:32.990 --> 05:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
updated our marketing materials so that
 
05:57:34.788 --> 05:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
we can show people that orange is not
 
05:57:36.048 --> 05:57:36.058 align:start position:0%
the New Black we are the New Hampshire
 
05:57:37.368 --> 05:57:37.378 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections a law
 
05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement organization full of
 
05:57:42.470 --> 05:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
professionals and we have even in 2021
 
05:57:45.048 --> 05:57:45.058 align:start position:0%
we went to 16 different job fairs and
 
05:57:47.330 --> 05:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
speaking engagements virtual Roar in
 
05:57:49.548 --> 05:57:49.558 align:start position:0%
person and from
 
05:57:52.128 --> 05:57:52.138 align:start position:0%
um it says calendar year 2022 we
 
05:57:54.590 --> 05:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
attended 91 and just looking at
 
05:57:57.590 --> 05:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
September through today uh those are 27
 
05:58:00.230 --> 05:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
different events that we've gone to
 
05:58:02.208 --> 05:58:02.218 align:start position:0%
uh to teach people about what
 
05:58:04.128 --> 05:58:04.138 align:start position:0%
Corrections is and opportunities to work
 
05:58:06.830 --> 05:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
with us we started an introductions to
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections program course that's
 
05:58:10.128 --> 05:58:10.138 align:start position:0%
offered at the Berlin High School on the
 
05:58:12.530 --> 05:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
Milan High School and those have been
 
05:58:13.670 --> 05:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
great opportunities for our North
 
05:58:16.070 --> 05:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
Country Partners as well as we have a
 
05:58:17.868 --> 05:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
standalone part-time corrections officer
 
05:58:19.670 --> 05:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
Academy that doesn't involve having
 
05:58:21.770 --> 05:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
retirees come back but that hasn't taken
 
05:58:23.390 --> 05:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
off and we're exploring what we can do
 
05:58:25.850 --> 05:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
to just make that a fully functional
 
05:58:27.350 --> 05:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for college students and
 
05:58:28.910 --> 05:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
people who are unsure if this is that
 
05:58:30.770 --> 05:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
profession they want to go in but we can
 
05:58:32.208 --> 05:58:32.218 align:start position:0%
get them in and get them in a limited
 
05:58:34.070 --> 05:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
post capacity and use them through a
 
05:58:36.590 --> 05:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
part-time corrections officer Academy we
 
05:58:38.570 --> 05:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
have increased and elevated our social
 
05:58:40.610 --> 05:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
media presence because that is a reality
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
of how people learn about what's going
 
05:58:43.548 --> 05:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
on in our world today but we do that
 
05:58:45.890 --> 05:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
through factual presentation and we've
 
05:58:47.690 --> 05:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
participated in local community events
 
05:58:49.850 --> 05:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
even just recently we received the
 
05:58:51.470 --> 05:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
number one Public Safety float in the
 
05:58:53.208 --> 05:58:53.218 align:start position:0%
Concord Christmas parade and yes I was
 
05:58:55.070 --> 05:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
the conductor of the correctional Polar
 
05:58:55.080 --> 05:58:56.390 align:start position:0%
the conductor of the correctional Polar
Express

05:58:56.390 --> 05:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
Express
 
05:58:59.570 --> 05:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh We've streamlined our job website for
 
05:59:02.030 --> 05:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
hiring and we're constantly looking at
 
05:59:03.590 --> 05:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities to improve our hiring
 
05:59:06.110 --> 05:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
process and keeping people engaged as we
 
05:59:07.850 --> 05:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
move along
 
05:59:09.948 --> 05:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
so we are fully committed to being a
 
05:59:11.750 --> 05:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
solution to our solution and I hope that
 
05:59:13.430 --> 05:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
those cards help you be part of our
 
05:59:14.990 --> 05:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
Solution by recruiting someone to our
 
05:59:16.850 --> 05:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
agency even if you want them in yours
 
05:59:20.030 --> 05:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
send them to ours on page eight I
 
05:59:21.770 --> 05:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
overview our medical and pharmaceutical
 
05:59:24.470 --> 05:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
services that averages about 12.8
 
05:59:26.510 --> 05:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
percent of our costs it's important to
 
05:59:28.128 --> 05:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
recognize our Health Care Partners are
 
05:59:29.570 --> 05:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
in the community and our community
 
05:59:31.430 --> 05:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
health care costs are predicated by the
 
05:59:34.010 --> 05:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
HealthCare Marketplace which that costs
 
05:59:36.048 --> 05:59:36.058 align:start position:0%
more and it goes up when we look at the
 
05:59:37.368 --> 05:59:37.378 align:start position:0%
center for Medicaid and Medicare
 
05:59:39.470 --> 05:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
Services cost projection as a way to try
 
05:59:41.270 --> 05:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
to understand where we're headed as a
 
05:59:43.990 --> 05:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
state as far as those costs are
 
05:59:46.128 --> 05:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
incurred to us for those that are in our
 
05:59:48.410 --> 05:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
care and custody it is important to also
 
05:59:49.910 --> 05:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
state that those who are incarcerated
 
05:59:51.890 --> 05:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
are the only population who have a
 
05:59:53.868 --> 05:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to the access to
 
05:59:56.410 --> 05:59:56.420 align:start position:0%
health care and we take that seriously
 
05:59:59.390 --> 05:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
we will continue to ask for the footnote
 
06:00:00.948 --> 06:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
that has allowed us to go back before
 
06:00:02.990 --> 06:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee if we have not been
 
06:00:05.570 --> 06:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
able to forecast expenditures so that we
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
can continue to cover those costs on
 
06:00:08.690 --> 06:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
behalf of the State of New Hampshire
 
06:00:10.548 --> 06:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
within our department
 
06:00:12.230 --> 06:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
um we have had some significant
 
06:00:13.610 --> 06:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
accomplishments there even though they
 
06:00:15.288 --> 06:00:15.298 align:start position:0%
weren't on the first page our medical
 
06:00:16.910 --> 06:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
forensics team has through the
 
06:00:18.110 --> 06:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
partnership with the Department of
 
06:00:20.208 --> 06:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
06:00:22.970 --> 06:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
um been approved for a 340b purchasing
 
06:00:24.590 --> 06:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity and we've targeted those
 
06:00:26.090 --> 06:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
with our
 
06:00:28.250 --> 06:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
um hepatitis C Drugs and we'll continue
 
06:00:29.690 --> 06:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
to look for opportunities to expand
 
06:00:31.670 --> 06:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
those because we can get Pharmaceuticals
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
as significantly reduced cost and that
 
06:00:36.288 --> 06:00:36.298 align:start position:0%
is our plan is to provide services to
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
reduce costs but provide effective
 
06:00:40.310 --> 06:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
treatment services
 
06:00:43.310 --> 06:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
on page nine we go over operational
 
06:00:45.410 --> 06:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
expenses that each cost perhaps more
 
06:00:47.390 --> 06:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
than a million dollars that represents
 
06:00:50.090 --> 06:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
about 9.4 percent of the budget food
 
06:00:52.128 --> 06:00:52.138 align:start position:0%
should not be a surprise the Commodities
 
06:00:53.810 --> 06:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
market around food has increased
 
06:00:55.610 --> 06:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
gasoline has increased and the way we
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
get things to in thither is costing us
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
all more
 
06:01:01.788 --> 06:01:01.798 align:start position:0%
current expense the things that we need
 
06:01:03.708 --> 06:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis those have gone up
 
06:01:06.288 --> 06:01:06.298 align:start position:0%
those numbers are there that is the
 
06:01:08.208 --> 06:01:08.218 align:start position:0%
consumables we experience every single
 
06:01:11.448 --> 06:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
day and this budget we use the
 
06:01:12.590 --> 06:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity with the three percent
 
06:01:14.810 --> 06:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
increase to really Target equipment that
 
06:01:17.448 --> 06:01:17.458 align:start position:0%
is old and needed to be replaced five
 
06:01:19.250 --> 06:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
years ago and that includes our fleet
 
06:01:21.230 --> 06:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles for our probation parole team
 
06:01:22.970 --> 06:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
our Industries team and our warehouse
 
06:01:26.330 --> 06:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
team so we take a very targeted Approach
 
06:01:28.730 --> 06:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
at our budget Target by trying to move
 
06:01:30.830 --> 06:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
some things forward in the next biennium
 
06:01:32.030 --> 06:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
budget that we've been trying to
 
06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
accomplish over the last several and it
 
06:01:36.530 --> 06:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
also includes improving infrastructure
 
06:01:38.868 --> 06:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
in our Dental Suite because our dental
 
06:01:42.830 --> 06:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
equipment is almost Beyond its aged use
 
06:01:44.628 --> 06:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
and that will come up in the next
 
06:01:46.850 --> 06:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
biennium budget and a dental chair is
 
06:01:50.510 --> 06:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
very expensive surprisingly enough
 
06:01:52.010 --> 06:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and we continue to look at the
 
06:01:54.170 --> 06:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
automation of our Pharmacy
 
06:01:57.170 --> 06:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
on page 10 I think everyone understands
 
06:01:59.810 --> 06:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
that utility costs have increased and
 
06:02:01.970 --> 06:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
are escalated I want to make it clear
 
06:02:04.070 --> 06:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Corrections we
 
06:02:06.650 --> 06:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
run small communities we run small
 
06:02:08.708 --> 06:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
communities we have
 
06:02:10.910 --> 06:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
numerous individuals living the same
 
06:02:13.368 --> 06:02:13.378 align:start position:0%
space moving through water electricity
 
06:02:17.288 --> 06:02:17.298 align:start position:0%
you name it we're using it our costs are
 
06:02:20.208 --> 06:02:20.218 align:start position:0%
impressive this year and we don't expect
 
06:02:24.170 --> 06:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
that to change in 2024 or 2025 included
 
06:02:26.628 --> 06:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
here is a similar budget but no we have
 
06:02:28.010 --> 06:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
not been afforded the opportunity to
 
06:02:29.690 --> 06:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
have in the past in which we want to be
 
06:02:32.510 --> 06:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
prepared as we move into 2024 and 2025
 
06:02:35.868 --> 06:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
which would allow us to look for
 
06:02:38.208 --> 06:02:38.218 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in that line moving
 
06:02:40.750 --> 06:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
forward if so needed
 
06:02:44.090 --> 06:02:44.100 align:start position:0%
in our office of Information Technology
 
06:02:47.750 --> 06:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
expenses we have similar expenses but
 
06:02:49.670 --> 06:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
multiple locations we have 10 district
 
06:02:52.368 --> 06:02:52.378 align:start position:0%
offices for probation and parole I I
 
06:02:54.110 --> 06:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
think it's important to recognize we
 
06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
don't just run prisons we run 10
 
06:02:57.590 --> 06:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
different district offices we want three
 
06:02:59.510 --> 06:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
prisons three transitional housing units
 
06:03:01.250 --> 06:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
a transitional work center and Partridge
 
06:03:03.128 --> 06:03:03.138 align:start position:0%
and a pear tree you name it we have it
 
06:03:05.390 --> 06:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
and it requires technological
 
06:03:07.610 --> 06:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the department had made
 
06:03:11.510 --> 06:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
grounds upgrading and um moving to what
 
06:03:14.330 --> 06:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
we call Base technology we lost some of
 
06:03:17.570 --> 06:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
that ground during 2020 and 2021 this
 
06:03:19.670 --> 06:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
budget tries to continue to move that
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
forward because with reduced Staffing we
 
06:03:23.330 --> 06:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
need to find efficient Technology
 
06:03:25.310 --> 06:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
Solutions to help them be more efficient
 
06:03:26.690 --> 06:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
in the work that they do while we
 
06:03:31.070 --> 06:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:33.948 --> 06:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
all right moving right along
 
06:03:35.628 --> 06:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
page 11.
 
06:03:37.670 --> 06:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
you'll find is our list of additional
 
06:03:40.250 --> 06:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs we forecast that we'll
 
06:03:42.708 --> 06:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
need more in our utilities line uh we'll
 
06:03:45.430 --> 06:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
need more in our oit expenses
 
06:03:48.590 --> 06:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
we have a fender Management Systems
 
06:03:51.350 --> 06:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
electronic health records we need new
 
06:03:52.910 --> 06:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
software for the in-service please
 
06:03:54.490 --> 06:03:54.500 align:start position:0%
stands and training councils
 
06:03:56.868 --> 06:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
requirements for law enforcement
 
06:03:59.510 --> 06:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
training we'll need to meet those and
 
06:04:01.730 --> 06:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
match those as our employees are under
 
06:04:04.430 --> 06:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
those requirements as well as use of
 
06:04:06.410 --> 06:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
fiscal Force reporting creating a
 
06:04:07.910 --> 06:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
transparent fast and efficient
 
06:04:10.368 --> 06:04:10.378 align:start position:0%
technological solution is part of
 
06:04:12.530 --> 06:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
keeping our staff in the work site so we
 
06:04:15.530 --> 06:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
can prove what happened and what did not
 
06:04:18.770 --> 06:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
happen in addition to there's a portion
 
06:04:20.448 --> 06:04:20.458 align:start position:0%
associated with our employee assistance
 
06:04:22.250 --> 06:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
program those are small amounts and our
 
06:04:23.810 --> 06:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
workman's comp those are an additional
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs as the agency wanted
 
06:04:28.368 --> 06:04:28.378 align:start position:0%
to dedicate its Target to the things the
 
06:04:30.590 --> 06:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
agency needed on a regular basis in to
 
06:04:32.448 --> 06:04:32.458 align:start position:0%
move the agency forward
 
06:04:36.770 --> 06:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
on the last page page 12 is a summary of
 
06:04:39.590 --> 06:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
everything I just discussed in detail
 
06:04:41.570 --> 06:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
for your reading pleasure it does not
 
06:04:43.430 --> 06:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
include the parole board as they are up
 
06:04:46.190 --> 06:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
next is my understanding with that I
 
06:04:47.628 --> 06:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
will certainly Avail myself to any
 
06:04:50.090 --> 06:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
questions you may have and thank you for
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
your time thank you very much
 
06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
um quick question here on page three at
 
06:04:58.868 --> 06:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
06:05:02.208 --> 06:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
you illustrate how prescription drugs
 
06:05:04.190 --> 06:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
and and medical payments to Providers
 
06:05:06.770 --> 06:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
from from 23 to 24 and 23 looks like
 
06:05:09.350 --> 06:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're going up about 10 percent in
 
06:05:12.170 --> 06:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
above for for prescription drugs and
 
06:05:14.570 --> 06:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
about maybe 50 for medical payments to
 
06:05:14.580 --> 06:05:15.650 align:start position:0%
about maybe 50 for medical payments to
providers

06:05:15.650 --> 06:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
providers
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
could you just briefly explain what's
 
06:05:21.170 --> 06:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
driving that number one and number two
 
06:05:22.850 --> 06:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
whether you've seen anything coming out
 
06:05:24.590 --> 06:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
of Washington whether it's the inflation
 
06:05:26.090 --> 06:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
reduction act or anything which are
 
06:05:28.610 --> 06:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
designed to bring down costs uh
 
06:05:30.048 --> 06:05:30.058 align:start position:0%
certainly prescription drugs and other
 
06:05:33.288 --> 06:05:33.298 align:start position:0%
medical procedures that will
 
06:05:36.470 --> 06:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
may change this number downward
 
06:05:38.448 --> 06:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
uh certainly that is a fair question
 
06:05:40.128 --> 06:05:40.138 align:start position:0%
part of the work that we have done is
 
06:05:42.830 --> 06:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
changed the statute to cap our payments
 
06:05:46.430 --> 06:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
in state law to Medicare plus 15 or
 
06:05:49.490 --> 06:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
Medicare plus 25 depending on what type
 
06:05:51.650 --> 06:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
of license provider you are the other
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
work we've done is we've worked with
 
06:05:55.788 --> 06:05:55.798 align:start position:0%
director Lipman of our state department
 
06:05:58.128 --> 06:05:58.138 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid and Medicare services to ask
 
06:05:59.990 --> 06:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government to Grant a waiver
 
06:06:02.448 --> 06:06:02.458 align:start position:0%
What's called the inmate exclusion which
 
06:06:04.850 --> 06:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
means we cannot use Medicaid for
 
06:06:06.410 --> 06:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
anything other than an inpatient
 
06:06:07.850 --> 06:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
eligible stay while someone is
 
06:06:10.310 --> 06:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and we've targeted what we
 
06:06:13.010 --> 06:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
call our re-entry encounters 45 days
 
06:06:14.750 --> 06:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
prior to release that we're asking
 
06:06:16.910 --> 06:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to Grant a waiver so that those
 
06:06:19.670 --> 06:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
people who are can be Medicaid eligible
 
06:06:21.910 --> 06:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
can have those encounters to reduce
 
06:06:24.770 --> 06:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
their reincarceration I reference
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder one of those
 
06:06:29.868 --> 06:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
encounters is mat and moud with a
 
06:06:32.030 --> 06:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
provider it's instinctual that if you
 
06:06:33.650 --> 06:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
meet your provider face to face you're
 
06:06:35.690 --> 06:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
likely to go see them again when they
 
06:06:37.310 --> 06:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
are a ghost appointment and you've never
 
06:06:39.530 --> 06:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
met them we have a disconnect Post
 
06:06:41.448 --> 06:06:41.458 align:start position:0%
Release onto supervision trying to get
 
06:06:43.128 --> 06:06:43.138 align:start position:0%
them to their providers so from the
 
06:06:45.170 --> 06:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
federal perspective those Medicaid
 
06:06:47.628 --> 06:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
waivers being asked for not just by New
 
06:06:49.128 --> 06:06:49.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but other states are important
 
06:06:50.570 --> 06:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
to the Continuum associated with
 
06:06:52.730 --> 06:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
corrections as far as rates of payment
 
06:06:54.650 --> 06:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
that's a tough question given the
 
06:06:56.510 --> 06:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
current HealthCare Marketplace and their
 
06:06:58.368 --> 06:06:58.378 align:start position:0%
shortage of staff were going to be
 
06:07:00.170 --> 06:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
driven by that same shortage of Staff
 
06:07:01.910 --> 06:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
but we're going to continue to look to
 
06:07:04.850 --> 06:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and hopeful that the state
 
06:07:07.128 --> 06:07:07.138 align:start position:0%
continues to reinvigorate Medicaid
 
06:07:08.750 --> 06:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
expansion because that is a critical
 
06:07:10.670 --> 06:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
resource and tool for Corrections and
 
06:07:12.470 --> 06:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
those leaving corrections as a pathway
 
06:07:14.990 --> 06:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise our state will be back in what
 
06:07:18.650 --> 06:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
I call the insurance Cliff there is no
 
06:07:20.690 --> 06:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
mechanism except for fee for service if
 
06:07:22.610 --> 06:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
the state does not reauthorize Medicaid
 
06:07:25.430 --> 06:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
expansion we as I mentioned have that
 
06:07:27.650 --> 06:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
340b purchasing opportunity we are
 
06:07:29.390 --> 06:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
looking to where we can expand that to
 
06:07:31.490 --> 06:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals but
 
06:07:33.470 --> 06:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
when we look at treatments for HIV and
 
06:07:35.510 --> 06:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
even hepatitis C and that being one of
 
06:07:37.990 --> 06:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
the primary hepatitis see
 
06:07:39.770 --> 06:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
infections that were fighting in
 
06:07:41.810 --> 06:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
Corrections those are recurring costs
 
06:07:43.610 --> 06:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
and are driven by the cost of those
 
06:07:43.620 --> 06:07:46.368 align:start position:0%
and are driven by the cost of those
Pharmaceuticals

06:07:46.368 --> 06:07:46.378 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals
 
06:07:48.288 --> 06:07:48.298 align:start position:0%
as far as Switching gears to Corrections
 
06:07:50.090 --> 06:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
Officers the number what are the number
 
06:07:51.770 --> 06:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
of Corrections Officers you have on
 
06:07:55.010 --> 06:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
staff today and then I realize that that
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
number is too low
 
06:07:59.570 --> 06:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh what is the ideal for what is the
 
06:08:02.090 --> 06:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
minimum number that you feel comfortable
 
06:08:04.548 --> 06:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
with the state having to meet the needs
 
06:08:06.770 --> 06:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
of your department the minimum number I
 
06:08:08.150 --> 06:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
will feel comfortable would be somewhere
 
06:08:10.490 --> 06:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
over the 500 Mark and right now we're
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
about 350. so filling the current funded
 
06:08:18.670 --> 06:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
positions is our most critical Mission
 
06:08:22.250 --> 06:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
once we fill those we'll come back and
 
06:08:24.830 --> 06:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
ask for more and that's been my
 
06:08:26.510 --> 06:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
presentation the whole time I've been
 
06:08:28.430 --> 06:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the department okay
 
06:08:33.170 --> 06:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:35.510 --> 06:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
hi hi
 
06:08:36.830 --> 06:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to ask you about being
 
06:08:38.868 --> 06:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
conductor on the Polar Express it was
 
06:08:40.610 --> 06:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
fun you're jealous
 
06:08:43.368 --> 06:08:43.378 align:start position:0%
a little bit maybe just a little bit you
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
could have no money like Scrooge
 
06:08:49.128 --> 06:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
I have a question about your
 
06:08:49.138 --> 06:08:50.690 align:start position:0%
I have a question about your
um

06:08:50.690 --> 06:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:52.670 --> 06:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
residence what's the right term guests
 
06:08:54.770 --> 06:08:54.780 align:start position:0%
president it's fine some aren't leaving
 
06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
yes residents thank you
 
06:09:01.430 --> 06:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
um your resident population over time is
 
06:09:04.490 --> 06:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
relatively stable declining increasing
 
06:09:06.708 --> 06:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
so it has been declining for over a
 
06:09:09.650 --> 06:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
decade we continue to monitor however
 
06:09:12.368 --> 06:09:12.378 align:start position:0%
what's going on post covid with
 
06:09:15.230 --> 06:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
Judiciary proceedings we've seen a
 
06:09:18.170 --> 06:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
slight uptick in parole violations but
 
06:09:19.788 --> 06:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
not a significant increase in new
 
06:09:21.650 --> 06:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
admissions for new crime but we watched
 
06:09:23.270 --> 06:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
that on a monthly basis
 
06:09:26.150 --> 06:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
so I say that we were already short
 
06:09:29.270 --> 06:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
staffed while it was going down so the
 
06:09:31.310 --> 06:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
population decreasing allowed us to shut
 
06:09:33.708 --> 06:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
down areas to help our short staffing
 
06:09:35.330 --> 06:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
but our short staffing has increased
 
06:09:37.850 --> 06:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
significantly since yeah I'm I didn't
 
06:09:39.170 --> 06:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
mean to draw a connection between the
 
06:09:40.730 --> 06:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
staffing issues to be clear that the
 
06:09:42.048 --> 06:09:42.058 align:start position:0%
public watching understands them
 
06:09:44.810 --> 06:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
probably a very important Point are
 
06:09:46.910 --> 06:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
there operational cost differences
 
06:09:46.920 --> 06:09:48.530 align:start position:0%
there operational cost differences
between

06:09:48.530 --> 06:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
between
 
06:09:48.540 --> 06:09:49.970 align:start position:0%
between
um

06:09:49.970 --> 06:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:52.548 --> 06:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
the men's facilities in Concord and the
 
06:09:54.410 --> 06:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
ones in Berlin
 
06:09:56.628 --> 06:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
significant significantly dramat okay
 
06:10:00.288 --> 06:10:00.298 align:start position:0%
from the perspective that given a more
 
06:10:00.298 --> 06:10:01.610 align:start position:0%
from the perspective that given a more
efficient

06:10:01.610 --> 06:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
06:10:03.590 --> 06:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
um design
 
06:10:06.230 --> 06:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the Concord Men's prison we don't
 
06:10:08.448 --> 06:10:08.458 align:start position:0%
know what gains we could make with the
 
06:10:11.510 --> 06:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
existing staff so
 
06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes and no the North Country facility
 
06:10:16.368 --> 06:10:16.378 align:start position:0%
was designed in 2000 it was designed
 
06:10:19.070 --> 06:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
clearly with efficiency in mind it was
 
06:10:20.810 --> 06:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
also designed so if we needed more
 
06:10:22.548 --> 06:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
housing units they could literally drop
 
06:10:24.830 --> 06:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
them in like a Lego set the New
 
06:10:26.208 --> 06:10:26.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men was
 
06:10:28.190 --> 06:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
designed to wasn't designed at all it
 
06:10:30.170 --> 06:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
was built over time and expanded upon
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
and is like a college campus which is
 
06:10:34.788 --> 06:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
the most inefficient design for
 
06:10:37.190 --> 06:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
Corrections Facility
 
06:10:43.910 --> 06:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:45.530 --> 06:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:10:48.350 --> 06:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you
 
06:11:10.430 --> 06:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:10.440 --> 06:11:27.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:11:27.190 --> 06:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:30.288 --> 06:11:30.298 align:start position:0%
good afternoon panel members my name is
 
06:11:32.990 --> 06:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
Roger Phillips and I'm chairman of the
 
06:11:36.410 --> 06:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
adult referral board with me today is
 
06:11:40.910 --> 06:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
Jade Mackey who's director of operations
 
06:11:46.190 --> 06:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
um for we submitted a uh basically a
 
06:11:50.150 --> 06:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
two-page uh memorandum here with us the
 
06:11:54.770 --> 06:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
support of request uh basically the our
 
06:11:54.780 --> 06:11:56.030 align:start position:0%
support of request uh basically the our
budget

06:11:56.030 --> 06:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
budget
 
06:11:58.990 --> 06:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
for the next Beyond biennium
 
06:12:01.190 --> 06:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
06:12:04.610 --> 06:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
is uh without priority needs is
 
06:12:06.890 --> 06:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
basically that's the same as it had been
 
06:12:06.900 --> 06:12:08.110 align:start position:0%
basically that's the same as it had been
in

06:12:08.110 --> 06:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:12:11.750 --> 06:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
2002-2003 uh I think it's a one and a
 
06:12:16.270 --> 06:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
half percent increase basically for for
 
06:12:19.610 --> 06:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
such things as interest travel costs
 
06:12:22.910 --> 06:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
both in-state and out of state and and
 
06:12:26.990 --> 06:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
really some minimal things like uh in
 
06:12:30.670 --> 06:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
the event we needed a translator to have
 
06:12:33.230 --> 06:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
a little money in the budget to do that
 
06:12:35.990 --> 06:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then a little money in the budget to
 
06:12:40.070 --> 06:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
do overtime our prioritized requests of
 
06:12:42.350 --> 06:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned with
 
06:12:46.610 --> 06:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
um and and that the
 
06:12:48.770 --> 06:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
the first one which doesn't require
 
06:12:50.930 --> 06:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
legislative action and the other one
 
06:12:56.570 --> 06:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
that that does require uh we we need
 
06:13:00.350 --> 06:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
another person in the six-member parole
 
06:13:05.448 --> 06:13:05.458 align:start position:0%
office uh another staff person a CCM
 
06:13:09.430 --> 06:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:12.708 --> 06:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
memorandum a request I think outlines
 
06:13:17.330 --> 06:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
the duties of the CCM
 
06:13:20.030 --> 06:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
what happens is that one person is
 
06:13:23.930 --> 06:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
assigned the responsibility of preparing
 
06:13:27.850 --> 06:13:27.860 align:start position:0%
parole packets it's a very uh
 
06:13:31.128 --> 06:13:31.138 align:start position:0%
time-consuming intense project there are
 
06:13:32.930 --> 06:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
only there are more than 23 different
 
06:13:36.350 --> 06:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
categories a lot of information has come
 
06:13:39.410 --> 06:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
from the chorus system uh so that we can
 
06:13:41.810 --> 06:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
put that together so Pro board members
 
06:13:41.820 --> 06:13:42.730 align:start position:0%
put that together so Pro board members
can

06:13:42.730 --> 06:13:42.740 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:13:46.970 --> 06:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
can make a decision as to whether or not
 
06:13:50.270 --> 06:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
parole should be should be granted or
 
06:13:50.280 --> 06:13:50.990 align:start position:0%
parole should be should be granted or
not

06:13:50.990 --> 06:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:13:54.650 --> 06:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
as best we Pro board members as best we
 
06:13:58.010 --> 06:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
can try to predict future behavior and
 
06:14:00.650 --> 06:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's really based upon the behavior of
 
06:14:03.490 --> 06:14:03.500 align:start position:0%
the past and then the rehabilitation
 
06:14:08.330 --> 06:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
that occurred within the prison system
 
06:14:12.650 --> 06:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
so that what I am really concerned about
 
06:14:15.948 --> 06:14:15.958 align:start position:0%
is that in this the person who who's
 
06:14:19.270 --> 06:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
done this who does it now
 
06:14:23.090 --> 06:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
it's just kind of a rough job it's
 
06:14:26.628 --> 06:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
really labor of intensive and it's very
 
06:14:26.638 --> 06:14:28.610 align:start position:0%
really labor of intensive and it's very
stressful

06:14:28.610 --> 06:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
stressful
 
06:14:30.530 --> 06:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
um and the two people who had done this
 
06:14:34.250 --> 06:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
before left the parole office really
 
06:14:38.270 --> 06:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
because of stress related reasons I
 
06:14:39.590 --> 06:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
06:14:42.770 --> 06:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
I want to prevent burnout and I think
 
06:14:45.530 --> 06:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's extremely important to have this
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
position approved
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
the other positions really concern
 
06:14:52.628 --> 06:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
legislative action
 
06:14:57.610 --> 06:14:57.620 align:start position:0%
and that is when the a few years ago
 
06:15:00.730 --> 06:15:00.740 align:start position:0%
2002 when they when
 
06:15:04.030 --> 06:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
we change the
 
06:15:06.548 --> 06:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
parole board from a nine member
 
06:15:11.030 --> 06:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
essentially voluntary position to a to a
 
06:15:15.890 --> 06:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
five-member uh paid position
 
06:15:19.368 --> 06:15:19.378 align:start position:0%
um the the initial proposal was would
 
06:15:22.490 --> 06:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
was that they were going to receive 30
 
06:15:25.128 --> 06:15:25.138 align:start position:0%
000 per year that was reduced in
 
06:15:29.330 --> 06:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
committee to to 20. we have really very
 
06:15:31.670 --> 06:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
fortunate in having an excellent parole
 
06:15:34.670 --> 06:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
office and an excellent parole board but
 
06:15:36.708 --> 06:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
I'm really concerned that I want to keep
 
06:15:38.930 --> 06:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
it that way I think it's really in the
 
06:15:41.448 --> 06:15:41.458 align:start position:0%
best interest of New Hampshire to do
 
06:15:44.330 --> 06:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
that there'll be a position that opens
 
06:15:47.990 --> 06:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
up in 2023 hopefully that the person
 
06:15:50.090 --> 06:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
who's there now would would be willing
 
06:15:52.850 --> 06:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
to continue on but that's why we're
 
06:15:55.250 --> 06:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
we're asking for that in increased
 
06:15:58.310 --> 06:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
compensation and the other thing is that
 
06:16:00.170 --> 06:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
I think there ought to be some
 
06:16:02.390 --> 06:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
compensation for the vice chair of the
 
06:16:04.250 --> 06:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
parole board
 
06:16:08.208 --> 06:16:08.218 align:start position:0%
um and we also that asked that that made
 
06:16:10.730 --> 06:16:10.740 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars more than the the
 
06:16:13.670 --> 06:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
parole member uh and then the other
 
06:16:16.368 --> 06:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
final thing for uh
 
06:16:20.330 --> 06:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
statutory Amendment concerns that that
 
06:16:22.190 --> 06:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
once in a while I think it happened
 
06:16:26.090 --> 06:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
three times last in this past year that
 
06:16:29.330 --> 06:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
we we couldn't put together a three uh
 
06:16:31.970 --> 06:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
member board which is required for our
 
06:16:33.610 --> 06:16:33.620 align:start position:0%
hearings because
 
06:16:37.310 --> 06:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
of sickness or other reasons for
 
06:16:40.430 --> 06:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
unavailability uh and we had to cancel a
 
06:16:43.788 --> 06:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
a hearing day and so that I had proposed
 
06:16:46.190 --> 06:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
that perhaps we could call those who had
 
06:16:48.830 --> 06:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
previously served in that position to
 
06:16:52.610 --> 06:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
fill to fill in and that I don't think
 
06:16:54.650 --> 06:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
that would happen very often but it's a
 
06:16:57.048 --> 06:16:57.058 align:start position:0%
really just a fifteen hundred dollar
 
06:16:59.810 --> 06:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
item that we we propose for that if we
 
06:17:01.910 --> 06:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
could just call on him and that would be
 
06:17:04.190 --> 06:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
a lot less expensive than increasing the
 
06:17:06.590 --> 06:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
number of of pro board members and I
 
06:17:09.048 --> 06:17:09.058 align:start position:0%
think would be uh an appropriate
 
06:17:09.058 --> 06:17:11.570 align:start position:0%
think would be uh an appropriate
solution

06:17:11.570 --> 06:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:14.510 --> 06:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that's it for my five minutes
 
06:17:17.570 --> 06:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
but but happy to answer any questions
 
06:17:19.490 --> 06:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
all right thank you a couple couple
 
06:17:21.770 --> 06:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
questions uh how
 
06:17:24.708 --> 06:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
on average in a rough estimate does a
 
06:17:26.048 --> 06:17:26.058 align:start position:0%
parole board
 
06:17:29.270 --> 06:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
member work per week on proboard
 
06:17:34.548 --> 06:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
activities well it it varies obviously
 
06:17:37.670 --> 06:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
there we always have hearings on
 
06:17:39.650 --> 06:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays and Thursdays so statute
 
06:17:42.410 --> 06:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
requires we have 36 herrings we've we
 
06:17:46.490 --> 06:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
normally have 45 or more per year
 
06:17:46.500 --> 06:17:47.530 align:start position:0%
normally have 45 or more per year
um

06:17:47.530 --> 06:17:47.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:52.250 --> 06:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
It Isn't So Much the hearing day time as
 
06:17:54.708 --> 06:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
much as the preparation time for those
 
06:17:56.868 --> 06:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
hairs especially for parole hearings
 
06:18:00.830 --> 06:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
those those digital packets uh consist
 
06:18:03.948 --> 06:18:03.958 align:start position:0%
of you know up to 60 Pages there's a lot
 
06:18:06.788 --> 06:18:06.798 align:start position:0%
to read without even getting into the
 
06:18:09.708 --> 06:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
through the other so
 
06:18:13.810 --> 06:18:13.820 align:start position:0%
um it's not a 40 Hour Week by any means
 
06:18:17.570 --> 06:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
but it's I would if it's really three
 
06:18:20.150 --> 06:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
and a half to four days depending upon
 
06:18:22.250 --> 06:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
whether they have to sit one or two days
 
06:18:25.010 --> 06:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
that week
 
06:18:26.810 --> 06:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
okay and the composition of the pro
 
06:18:29.150 --> 06:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
board are attorneys
 
06:18:32.270 --> 06:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
the composition is is they require two
 
06:18:35.750 --> 06:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys also they require someone with
 
06:18:37.910 --> 06:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
either law enforcement or Correctional
 
06:18:43.368 --> 06:18:43.378 align:start position:0%
background also someone who is is in the
 
06:18:46.010 --> 06:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
criminal justice field perhaps a teacher
 
06:18:50.030 --> 06:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
or or something and then someone without
 
06:18:52.490 --> 06:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
any official designation as a general
 
06:18:55.970 --> 06:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
member okay right now we're fortunate in
 
06:18:58.670 --> 06:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
in having a someone who is a retired
 
06:19:02.150 --> 06:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
happen from
 
06:19:05.990 --> 06:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
California of San Quentin who is
 
06:19:08.448 --> 06:19:08.458 align:start position:0%
extremely knowledgeable in these matters
 
06:19:10.788 --> 06:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
representing Correctional side we also
 
06:19:15.110 --> 06:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
have uh uh someone who served as a
 
06:19:19.670 --> 06:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
police officer who's now uh trading uh
 
06:19:25.010 --> 06:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
in in criminal justice who teaches at a
 
06:19:25.020 --> 06:19:25.810 align:start position:0%
in in criminal justice who teaches at a
college

06:19:25.810 --> 06:19:25.820 align:start position:0%
college
 
06:19:29.030 --> 06:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then we also have a retired surgeon
 
06:19:32.930 --> 06:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
who's sitting on that I bought we have a
 
06:19:35.930 --> 06:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
really a dedicated board and
 
06:19:38.868 --> 06:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm pleased with with that's going on
 
06:19:40.430 --> 06:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
but I want to make sure that we can
 
06:19:42.288 --> 06:19:42.298 align:start position:0%
continue in that fashion
 
06:19:44.628 --> 06:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:19:44.638 --> 06:19:46.070 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
yeah

06:19:46.070 --> 06:19:46.080 align:start position:0%

I'm good I just want to say thank you
 
06:19:49.250 --> 06:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
for your service the parole board's been
 
06:19:51.890 --> 06:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
through some ups and downs lately and
 
06:19:54.430 --> 06:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see it on and up
 
06:19:58.128 --> 06:19:58.138 align:start position:0%
well I I would be remiss if I didn't
 
06:20:02.090 --> 06:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank the commissioner of the of the
 
06:20:03.650 --> 06:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction and her staff
 
06:20:05.750 --> 06:20:05.760 align:start position:0%

06:20:09.110 --> 06:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
course I've had to call you and in in
 
06:20:12.708 --> 06:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
August to find out how do I for this is
 
06:20:14.930 --> 06:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
my you know I was disappointed in April
 
06:20:16.850 --> 06:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
but so this is my first time with the
 
06:20:18.590 --> 06:20:18.600 align:start position:0%

and seeing people work together on a
 
06:20:28.430 --> 06:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
common goal right I think it's working
 
06:20:33.830 --> 06:20:33.840 align:start position:0%

06:27:19.980 --> 06:27:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:27:23.750 --> 06:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:26.030 --> 06:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
yeah good afternoon I'd like to
 
06:27:27.830 --> 06:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
reconvene the governor's budget hearing
 
06:27:30.770 --> 06:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
up next is the Department of
 
06:27:32.810 --> 06:27:32.820 align:start position:0%

06:27:35.270 --> 06:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
and good afternoon
 
06:27:37.670 --> 06:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Charlie arlinghaus I'm the
 
06:27:39.350 --> 06:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative services
 
06:27:43.430 --> 06:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
and joining me is Cassie Keane I'm the
 
06:27:45.830 --> 06:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner and then I would
 
06:27:49.430 --> 06:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
just note for the for the record that
 
06:27:52.250 --> 06:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
um it's only half the room is employed
 
06:27:53.690 --> 06:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
by the department of administrative
 
06:27:56.270 --> 06:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
Services most of the rest of the people
 
06:27:57.650 --> 06:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
in the room are administratively
 
06:27:59.110 --> 06:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
attached to us
 
06:28:01.610 --> 06:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
and then the only other people are
 
06:28:04.010 --> 06:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
people who will soon work for us if I
 
06:28:05.270 --> 06:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
get my way
 
06:28:05.280 --> 06:28:07.190 align:start position:0%
get my way
so

06:28:07.190 --> 06:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:28:07.200 --> 06:28:08.230 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:28:08.230 --> 06:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:11.150 --> 06:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
we're a complicated agency and I like to
 
06:28:13.250 --> 06:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
start presentations with
 
06:28:16.430 --> 06:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
um a big giant sheet of paper which is
 
06:28:19.010 --> 06:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
the org chart for our organization and I
 
06:28:21.410 --> 06:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
and I do that because uh first of all
 
06:28:23.090 --> 06:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
because if it's on a regular size sheet
 
06:28:25.730 --> 06:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
of paper it's completely unreadable
 
06:28:27.948 --> 06:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
um which says something about our
 
06:28:30.350 --> 06:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
organization I think that if you put us
 
06:28:32.990 --> 06:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
on a regular sheet we're unreadable
 
06:28:35.930 --> 06:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
um we're a large complicated and diverse
 
06:28:38.510 --> 06:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
agency and my presentation will talk a
 
06:28:40.330 --> 06:28:40.340 align:start position:0%
little bit about why
 
06:28:43.730 --> 06:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
oh who I think is where we start
 
06:28:45.650 --> 06:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
um Sherry helped with the slides and She
 
06:28:49.430 --> 06:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
Came Upon This who why what where that's
 
06:28:50.868 --> 06:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
the organizing game if you're clever
 
06:28:53.448 --> 06:28:53.458 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that in the presentation
 
06:28:53.458 --> 06:28:54.230 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that in the presentation
um

06:28:54.230 --> 06:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:56.510 --> 06:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're a big diverse agency that's kind
 
06:28:58.610 --> 06:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
of hard to describe to people and I I
 
06:29:00.110 --> 06:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
let me start with something I do want to
 
06:29:02.628 --> 06:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
I do in an interview
 
06:29:04.610 --> 06:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
um typically Cassie and I are sharing I
 
06:29:05.930 --> 06:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
do a final interview with everybody we
 
06:29:07.670 --> 06:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
hire and part of what we do is talk
 
06:29:09.410 --> 06:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
about the parts of the agency they don't
 
06:29:13.128 --> 06:29:13.138 align:start position:0%
know we have eight major divisions right
 
06:29:13.138 --> 06:29:13.910 align:start position:0%
know we have eight major divisions right
um

06:29:13.910 --> 06:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:17.270 --> 06:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
and they run a gamut and uh the who who
 
06:29:19.670 --> 06:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
we are a central Service Agency explains
 
06:29:21.350 --> 06:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
who they are we start with Healthcare
 
06:29:23.090 --> 06:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
the division of risk and benefits does a
 
06:29:24.708 --> 06:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
lot of things right they do workers comp
 
06:29:26.690 --> 06:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
they do lots of insurance
 
06:29:28.490 --> 06:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
um but first and foremost and the thing
 
06:29:29.810 --> 06:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
that's probably important to everybody
 
06:29:32.390 --> 06:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
who has appeared today and will appear
 
06:29:35.330 --> 06:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is we run a 500 million dollar
 
06:29:37.010 --> 06:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
per biennium probably a little bit more
 
06:29:39.650 --> 06:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
than that now health plan it is a
 
06:29:41.090 --> 06:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
central component of our benefits
 
06:29:43.430 --> 06:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
package and the benefits package is one
 
06:29:44.750 --> 06:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that attracts people to
 
06:29:46.548 --> 06:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
work for the state of New Hampshire it's
 
06:29:48.890 --> 06:29:48.900 align:start position:0%
in large part why I'm here except my
 
06:29:50.750 --> 06:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
Love of All Things administratively
 
06:29:54.288 --> 06:29:54.298 align:start position:0%
serviced too but that's a big piece of
 
06:29:56.390 --> 06:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
it it's a very complicated Endeavor and
 
06:29:58.190 --> 06:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's something that is that that we do
 
06:29:59.930 --> 06:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
accounting we do all of the state's
 
06:30:01.310 --> 06:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
accounting the division of accounting
 
06:30:03.650 --> 06:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
services is a function it's actually the
 
06:30:05.990 --> 06:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
core of how our agency started
 
06:30:07.910 --> 06:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
um to have a state budget and didn't
 
06:30:09.470 --> 06:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
used to be a Governor's budget before
 
06:30:11.570 --> 06:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
that and agencies would sort of spend
 
06:30:13.010 --> 06:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
and then accidentally run out of money
 
06:30:15.650 --> 06:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
people decided that was a bad idea we
 
06:30:17.510 --> 06:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
came up with systems of pre-auditing and
 
06:30:20.810 --> 06:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
encumbrances and and whatnot we pay 13
 
06:30:22.730 --> 06:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
000 people every two weeks it's a lot of
 
06:30:25.128 --> 06:30:25.138 align:start position:0%
people and a lot of pay and it's and
 
06:30:27.770 --> 06:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's uh something that happens without
 
06:30:30.470 --> 06:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
anyone noticing but is an enormous
 
06:30:34.010 --> 06:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
amount of work constantly correcting
 
06:30:36.770 --> 06:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
issues so somebody accidentally doesn't
 
06:30:39.470 --> 06:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
get paid two million dollars one day
 
06:30:41.390 --> 06:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
um although if it's me I invest them not
 
06:30:43.070 --> 06:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
to correct that
 
06:30:44.448 --> 06:30:44.458 align:start position:0%
um although I think I think I'd have to
 
06:30:46.190 --> 06:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
give it back so that's not that's a work
 
06:30:48.708 --> 06:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
but we you know we pre-audit a couple
 
06:30:51.110 --> 06:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand payments every year now
 
06:30:52.548 --> 06:30:52.558 align:start position:0%
running the state of New Hampshire is an
 
06:30:54.410 --> 06:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
enormous operation there's a lot behind
 
06:30:56.690 --> 06:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
the scenes the State Comptroller in some
 
06:30:59.390 --> 06:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh States is an elected official here
 
06:31:00.650 --> 06:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
it's an employee of administrative
 
06:31:00.660 --> 06:31:01.810 align:start position:0%
it's an employee of administrative
Services

06:31:01.810 --> 06:31:01.820 align:start position:0%
Services
 
06:31:05.150 --> 06:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
software the the Machinery the software
 
06:31:07.970 --> 06:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
that runs everything that we do not the
 
06:31:10.548 --> 06:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
state's Financial system but yes not the
 
06:31:12.890 --> 06:31:12.900 align:start position:0%
state's budget system but yes not to say
 
06:31:14.390 --> 06:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
its Personnel system but yes but
 
06:31:17.090 --> 06:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
everything the state does is run by a
 
06:31:18.110 --> 06:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
division that we call Enterprise
 
06:31:20.570 --> 06:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
applications management occasionally it
 
06:31:22.850 --> 06:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
used to be called fdm it's not just
 
06:31:25.310 --> 06:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
financial data it's everything
 
06:31:28.670 --> 06:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
and we do that facility management
 
06:31:30.770 --> 06:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
um where there'll be a big piece of my
 
06:31:33.350 --> 06:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
presentation in a slide or two and we
 
06:31:34.910 --> 06:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
manage more than four million square
 
06:31:36.288 --> 06:31:36.298 align:start position:0%
feet of office space two and a half
 
06:31:38.150 --> 06:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
million ballpark in the city of Concord
 
06:31:38.160 --> 06:31:39.410 align:start position:0%
million ballpark in the city of Concord
Alone

06:31:39.410 --> 06:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
Alone
 
06:31:41.990 --> 06:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
um 90 buildings and that's uh Cameron
 
06:31:43.850 --> 06:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
Tamaki who's probably somewhere where
 
06:31:45.350 --> 06:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm pointing
 
06:31:47.690 --> 06:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
um and she's here because uh
 
06:31:49.548 --> 06:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
um at some point out it gets complicated
 
06:31:51.770 --> 06:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
and I will need her help in making sure
 
06:31:54.170 --> 06:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
I don't say anything stupid
 
06:31:57.048 --> 06:31:57.058 align:start position:0%
um which I might be too late for already
 
06:31:59.930 --> 06:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
um purchasing we buy stuff the state
 
06:32:02.030 --> 06:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
purchasing agent was one of the first
 
06:32:04.910 --> 06:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
pieces of centralization in the state or
 
06:32:07.970 --> 06:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
some also to speak in 1915 and the idea
 
06:32:10.190 --> 06:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
that that we should buy things we should
 
06:32:12.350 --> 06:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
we should procure competitively for two
 
06:32:14.810 --> 06:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
reasons one is we procure competitively
 
06:32:17.448 --> 06:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
so that we get a good price we get a
 
06:32:19.490 --> 06:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
good product and so everybody's got a
 
06:32:20.690 --> 06:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
shot of the state's business it's
 
06:32:23.448 --> 06:32:23.458 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars and uh we have no right
 
06:32:25.310 --> 06:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
we have no ability we have no uh
 
06:32:27.830 --> 06:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
justification for making sure that that
 
06:32:29.810 --> 06:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
a company that we trust and like gets
 
06:32:31.850 --> 06:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
the business all the time everybody gets
 
06:32:34.250 --> 06:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
a shot because it's taxpayer dollars
 
06:32:36.470 --> 06:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
this is a very large and complicated
 
06:32:38.330 --> 06:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
agency it gets more and more complicated
 
06:32:40.670 --> 06:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
to the government Council sees some
 
06:32:42.590 --> 06:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
contracts and they see more and more
 
06:32:42.600 --> 06:32:44.270 align:start position:0%
contracts and they see more and more
every

06:32:44.270 --> 06:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
every
 
06:32:45.890 --> 06:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
um every time they meet they decide
 
06:32:47.150 --> 06:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
there's another group that they want to
 
06:32:49.090 --> 06:32:49.100 align:start position:0%
see and it ends up being a lot more work
 
06:32:52.670 --> 06:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
personnel uh personnel has featured most
 
06:32:55.250 --> 06:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
of today in this hearing and discussing
 
06:32:58.490 --> 06:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
Personnel we we hire people we make sure
 
06:33:01.548 --> 06:33:01.558 align:start position:0%
we hire people correctly we we make sure
 
06:33:03.350 --> 06:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
we pay people correctly we make sure we
 
06:33:05.270 --> 06:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
have policies and procedures we try to
 
06:33:06.590 --> 06:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
work from people a lot of people are
 
06:33:08.390 --> 06:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
retiring we try to recruit them as best
 
06:33:09.708 --> 06:33:09.718 align:start position:0%
we can
 
06:33:11.628 --> 06:33:11.638 align:start position:0%
um to fill in for the people retiring
 
06:33:14.590 --> 06:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
there are now 14 unions in the state
 
06:33:17.090 --> 06:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
employee relations was set up in the mid
 
06:33:20.090 --> 06:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
70s when there was when there were two
 
06:33:22.190 --> 06:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
one or two in the sca and then the
 
06:33:24.470 --> 06:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
Troopers now there are 14 unions it's a
 
06:33:26.990 --> 06:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining is a massively
 
06:33:28.850 --> 06:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
complicated Endeavor both for management
 
06:33:30.770 --> 06:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
and employees and the employee
 
06:33:32.930 --> 06:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
Representatives it's a big piece of what
 
06:33:36.288 --> 06:33:36.298 align:start position:0%
we do budget control you perhaps are
 
06:33:39.230 --> 06:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with this Mr chairman
 
06:33:41.090 --> 06:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
um and various sundry people around the
 
06:33:43.250 --> 06:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
room are familiar but the state budget
 
06:33:45.288 --> 06:33:45.298 align:start position:0%
office and our state budget officer is
 
06:33:46.788 --> 06:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
point I think I'm pointing in the
 
06:33:49.010 --> 06:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
general vicinity of who doesn't just
 
06:33:51.650 --> 06:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
keep me from using yardsticks but um
 
06:33:54.530 --> 06:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
manage the state budget process we do an
 
06:33:56.330 --> 06:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of fiscal control for
 
06:33:57.830 --> 06:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire it's a
 
06:33:59.890 --> 06:33:59.900 align:start position:0%
central part of our mission
 
06:34:02.750 --> 06:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
and budgets go really well we enjoy them
 
06:34:04.670 --> 06:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
but they go really well Public Works we
 
06:34:05.868 --> 06:34:05.878 align:start position:0%
build stuff
 
06:34:09.230 --> 06:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
design engineering construction we don't
 
06:34:10.548 --> 06:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
build roads and bridges but we build
 
06:34:13.070 --> 06:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
everything else and it's a massively
 
06:34:15.170 --> 06:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
complicated thing that we do we have
 
06:34:16.670 --> 06:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
engineers and Architects working for us
 
06:34:18.048 --> 06:34:18.058 align:start position:0%
we have accountants who work for us we
 
06:34:19.910 --> 06:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
have purchasing agents we have
 
06:34:22.610 --> 06:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
budgeteers we have picked something we
 
06:34:23.868 --> 06:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
got it
 
06:34:25.730 --> 06:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm not mentioning all the
 
06:34:28.190 --> 06:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
other little things we do on the big
 
06:34:29.690 --> 06:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
giant org chart you see in front of you
 
06:34:31.850 --> 06:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
there's a list of every nook and cranny
 
06:34:34.670 --> 06:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
you can possibly imagine 10 or 15 things
 
06:34:36.890 --> 06:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
I don't do I haven't talked about and I
 
06:34:38.990 --> 06:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
probably won't today but we are like a
 
06:34:40.670 --> 06:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
giant English muffin of state government
 
06:34:43.490 --> 06:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
we have lots of tiny nooks and crannies
 
06:34:45.470 --> 06:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the peanut butter if you like it
 
06:34:48.288 --> 06:34:48.298 align:start position:0%
that way will melt itself into that's
 
06:34:50.350 --> 06:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
how I like my English muffins
 
06:34:53.390 --> 06:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
but it's a great complicated thing what
 
06:34:54.708 --> 06:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
do all those things have in common it's
 
06:34:56.330 --> 06:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
a little weird isn't it if you think of
 
06:34:58.490 --> 06:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
everything that we do it's it's almost
 
06:34:59.930 --> 06:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
like they just assigned everything and
 
06:35:02.208 --> 06:35:02.218 align:start position:0%
couldn't think of where else to put to
 
06:35:04.010 --> 06:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
this one agency but there is a rhyme and
 
06:35:05.810 --> 06:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
there is a reason to what it does we're
 
06:35:08.628 --> 06:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
Central Service Agency we don't regulate
 
06:35:10.490 --> 06:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
Banks we don't sell lottery tickets we
 
06:35:11.690 --> 06:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
don't limit the state's Medicaid Program
 
06:35:13.670 --> 06:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
we don't run a prison none of those
 
06:35:15.048 --> 06:35:15.058 align:start position:0%
people can do their job if we don't do
 
06:35:17.030 --> 06:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
ours I believe that very strongly and
 
06:35:19.128 --> 06:35:19.138 align:start position:0%
sincerely and that adds an ability to
 
06:35:21.410 --> 06:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
what we do and that's a tremendous sense
 
06:35:23.990 --> 06:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
of Mission to what we do we are that
 
06:35:25.610 --> 06:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
Central Service Agency we're not a
 
06:35:27.948 --> 06:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
central Service Agency we are the
 
06:35:29.990 --> 06:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
central Service Agency
 
06:35:33.410 --> 06:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
and that gets into why you should care
 
06:35:33.420 --> 06:35:34.368 align:start position:0%
and that gets into why you should care
um

06:35:34.368 --> 06:35:34.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:35.990 --> 06:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
why you should care is not just because
 
06:35:36.890 --> 06:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
we're the first Department
 
06:35:36.900 --> 06:35:38.830 align:start position:0%
we're the first Department
alphabetically

06:35:38.830 --> 06:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
alphabetically
 
06:35:41.510 --> 06:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
although that's a good thing too but
 
06:35:43.850 --> 06:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
every agency relies on the processes and
 
06:35:46.128 --> 06:35:46.138 align:start position:0%
procedures and approvals and whatnot
 
06:35:47.868 --> 06:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
that come out of administrative Services
 
06:35:49.910 --> 06:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
they're Central to their mission we're
 
06:35:51.350 --> 06:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
aware of that every day and we try to
 
06:35:53.628 --> 06:35:53.638 align:start position:0%
make sure that we keep it in mind every
 
06:35:55.490 --> 06:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
day that we make differences big and
 
06:35:59.690 --> 06:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
small no matter how big or small you are
 
06:36:01.730 --> 06:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
um the state and its policy makers rely
 
06:36:04.368 --> 06:36:04.378 align:start position:0%
on us on a regular basis to know the
 
06:36:06.170 --> 06:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
answers to questions
 
06:36:07.490 --> 06:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
um cherries had to run out of the room
 
06:36:09.530 --> 06:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
two or three times from elected
 
06:36:11.930 --> 06:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
officials asking her questions and doing
 
06:36:13.670 --> 06:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
little minor research projects for her
 
06:36:15.830 --> 06:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
for them
 
06:36:18.170 --> 06:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
um she's doing for them
 
06:36:20.270 --> 06:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
um but our we are a fiscal policy and
 
06:36:23.150 --> 06:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
control organization that that um
 
06:36:25.190 --> 06:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
that manages the laws the rules the
 
06:36:27.470 --> 06:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
regulations of the state
 
06:36:27.480 --> 06:36:28.070 align:start position:0%
regulations of the state
um

06:36:28.070 --> 06:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:32.208 --> 06:36:32.218 align:start position:0%
we do a really good job I expect way too
 
06:36:34.090 --> 06:36:34.100 align:start position:0%
much out of the people
 
06:36:36.708 --> 06:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
who work at administrative services and
 
06:36:39.048 --> 06:36:39.058 align:start position:0%
I get more than I expect
 
06:36:41.810 --> 06:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
um because I have I I said two years ago
 
06:36:43.730 --> 06:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
in this budget hearing all the smartest
 
06:36:45.548 --> 06:36:45.558 align:start position:0%
people in state government work for me
 
06:36:48.830 --> 06:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
and and then I said to somebody well or
 
06:36:50.030 --> 06:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
will soon
 
06:36:52.310 --> 06:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
and uh and I but I think it's true I
 
06:36:54.708 --> 06:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
have uh it's a tremendous place to work
 
06:36:56.570 --> 06:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
because of the tremendous staff but a
 
06:36:59.150 --> 06:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
lot is expected of us and it's and and
 
06:37:01.490 --> 06:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
we try to deliver every day despite
 
06:37:03.170 --> 06:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
staff reductions I list here the staff
 
06:37:05.628 --> 06:37:05.638 align:start position:0%
reductions 40 41 full-time staff from
 
06:37:08.810 --> 06:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
2010 to 2017. we haven't lost much since
 
06:37:10.970 --> 06:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
then we've been pretty stable
 
06:37:12.230 --> 06:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
um but
 
06:37:14.090 --> 06:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
um with no reduction in work in fact
 
06:37:16.548 --> 06:37:16.558 align:start position:0%
increases in work I think right
 
06:37:16.558 --> 06:37:17.270 align:start position:0%
increases in work I think right
um

06:37:17.270 --> 06:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:20.390 --> 06:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't say that just to Cassie but
 
06:37:22.910 --> 06:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
um but particularly to Cassie
 
06:37:22.920 --> 06:37:23.570 align:start position:0%
um but particularly to Cassie
um

06:37:23.570 --> 06:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:26.208 --> 06:37:26.218 align:start position:0%
so day in and day out we balance the
 
06:37:27.830 --> 06:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
needs that
 
06:37:29.628 --> 06:37:29.638 align:start position:0%
are presented to us every every
 
06:37:31.010 --> 06:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
commissioner every Governor every
 
06:37:33.048 --> 06:37:33.058 align:start position:0%
legislator wants greater speed greater
 
06:37:37.070 --> 06:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility greater operational ability
 
06:37:38.810 --> 06:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
to do their job
 
06:37:40.610 --> 06:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
um but we also have a statutory role as
 
06:37:42.890 --> 06:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
the state's Chief and actually written
 
06:37:44.628 --> 06:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
in statute this way the chase States
 
06:37:46.610 --> 06:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
Chief fiscal and policy control officer
 
06:37:49.788 --> 06:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
I think that that's technically me but
 
06:37:53.448 --> 06:37:53.458 align:start position:0%
it's us as a as a unit and and it's a
 
06:37:56.930 --> 06:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we uh relish and we
 
06:37:59.090 --> 06:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
don't do it by spending a lot more money
 
06:38:01.750 --> 06:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
than you think how do we spend the money
 
06:38:04.910 --> 06:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
so this um this slide is
 
06:38:04.920 --> 06:38:05.868 align:start position:0%
so this um this slide is
um

06:38:05.868 --> 06:38:05.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:08.270 --> 06:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
is occasionally somewhat misleading but
 
06:38:09.410 --> 06:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
I'm going to show it to you and then
 
06:38:11.208 --> 06:38:11.218 align:start position:0%
describe it to you you can divide our
 
06:38:12.948 --> 06:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
budget into three bits and you have to
 
06:38:15.350 --> 06:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
divide our budget into three bits
 
06:38:16.910 --> 06:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I used to say that we are retiree
 
06:38:19.070 --> 06:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
health and everything else we are a
 
06:38:20.628 --> 06:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
department that does a lot of things and
 
06:38:23.708 --> 06:38:23.718 align:start position:0%
we also provide retiree health
 
06:38:27.830 --> 06:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
care to thousands of State retirees that
 
06:38:29.868 --> 06:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
is not an operational thing that is a
 
06:38:31.788 --> 06:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
that is a benefit that is afforded to
 
06:38:35.510 --> 06:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
people and it's called under the law and
 
06:38:37.310 --> 06:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's costs are our
 
06:38:39.530 --> 06:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
um are something that that we have to do
 
06:38:41.990 --> 06:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
so every time I talk about our budget I
 
06:38:44.570 --> 06:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
will describe it that way
 
06:38:44.580 --> 06:38:45.170 align:start position:0%
will describe it that way
um

06:38:45.170 --> 06:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:47.510 --> 06:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
there is a central facilities Bureau
 
06:38:49.128 --> 06:38:49.138 align:start position:0%
which I'm going to describe in a minute
 
06:38:51.410 --> 06:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
which is functionally double counting
 
06:38:53.270 --> 06:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's not an 8 million dollar increase to
 
06:38:55.670 --> 06:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
the budget but it's a it's an internal
 
06:38:58.010 --> 06:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
service allocation formula so I'm going
 
06:38:59.750 --> 06:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
to set that aside and if you look at the
 
06:39:01.788 --> 06:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
everything else part of the budgets um
 
06:39:05.090 --> 06:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
75.1 million to 75.2 million to 75.5
 
06:39:07.930 --> 06:39:07.940 align:start position:0%
million that's not a dramatic increase
 
06:39:11.570 --> 06:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
why do I say that you need to exclude
 
06:39:13.850 --> 06:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
the central facilities charges out of
 
06:39:15.470 --> 06:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
everything else well if you turn to the
 
06:39:18.890 --> 06:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
next slide It's a Wonderful chart on
 
06:39:20.270 --> 06:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
page five
 
06:39:20.280 --> 06:39:21.048 align:start position:0%
page five
um

06:39:21.048 --> 06:39:21.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:23.868 --> 06:39:23.878 align:start position:0%
at least I like it
 
06:39:28.850 --> 06:39:28.860 align:start position:0%
what do we do we are like doit we uh we
 
06:39:30.530 --> 06:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
bill every agency every agency will talk
 
06:39:32.270 --> 06:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
about how much money they're paying if
 
06:39:33.948 --> 06:39:33.958 align:start position:0%
they're in a State Building how much
 
06:39:35.750 --> 06:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
money they transfer transfer to General
 
06:39:37.910 --> 06:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
Services it's listed in in the class
 
06:39:37.920 --> 06:39:38.990 align:start position:0%
Services it's listed in in the class
lines

06:39:38.990 --> 06:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
lines
 
06:39:40.788 --> 06:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
um and they list how they do it and to
 
06:39:42.350 --> 06:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
some extent we tell them what to charge
 
06:39:45.288 --> 06:39:45.298 align:start position:0%
and they charge it in the past we uh we
 
06:39:48.230 --> 06:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
allocated staff rather poorly
 
06:39:50.390 --> 06:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
we took the most expensive guy and
 
06:39:52.070 --> 06:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
charged him I said guy because it was a
 
06:39:53.690 --> 06:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
guy and charged him to the most
 
06:39:55.910 --> 06:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
expensive accounting unit
 
06:39:57.170 --> 06:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
um we are the biggest accounting you
 
06:39:59.030 --> 06:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
know we took the second most highly paid
 
06:40:01.070 --> 06:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
person and charged him to the second
 
06:40:03.470 --> 06:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
biggest accounting unit at some point
 
06:40:07.128 --> 06:40:07.138 align:start position:0%
that's vaguely sort of kind of
 
06:40:09.650 --> 06:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
allocating but not really like the one
 
06:40:11.810 --> 06:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
guy the number two guy was charged him
 
06:40:13.368 --> 06:40:13.378 align:start position:0%
an accounting unit where he he almost
 
06:40:14.990 --> 06:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
literally one year didn't go into that
 
06:40:17.090 --> 06:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
building but we were charging that and
 
06:40:18.230 --> 06:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's just because they didn't do
 
06:40:22.010 --> 06:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
anything uh differently but um
 
06:40:24.110 --> 06:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh we challenged the division of plant
 
06:40:25.430 --> 06:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
and property to come up with a better
 
06:40:27.048 --> 06:40:27.058 align:start position:0%
way of doing it and some of this grew
 
06:40:28.430 --> 06:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
out of one of the governor's challenges
 
06:40:30.048 --> 06:40:30.058 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
06:40:32.570 --> 06:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
um combine some of our facilities
 
06:40:35.208 --> 06:40:35.218 align:start position:0%
bureaus in a way that made sense Court
 
06:40:36.770 --> 06:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
facilities is a big Bureau is still
 
06:40:38.390 --> 06:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
separate because they're they have a
 
06:40:39.410 --> 06:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
governing structure that's different
 
06:40:41.690 --> 06:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
because of Court accreditation and their
 
06:40:43.970 --> 06:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
Court facility is a different branch but
 
06:40:45.948 --> 06:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
um the other facilities are combined we
 
06:40:48.048 --> 06:40:48.058 align:start position:0%
try to centralize facilities expenses
 
06:40:50.208 --> 06:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
and and Karen and Andrea in particular
 
06:40:51.650 --> 06:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time going through our
 
06:40:54.110 --> 06:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
charges and said what's centralized and
 
06:40:56.270 --> 06:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
what's building specific and I'm going
 
06:40:58.670 --> 06:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
to oversimplify think of uh think of a
 
06:41:00.730 --> 06:41:00.740 align:start position:0%
utility bill for a bit for laundry gun
 
06:41:02.990 --> 06:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's clearly a charge that should be
 
06:41:04.310 --> 06:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
assigned to laundry again and only the
 
06:41:06.470 --> 06:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
agencies in laundering
 
06:41:06.480 --> 06:41:07.548 align:start position:0%
agencies in laundering
um

06:41:07.548 --> 06:41:07.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:10.310 --> 06:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
the state's electrician or one of the
 
06:41:12.350 --> 06:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
state's electricians who does work in 20
 
06:41:14.150 --> 06:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
or 30 buildings should not be assigned
 
06:41:15.948 --> 06:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
that way he should be assigned centrally
 
06:41:17.750 --> 06:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
and then Bill and then get billed out
 
06:41:20.150 --> 06:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
build out so we put those Central
 
06:41:21.770 --> 06:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
charges in an accounting unit called
 
06:41:24.650 --> 06:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
Central facilities hence the Box Au
 
06:41:26.830 --> 06:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
Central facilities
 
06:41:30.048 --> 06:41:30.058 align:start position:0%
I use two pretend buildings well they're
 
06:41:31.850 --> 06:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
actually real buildings
 
06:41:33.770 --> 06:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
one is the Spalding building and one
 
06:41:35.750 --> 06:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
other is the m s building which dra is
 
06:41:35.760 --> 06:41:36.470 align:start position:0%
other is the m s building which dra is
and

06:41:36.470 --> 06:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:41:38.750 --> 06:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
and so we allocate costs to those
 
06:41:41.570 --> 06:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
buildings that that accounting unit will
 
06:41:42.948 --> 06:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
reimburse the central facilities
 
06:41:45.230 --> 06:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
accounting and Associate it's an intra
 
06:41:48.288 --> 06:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
agency transfer and it and it's
 
06:41:49.788 --> 06:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
essentially the equivalent of an
 
06:41:52.490 --> 06:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
internal service fund uh to allocate our
 
06:41:55.368 --> 06:41:55.378 align:start position:0%
costs the cost then in the Spalding
 
06:41:57.048 --> 06:41:57.058 align:start position:0%
billing building building accounting
 
06:41:59.208 --> 06:41:59.218 align:start position:0%
unit are the actual Spalding building
 
06:42:02.090 --> 06:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
charges which are in this particular
 
06:42:03.890 --> 06:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
case paid entirely by the Department of
 
06:42:05.930 --> 06:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
Labor we then build a Department of
 
06:42:08.868 --> 06:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
Labor because we Bill actual expenses in
 
06:42:12.530 --> 06:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
this Arena and they then pay us
 
06:42:15.948 --> 06:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
um for those charges on an annual basis
 
06:42:18.350 --> 06:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's how that's done it's a more
 
06:42:22.070 --> 06:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
accurate way of doing things because we
 
06:42:24.530 --> 06:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
will be charging the money that is
 
06:42:27.110 --> 06:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
actually spent and we will be allocating
 
06:42:28.430 --> 06:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
the centralized
 
06:42:31.730 --> 06:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
um expenses correctly instead of you
 
06:42:33.110 --> 06:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
know there used to be a building I won't
 
06:42:34.910 --> 06:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
say which one that looked like it had no
 
06:42:37.010 --> 06:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
work done on it because we didn't assign
 
06:42:39.288 --> 06:42:39.298 align:start position:0%
a staff member to it so it looked like
 
06:42:41.150 --> 06:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
nothing was done there which just simply
 
06:42:42.948 --> 06:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
wasn't true but just the way things sort
 
06:42:45.170 --> 06:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
of worked out this way everybody is
 
06:42:46.970 --> 06:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
paying their allocated share what's
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
actually happening in the business
 
06:42:52.190 --> 06:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
on the other hand though that creates an
 
06:42:54.230 --> 06:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
eight million dollar charge that that is
 
06:42:56.570 --> 06:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
just circling and it's not it's not new
 
06:42:58.910 --> 06:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
money it's allocated money and that's uh
 
06:43:00.770 --> 06:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
functionally double counted so that's
 
06:43:03.048 --> 06:43:03.058 align:start position:0%
why I exclude the 8 million in that so
 
06:43:04.910 --> 06:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
if you turn the page
 
06:43:07.010 --> 06:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
six I almost skipped a page
 
06:43:09.708 --> 06:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
um what's our budget story
 
06:43:11.628 --> 06:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
um if you have the color version you'd
 
06:43:13.970 --> 06:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
notice that all of the who how what are
 
06:43:17.390 --> 06:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
all in blue it's very clever actually
 
06:43:19.670 --> 06:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
um so what's our budget story um you can
 
06:43:21.110 --> 06:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
see it I have our efficiency budget here
 
06:43:24.410 --> 06:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs budget here
 
06:43:25.610 --> 06:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
um I told you what's happening on
 
06:43:27.410 --> 06:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
06:43:29.690 --> 06:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
um uh I list here General funds and
 
06:43:31.910 --> 06:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
other funding so you can see that both
 
06:43:34.250 --> 06:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
for retiree health and for
 
06:43:35.990 --> 06:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
um for the Department's operations
 
06:43:40.548 --> 06:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
itself our uh our cost increase is is uh
 
06:43:42.948 --> 06:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
minimal to say the least on General
 
06:43:45.288 --> 06:43:45.298 align:start position:0%
funds we actually on the operating part
 
06:43:47.930 --> 06:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
of the budget declined 2.3 percent on
 
06:43:49.368 --> 06:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
retiree Health in the first year we
 
06:43:52.430 --> 06:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
declined 6.4 percent
 
06:43:52.440 --> 06:43:53.330 align:start position:0%
declined 6.4 percent
um

06:43:53.330 --> 06:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:57.170 --> 06:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
in the um second year of the of the
 
06:43:59.868 --> 06:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget in 2025
 
06:44:03.350 --> 06:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
um we're still down 0.07 and on retiree
 
06:44:05.030 --> 06:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
Health we're up up three but there's
 
06:44:06.708 --> 06:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
money in prioritized needs and I'm going
 
06:44:08.570 --> 06:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
to get to that retiree Health we
 
06:44:11.090 --> 06:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
budgeted don't exceed three percent
 
06:44:12.650 --> 06:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
and if the costs are greater than that
 
06:44:14.868 --> 06:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
even if you have to pay them stick them
 
06:44:17.030 --> 06:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
in prioritizing so there is a cost in
 
06:44:19.670 --> 06:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs if you turn to page
 
06:44:21.350 --> 06:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
seven you can see how this breaks out
 
06:44:23.448 --> 06:44:23.458 align:start position:0%
across the department
 
06:44:26.150 --> 06:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
um by uh by division
 
06:44:28.128 --> 06:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
and you can see that it's it's fairly
 
06:44:28.138 --> 06:44:29.390 align:start position:0%
and you can see that it's it's fairly
Equitable

06:44:29.390 --> 06:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
Equitable
 
06:44:31.010 --> 06:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
um by division if anybody really wanted
 
06:44:33.410 --> 06:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
to talk about a specific division we
 
06:44:35.090 --> 06:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
could go into detail
 
06:44:37.250 --> 06:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
I suspect nobody really wants to get
 
06:44:39.650 --> 06:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
into that level of detail so I'm going
 
06:44:41.930 --> 06:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
to skip to page eight although plenty of
 
06:44:43.910 --> 06:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
time for that in questions and I'm going
 
06:44:46.190 --> 06:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
to talk about what our prioritized needs
 
06:44:49.010 --> 06:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
are that we talked about before
 
06:44:50.510 --> 06:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
um the biggest one on the top line is
 
06:44:52.730 --> 06:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
retiree health
 
06:44:57.170 --> 06:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm really proud of retiree Health
 
06:44:59.030 --> 06:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and the and the work that's done
 
06:45:01.070 --> 06:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
there and the work that's done in risk
 
06:45:03.288 --> 06:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
and benefits in fact our Deputy
 
06:45:04.490 --> 06:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
Commissioner used to be the director of
 
06:45:06.530 --> 06:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
Riskin benefits but don't tell her I
 
06:45:08.208 --> 06:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
told you that
 
06:45:08.218 --> 06:45:09.890 align:start position:0%
told you that
um

06:45:09.890 --> 06:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:11.948 --> 06:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
it's a very well run
 
06:45:14.530 --> 06:45:14.540 align:start position:0%
division with an I on the bottom line
 
06:45:17.150 --> 06:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
provide tremendous customer service but
 
06:45:20.448 --> 06:45:20.458 align:start position:0%
when I on the bottom line and we pulled
 
06:45:22.730 --> 06:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
a massive rabbit out of our hat a couple
 
06:45:25.090 --> 06:45:25.100 align:start position:0%
years ago by moving toward medicated
 
06:45:28.610 --> 06:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicare Advantage I do that
 
06:45:32.090 --> 06:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
every time Medicare Advantage and
 
06:45:33.650 --> 06:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
dramatically reducing the amount of
 
06:45:35.150 --> 06:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
money estate dollars that were being
 
06:45:37.970 --> 06:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
spent on retiree Health that is not
 
06:45:39.650 --> 06:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
going to keep happening and I've tried
 
06:45:43.010 --> 06:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
to alert lawmakers for the last three or
 
06:45:46.010 --> 06:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
four years that we have no more rabbits
 
06:45:48.470 --> 06:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
and we have no more hats and costs like
 
06:45:50.570 --> 06:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
Health Care are going to go up and
 
06:45:52.610 --> 06:45:52.620 align:start position:0%
health care costs go up this is how much
 
06:45:54.170 --> 06:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
health care costs go up we have some
 
06:45:57.048 --> 06:45:57.058 align:start position:0%
residual from the the savings actual
 
06:45:59.810 --> 06:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
expense on retired Health was 52 million
 
06:46:02.170 --> 06:46:02.180 align:start position:0%
instead of a much higher budgeted number
 
06:46:04.430 --> 06:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
and it's why the adjusted authorization
 
06:46:07.850 --> 06:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 23 is 67.8
 
06:46:09.590 --> 06:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
um we'll probably come in under that for
 
06:46:11.690 --> 06:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
the same reason but we'll be at we'll be
 
06:46:15.110 --> 06:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
at 64 million in fiscal 24.
 
06:46:17.208 --> 06:46:17.218 align:start position:0%
um you know still analysis that comes in
 
06:46:19.788 --> 06:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
and we do a we do a constant reanalysis
 
06:46:22.310 --> 06:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
of that but the cost in the second year
 
06:46:24.468 --> 06:46:24.478 align:start position:0%
are higher than that and total funds
 
06:46:27.048 --> 06:46:27.058 align:start position:0%
it's 75 million and that would require
 
06:46:29.090 --> 06:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
an additional 3.4 million in general
 
06:46:31.850 --> 06:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
funds beyond our efficiency Target
 
06:46:34.250 --> 06:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
um so you have that the other items here
 
06:46:37.490 --> 06:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
we try to put as much of utilities into
 
06:46:37.500 --> 06:46:38.150 align:start position:0%
we try to put as much of utilities into
um

06:46:38.150 --> 06:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:40.070 --> 06:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
into the efficiency budget as we could
 
06:46:41.868 --> 06:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
we did a pretty good job of that but
 
06:46:43.850 --> 06:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
utilities are
 
06:46:47.510 --> 06:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh difficult shall we say this year
 
06:46:49.250 --> 06:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
um you may have noticed that if you um
 
06:46:51.890 --> 06:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
if you have heating oil at home
 
06:46:54.110 --> 06:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
um I certainly did
 
06:46:56.810 --> 06:46:56.820 align:start position:0%
um we have some additional general fund
 
06:46:58.670 --> 06:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
needs for deferred maintenance around
 
06:47:00.590 --> 06:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
and deferred maintenance just means the
 
06:47:02.570 --> 06:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
state has an aging physical plant and we
 
06:47:04.310 --> 06:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
don't do a great job we do a great job
 
06:47:06.650 --> 06:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
keeping up with it as best we can but
 
06:47:09.948 --> 06:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
it's aging and uh
 
06:47:11.930 --> 06:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a request for 2.5
 
06:47:13.788 --> 06:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
million in the first year and a little
 
06:47:15.708 --> 06:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
less than that in the second year you
 
06:47:17.570 --> 06:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
give me 10 times that amount of money I
 
06:47:19.368 --> 06:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
would be able to spend
 
06:47:21.830 --> 06:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
10 times that our deferred maintenance
 
06:47:23.690 --> 06:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
list is hundreds of millions of dollars
 
06:47:26.150 --> 06:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
and that's only because
 
06:47:28.190 --> 06:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
we don't make it complete
 
06:47:30.048 --> 06:47:30.058 align:start position:0%
because it's just you know you've been
 
06:47:31.128 --> 06:47:31.138 align:start position:0%
in some of the buildings and say
 
06:47:33.110 --> 06:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
government and um
 
06:47:35.510 --> 06:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
some of them some of them the dra
 
06:47:37.730 --> 06:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
building for example is quite nice
 
06:47:41.570 --> 06:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
um some of them are less uh pristine
 
06:47:42.890 --> 06:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
than that if you go in the main building
 
06:47:45.650 --> 06:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
on the State House campus and we're
 
06:47:47.990 --> 06:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
doing the best we can there are a
 
06:47:51.468 --> 06:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
handful of position requests
 
06:47:55.490 --> 06:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
um in our budget and um
 
06:47:57.708 --> 06:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple worth highlighting
 
06:47:59.930 --> 06:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
one is the the general fund requests
 
06:48:02.390 --> 06:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
that are one is um an accounting
 
06:48:04.788 --> 06:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
position that is essentially for federal
 
06:48:06.650 --> 06:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
reporting there's some discussion about
 
06:48:08.330 --> 06:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
federal reporting being done to go for
 
06:48:10.250 --> 06:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
federal reporting being done at
 
06:48:12.048 --> 06:48:12.058 align:start position:0%
administrative Services because we do
 
06:48:14.270 --> 06:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
the federal reporting
 
06:48:16.190 --> 06:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
um and it will be have to be done over
 
06:48:17.868 --> 06:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
time all of the ARP and all of that
 
06:48:19.910 --> 06:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
money will roll out over many many years
 
06:48:23.868 --> 06:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
and um that um that is the biggest
 
06:48:26.270 --> 06:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
general fund portion of that request the
 
06:48:29.090 --> 06:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
second biggest on our list is uh is an
 
06:48:31.250 --> 06:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
HR position we have a very large
 
06:48:34.368 --> 06:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
complicated agency with 450 positions
 
06:48:36.650 --> 06:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
many of them are part-time and one of
 
06:48:39.230 --> 06:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
the smallest HR staffs in the uh in the
 
06:48:39.240 --> 06:48:40.208 align:start position:0%
the smallest HR staffs in the uh in the
state

06:48:40.208 --> 06:48:40.218 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:48:42.170 --> 06:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
administratively attached agencies and
 
06:48:45.230 --> 06:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
whatnot and um it is a it is a critical
 
06:48:47.570 --> 06:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
position in addition to that
 
06:48:47.580 --> 06:48:48.288 align:start position:0%
position in addition to that
um

06:48:48.288 --> 06:48:48.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:50.628 --> 06:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
we've looked at redoing some of the
 
06:48:52.190 --> 06:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance positions to create some
 
06:48:54.770 --> 06:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
full-time positions our vacancy rate is
 
06:48:57.890 --> 06:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
about is about 18 and
 
06:48:57.900 --> 06:48:58.670 align:start position:0%
about is about 18 and
um

06:48:58.670 --> 06:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:02.868 --> 06:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
among full-time positions it's about 18
 
06:49:04.128 --> 06:49:04.138 align:start position:0%
um it goes up and down a little bit
 
06:49:05.868 --> 06:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
we've actually hired more than 100
 
06:49:08.330 --> 06:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
people over the last 12 months maybe a
 
06:49:09.530 --> 06:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
hundred and
 
06:49:12.110 --> 06:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
115 118 I haven't looked at the numbers
 
06:49:15.110 --> 06:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
that recently but at least 10 a month
 
06:49:17.390 --> 06:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
um but we lose a lot of people too we're
 
06:49:20.750 --> 06:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
up net a handful of positions but like a
 
06:49:22.190 --> 06:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
lot of places we're just we're trying to
 
06:49:23.690 --> 06:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
keep up with that but there's a lot of a
 
06:49:26.810 --> 06:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
lot of churn that goes into that and um
 
06:49:28.788 --> 06:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
and you know we have a small HR staff
 
06:49:30.170 --> 06:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
and a small payroll staff and we're
 
06:49:31.610 --> 06:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
trying to keep up so that's one of those
 
06:49:34.310 --> 06:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
positions uh doit transfers is something
 
06:49:36.350 --> 06:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
everybody has in in their prioritized
 
06:49:39.230 --> 06:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
needs but um those are just some things
 
06:49:41.270 --> 06:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
I wanted to I want to talk to you about
 
06:49:43.368 --> 06:49:43.378 align:start position:0%
more generally
 
06:49:45.110 --> 06:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
there are a handful of things I want to
 
06:49:47.090 --> 06:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
highlight though on page nine where do
 
06:49:48.770 --> 06:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
we go from here
 
06:49:48.780 --> 06:49:50.510 align:start position:0%
we go from here
um

06:49:50.510 --> 06:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:52.548 --> 06:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
there could be 20 things on this list
 
06:49:55.730 --> 06:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
and and I struggle to make it fit on a
 
06:49:55.740 --> 06:49:57.110 align:start position:0%
and and I struggle to make it fit on a
page

06:49:57.110 --> 06:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
page
 
06:49:59.090 --> 06:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
um particularly when Sherry did that the
 
06:50:01.310 --> 06:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
weird V on the side that that lost me a
 
06:50:03.048 --> 06:50:03.058 align:start position:0%
little bit of space
 
06:50:05.628 --> 06:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
um one is the cloud people need to be
 
06:50:07.910 --> 06:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
aware of that that that that's happening
 
06:50:10.490 --> 06:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
the state's uh the state's enterprise
 
06:50:12.530 --> 06:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
system is going to go to the cloud it
 
06:50:14.930 --> 06:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
can't not we can't not update whether
 
06:50:16.490 --> 06:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
it's with the existing vendor or new
 
06:50:18.590 --> 06:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
vendor um it's going to be expect an
 
06:50:19.910 --> 06:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
expensive Enterprise that is going to
 
06:50:22.310 --> 06:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
have an impact on every Department
 
06:50:24.830 --> 06:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh the only real alternative is
 
06:50:26.868 --> 06:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
stagnation which isn't really an
 
06:50:28.690 --> 06:50:28.700 align:start position:0%
alternative that's why I mentioned it
 
06:50:30.830 --> 06:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
procurement standardization is something
 
06:50:32.628 --> 06:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
we take for granted I know the governor
 
06:50:35.330 --> 06:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
has a strong interest in in the notion
 
06:50:37.250 --> 06:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
of people you know and stop shopping if
 
06:50:39.708 --> 06:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
you want to sell tea cups to the state
 
06:50:41.090 --> 06:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
for example
 
06:50:42.048 --> 06:50:42.058 align:start position:0%
um you would need to be able to go to
 
06:50:44.330 --> 06:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
one website and figure out how can I bid
 
06:50:46.610 --> 06:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
on the teacup business or the tea cozy
 
06:50:49.610 --> 06:50:49.620 align:start position:0%
business or the tea pot business I want
 
06:50:51.468 --> 06:50:51.478 align:start position:0%
to I want a shot at that and for every
 
06:50:53.510 --> 06:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
agency not just the Statewide contracts
 
06:50:56.810 --> 06:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
and uh we're working jointly with dyt on
 
06:50:58.910 --> 06:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
that but in addition to that the the
 
06:51:02.030 --> 06:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
States state procurement committee
 
06:51:02.040 --> 06:51:02.690 align:start position:0%
States state procurement committee
um

06:51:02.690 --> 06:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:04.430 --> 06:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
which Senator Carson has played a big
 
06:51:06.650 --> 06:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
role in for about a decade
 
06:51:09.590 --> 06:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
um but uh and goes back to the 2015-16
 
06:51:11.448 --> 06:51:11.458 align:start position:0%
changes that created
 
06:51:14.090 --> 06:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
um 21g and the rules there but
 
06:51:15.590 --> 06:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that they've pushed
 
06:51:18.770 --> 06:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
us on dramatically is standardized
 
06:51:20.390 --> 06:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
procedures so departments aren't doing
 
06:51:21.590 --> 06:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
things differently
 
06:51:24.530 --> 06:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh best practice
 
06:51:26.810 --> 06:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
um and uh and better reporting better
 
06:51:29.628 --> 06:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
reporting in what we do a component of
 
06:51:32.208 --> 06:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
that software upgrades will get us there
 
06:51:34.190 --> 06:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
but there'll be a lot of little projects
 
06:51:36.890 --> 06:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
that get there but procurement
 
06:51:38.990 --> 06:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
um doing a better job on procurement and
 
06:51:41.350 --> 06:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
taking into account
 
06:51:43.430 --> 06:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
not just the needs of the agency
 
06:51:45.468 --> 06:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
procuring but the needs of the people
 
06:51:47.090 --> 06:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
doing business with the state and
 
06:51:49.548 --> 06:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
wanting to do business with the state is
 
06:51:51.170 --> 06:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
uh is going to inform a lot of things we
 
06:51:51.180 --> 06:51:52.010 align:start position:0%
uh is going to inform a lot of things we
do

06:51:52.010 --> 06:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:51:53.930 --> 06:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about strategic facility
 
06:51:53.940 --> 06:51:55.310 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about strategic facility
management

06:51:55.310 --> 06:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
management
 
06:51:57.350 --> 06:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and and I put in parenthesis here 90
 
06:51:57.360 --> 06:51:58.730 align:start position:0%
um and and I put in parenthesis here 90
buildings

06:51:58.730 --> 06:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
06:52:00.468 --> 06:52:00.478 align:start position:0%
um somebody mentioned to me that it
 
06:52:01.910 --> 06:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea to kind of refresh
 
06:52:03.230 --> 06:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
people's memory that there are a lot of
 
06:52:04.548 --> 06:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
buildings this we're not talking about a
 
06:52:06.468 --> 06:52:06.478 align:start position:0%
physical plant we're talking about the
 
06:52:08.990 --> 06:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
state's ailing physical plant
 
06:52:10.910 --> 06:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
I mentioned the main building and I
 
06:52:12.230 --> 06:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't say that the market or laundry
 
06:52:14.990 --> 06:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
going to say that to Market but there
 
06:52:16.330 --> 06:52:16.340 align:start position:0%
are buildings that need a lot of work
 
06:52:19.670 --> 06:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
and you walk around the bill I had a
 
06:52:21.170 --> 06:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
meeting we have a lot of meetings in
 
06:52:24.110 --> 06:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
room five in the annex which is a lovely
 
06:52:26.448 --> 06:52:26.458 align:start position:0%
place but you forget
 
06:52:28.730 --> 06:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a lot of meetings
 
06:52:31.368 --> 06:52:31.378 align:start position:0%
there that it's awkward and so every
 
06:52:32.270 --> 06:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
time we have a meeting with somebody
 
06:52:33.830 --> 06:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
from out of state they spend the whole
 
06:52:35.628 --> 06:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
or out of the state government they
 
06:52:37.310 --> 06:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
spend the whole time like staring at the
 
06:52:38.990 --> 06:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
ceiling and looking around at the pipes
 
06:52:41.930 --> 06:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
in the 1970 paneling in the wall and the
 
06:52:43.430 --> 06:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
green pipes that are exposed and
 
06:52:46.368 --> 06:52:46.378 align:start position:0%
thinking where am I I actually had a
 
06:52:48.110 --> 06:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
State Rep who said to me hey you know
 
06:52:50.150 --> 06:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
what in the capital budget next year why
 
06:52:51.410 --> 06:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
don't you make sure you've got some
 
06:52:53.930 --> 06:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
money in it we shouldn't be bringing
 
06:52:56.090 --> 06:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
people into a room like this and I
 
06:52:58.310 --> 06:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
always think why we're in here every day
 
06:53:00.590 --> 06:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
and we work here and and it's not good
 
06:53:03.350 --> 06:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
enough for people to come in from to if
 
06:53:04.548 --> 06:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
it's good enough for people to work here
 
06:53:06.288 --> 06:53:06.298 align:start position:0%
it's good enough for everybody else on
 
06:53:07.670 --> 06:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
the other hand it really does need a
 
06:53:09.350 --> 06:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
little bit of work and a lot of the
 
06:53:11.570 --> 06:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
buildings like that we need to do a
 
06:53:13.730 --> 06:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
better job figuring that out the central
 
06:53:15.590 --> 06:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
facilities Bureau is a step in that
 
06:53:17.990 --> 06:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
direction in modernizing our operation
 
06:53:20.030 --> 06:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's something Karen thinks about every
 
06:53:20.040 --> 06:53:20.830 align:start position:0%
it's something Karen thinks about every
day

06:53:20.830 --> 06:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:53:23.030 --> 06:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
oh yeah she's there
 
06:53:25.730 --> 06:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
um raise your hand oh there you go
 
06:53:25.740 --> 06:53:26.390 align:start position:0%
um raise your hand oh there you go
um

06:53:26.390 --> 06:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:28.788 --> 06:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
thinks about every day we need to do
 
06:53:30.708 --> 06:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
better long-range planning in particular
 
06:53:32.868 --> 06:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
for the greater Concord campuses if you
 
06:53:34.788 --> 06:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
think about our buildings it's a Sops
 
06:53:36.288 --> 06:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
campus the old hospital campus there's
 
06:53:39.170 --> 06:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
the downtown area there's the Hazen
 
06:53:41.150 --> 06:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
Drive bit and the Smoky Bear Boulevard
 
06:53:43.670 --> 06:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
bed and we need to do a better job
 
06:53:46.310 --> 06:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
planning and we're working on on
 
06:53:48.350 --> 06:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
efficiencies within our operation but
 
06:53:49.670 --> 06:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's something the governor has been
 
06:53:52.968 --> 06:53:52.978 align:start position:0%
supportive of from uh from before he was
 
06:53:56.090 --> 06:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
sworn in about the notion that there are
 
06:53:57.530 --> 06:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
significant deferred maintenance needs
 
06:54:00.350 --> 06:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
of the state we need to be there
 
06:54:02.330 --> 06:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
human resource support unit human Human
 
06:54:04.850 --> 06:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
Resources is an issue with every bit of
 
06:54:07.310 --> 06:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
state government not just doing payroll
 
06:54:09.230 --> 06:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
correctly that's a really big thing
 
06:54:11.270 --> 06:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
though doing payroll correctly and we
 
06:54:12.708 --> 06:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
need to do a better job doing payroll
 
06:54:14.510 --> 06:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
correctly and not having to fix
 
06:54:17.330 --> 06:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
everything all the time but some
 
06:54:19.250 --> 06:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
agencies are quite large we've met with
 
06:54:21.288 --> 06:54:21.298 align:start position:0%
some of them today we're quite large and
 
06:54:23.090 --> 06:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
have a much larger staff than others
 
06:54:25.670 --> 06:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
some are quite small and we're going to
 
06:54:28.430 --> 06:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
talk to some of them in a few minutes
 
06:54:30.350 --> 06:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
um and you know if you have 3 000
 
06:54:32.448 --> 06:54:32.458 align:start position:0%
employees you probably have a slightly
 
06:54:35.448 --> 06:54:35.458 align:start position:0%
larger HR operation than
 
06:54:37.670 --> 06:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
um than say we met with Department of
 
06:54:40.430 --> 06:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
Agriculture earlier with 40 people they
 
06:54:41.990 --> 06:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
know I'm an HR person they don't have a
 
06:54:44.390 --> 06:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
CFO there are a lot of things they they
 
06:54:46.670 --> 06:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
can't do which means there's a different
 
06:54:49.610 --> 06:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
level of service knowledge expertise Etc
 
06:54:54.110 --> 06:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
we created an HR RSU to answer the
 
06:54:55.968 --> 06:54:55.978 align:start position:0%
question centralized or decentralized by
 
06:54:58.368 --> 06:54:58.378 align:start position:0%
saying both big agencies do a good job
 
06:55:00.830 --> 06:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
without having to pull people away from
 
06:55:02.750 --> 06:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
them and take everybody and ship them
 
06:55:04.490 --> 06:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
off somewhere but small agencies can't
 
06:55:06.708 --> 06:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
and we want to build safety in numbers
 
06:55:09.650 --> 06:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
and and create that and we work very
 
06:55:12.310 --> 06:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
hard by combining
 
06:55:15.770 --> 06:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
resources to create to create critical
 
06:55:17.510 --> 06:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
mass and provide better service for
 
06:55:19.968 --> 06:55:19.978 align:start position:0%
people we're doing that in the HR SEO we
 
06:55:22.548 --> 06:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
want to keep doing it more directly in
 
06:55:25.548 --> 06:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
that and um and we probably want to do
 
06:55:28.030 --> 06:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
more with payroll along those lines
 
06:55:31.190 --> 06:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
mostly though I want to say to you that
 
06:55:34.490 --> 06:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
everything we service every agency and I
 
06:55:36.948 --> 06:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
said before I'm very proud of that it's
 
06:55:40.968 --> 06:55:40.978 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:44.390 --> 06:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
everything every other agency do ends up
 
06:55:46.670 --> 06:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
affecting us you go to discussion with
 
06:55:50.990 --> 06:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
Justice about rent payments
 
06:55:53.090 --> 06:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
um guess who takes care of the facility
 
06:55:55.730 --> 06:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
gets who signed the lease for example we
 
06:55:56.990 --> 06:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
sign the lease we take care of the
 
06:55:58.430 --> 06:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
facility we're going to manage that
 
06:55:58.440 --> 06:55:59.930 align:start position:0%
facility we're going to manage that
facility

06:55:59.930 --> 06:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:56:02.150 --> 06:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
um we might need a position to help
 
06:56:04.250 --> 06:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
manage that facility if we buy the
 
06:56:06.110 --> 06:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
Granite State College building for
 
06:56:08.330 --> 06:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
example the Department of Education is
 
06:56:09.730 --> 06:56:09.740 align:start position:0%
not going to put
 
06:56:11.990 --> 06:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
Facilities Management people in its
 
06:56:14.350 --> 06:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
budget at least they're not supposed to
 
06:56:16.788 --> 06:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
but they're uh
 
06:56:18.590 --> 06:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
um and we would manage that if somebody
 
06:56:21.230 --> 06:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
builds a new computer system liquor has
 
06:56:22.548 --> 06:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
been and it's been for a few years
 
06:56:25.448 --> 06:56:25.458 align:start position:0%
building a giant new computer system and
 
06:56:28.548 --> 06:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
I think I uh I think we have as many
 
06:56:30.410 --> 06:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
admin services staff hours on that
 
06:56:31.910 --> 06:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
project as our liquor of sapphire
 
06:56:34.250 --> 06:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
Arizona project and and so what happens
 
06:56:36.048 --> 06:56:36.058 align:start position:0%
is everybody's priorities suddenly
 
06:56:38.330 --> 06:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
become ours and upend our business and I
 
06:56:39.890 --> 06:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
would just ask you as you go through the
 
06:56:41.270 --> 06:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
budget hearings and budget discussions
 
06:56:43.010 --> 06:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
on an ongoing basis
 
06:56:45.170 --> 06:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
remember that and it's not that it's not
 
06:56:46.490 --> 06:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
that we're opposed to that it's not that
 
06:56:48.048 --> 06:56:48.058 align:start position:0%
we mind that
 
06:56:49.730 --> 06:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
um we we relish it and that's what we're
 
06:56:51.708 --> 06:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
here for but but we we would like to
 
06:56:53.810 --> 06:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
know and you know I'm thinking of a
 
06:56:56.150 --> 06:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
project two years ago where it made it
 
06:56:57.530 --> 06:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
all the way through the budget and then
 
06:56:58.850 --> 06:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
somebody called me up and said by the
 
06:57:01.250 --> 06:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
way you understand that that
 
06:57:02.690 --> 06:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
um they're giving that to you to
 
06:57:05.750 --> 06:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
administer and it and it took um it
 
06:57:08.150 --> 06:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter which project right now
 
06:57:10.548 --> 06:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
um but it could have a p and an F in it
 
06:57:14.208 --> 06:57:14.218 align:start position:0%
but it um but it took an enormous amount
 
06:57:15.708 --> 06:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
of time away from people who were
 
06:57:17.810 --> 06:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
already fully committed and if we're
 
06:57:19.310 --> 06:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
going to plan ahead for things like that
 
06:57:20.990 --> 06:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to plan ahead for
 
06:57:23.230 --> 06:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
things like that with that
 
06:57:26.930 --> 06:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
anybody there ask a question
 
06:57:31.070 --> 06:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
please thanks gets going on uh yeah just
 
06:57:33.830 --> 06:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
a high level question uh many many
 
06:57:35.208 --> 06:57:35.218 align:start position:0%
questions which we'll can deal with
 
06:57:38.030 --> 06:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
offline but the um
 
06:57:40.730 --> 06:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
the assumptions that you use to to make
 
06:57:42.410 --> 06:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
the budget now you as you said you're
 
06:57:44.868 --> 06:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
responsible for purchasing procuring
 
06:57:46.788 --> 06:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
real estate your other State's real
 
06:57:49.128 --> 06:57:49.138 align:start position:0%
estate or the landlord basically you
 
06:57:51.310 --> 06:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
provide heat air conditioning other fuel
 
06:57:55.128 --> 06:57:55.138 align:start position:0%
uh you pay and provide Health Care all
 
06:57:56.628 --> 06:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
at a time when we have record-setting
 
06:57:58.850 --> 06:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
inflation real estate prices have gone
 
06:58:01.368 --> 06:58:01.378 align:start position:0%
through the roof uh we've had record
 
06:58:05.570 --> 06:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
fuel costs and income uh in the state
 
06:58:07.128 --> 06:58:07.138 align:start position:0%
that you're competing against is
 
06:58:07.138 --> 06:58:08.948 align:start position:0%
that you're competing against is
skyrocketing

06:58:08.948 --> 06:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing
 
06:58:12.770 --> 06:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
what assumptions did you put into what
 
06:58:14.390 --> 06:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
those prices
 
06:58:18.288 --> 06:58:18.298 align:start position:0%
of goods and services real estate uh
 
06:58:20.628 --> 06:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
fuel into the budget are you
 
06:58:22.070 --> 06:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
without giving I don't need specific
 
06:58:23.448 --> 06:58:23.458 align:start position:0%
numbers now but are you saying things
 
06:58:25.310 --> 06:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
might get better things are going to say
 
06:58:26.570 --> 06:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
the same are you planning things getting
 
06:58:29.530 --> 06:58:29.540 align:start position:0%
worse I think the assumptions we use are
 
06:58:32.390 --> 06:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
relatively conservative we we you know
 
06:58:33.890 --> 06:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
over the years as a balancing act right
 
06:58:36.230 --> 06:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
I don't use Healthcare as an example
 
06:58:36.240 --> 06:58:37.368 align:start position:0%
I don't use Healthcare as an example
um

06:58:37.368 --> 06:58:37.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:38.868 --> 06:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
if you don't budget enough money for
 
06:58:40.548 --> 06:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
health care it's a catastrophe and we
 
06:58:42.708 --> 06:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
people remember 15 and 16 there were
 
06:58:44.270 --> 06:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
sort of huge issues around retiree
 
06:58:46.430 --> 06:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
health if you budget too much money for
 
06:58:48.410 --> 06:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
healthcare everyone's mad at you because
 
06:58:50.150 --> 06:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
you have budgeted money that could have
 
06:58:52.430 --> 06:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
been used for something else and so over
 
06:58:53.810 --> 06:58:53.820 align:start position:0%
the years we've done a significant
 
06:58:56.030 --> 06:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
amount of refining and you know Cassie
 
06:58:57.708 --> 06:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
can talk to you about um we'll talk to
 
06:58:59.570 --> 06:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about about seagull
 
06:59:01.430 --> 06:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
and and some of the how we sort of
 
06:59:03.468 --> 06:59:03.478 align:start position:0%
refined what we do on and let's use
 
06:59:06.350 --> 06:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
Healthcare as an example
 
06:59:08.510 --> 06:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
came with the same Healthcare consult
 
06:59:09.830 --> 06:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
firm for about
 
06:59:12.410 --> 06:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
since we became
 
06:59:16.310 --> 06:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
care and we we
 
06:59:19.610 --> 06:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
um every cycle do budget working rates
 
06:59:22.910 --> 06:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
we start in April before the budget year
 
06:59:25.968 --> 06:59:25.978 align:start position:0%
and then we refine those numbers later
 
06:59:28.010 --> 06:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
in the year based on what's our
 
06:59:30.530 --> 06:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
experience well how how's our enrollment
 
06:59:33.650 --> 06:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
going and our experience is made up of
 
06:59:36.170 --> 06:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
who goes to the doctor who goes in the
 
06:59:38.150 --> 06:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
hospital how many readmissions those
 
06:59:41.570 --> 06:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
kinds of things but also what's going on
 
06:59:43.368 --> 06:59:43.378 align:start position:0%
in health care and what what are the
 
06:59:46.128 --> 06:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
inflationary factors so we're constantly
 
06:59:48.410 --> 06:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
revisiting the numbers to try and refine
 
06:59:51.048 --> 06:59:51.058 align:start position:0%
them and since I've been working in the
 
06:59:52.990 --> 06:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
department which is about 10 years now
 
06:59:56.930 --> 06:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
we have worked really hard to
 
06:59:59.510 --> 06:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
um to not build in as much cushion to
 
07:00:01.490 --> 07:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
address what Charlie was saying which is
 
07:00:04.070 --> 07:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
that you need enough to to take into
 
07:00:05.930 --> 07:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
account growth and health care costs but
 
07:00:08.270 --> 07:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
when you have budget too much it hurts
 
07:00:10.190 --> 07:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
other programs and people in state
 
07:00:12.890 --> 07:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
government so we work with our
 
07:00:14.628 --> 07:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
Healthcare consultant all the time to
 
07:00:17.330 --> 07:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
revisit the numbers and to revise them
 
07:00:20.448 --> 07:00:20.458 align:start position:0%
so that they come in as sound as they
 
07:00:21.830 --> 07:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
can be and we've been very very
 
07:00:21.840 --> 07:00:23.390 align:start position:0%
can be and we've been very very
successful

07:00:23.390 --> 07:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
successful
 
07:00:26.030 --> 07:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
I think along those lines it's it's I
 
07:00:28.310 --> 07:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
mean it's a good question so on you know
 
07:00:30.048 --> 07:00:30.058 align:start position:0%
pick an area you know our utilities
 
07:00:30.058 --> 07:00:31.128 align:start position:0%
pick an area you know our utilities
numbers

07:00:31.128 --> 07:00:31.138 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
07:00:34.070 --> 07:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
um uh Karen and Donnie Perrin will have
 
07:00:35.930 --> 07:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
sat down you know both having been a
 
07:00:38.750 --> 07:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
former energy managers uh and kind of go
 
07:00:40.128 --> 07:00:40.138 align:start position:0%
over what's happening in the market what
 
07:00:41.448 --> 07:00:41.458 align:start position:0%
do we want to look at in budget and what
 
07:00:42.530 --> 07:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
are we doing in electric what are we
 
07:00:44.448 --> 07:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
doing on gas what are we doing on the
 
07:00:47.208 --> 07:00:47.218 align:start position:0%
various components of it and and try to
 
07:00:47.218 --> 07:00:48.590 align:start position:0%
various components of it and and try to
predict

07:00:48.590 --> 07:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
predict
 
07:00:50.628 --> 07:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
can we predict so we did a really bad
 
07:00:52.430 --> 07:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
job two years ago predicting right
 
07:00:52.440 --> 07:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
job two years ago predicting right
because

07:00:53.510 --> 07:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:00:54.770 --> 07:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
um if you thought inflation was going to
 
07:00:56.270 --> 07:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
be eight and a half percent
 
07:00:58.250 --> 07:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
um good for you
 
07:01:00.230 --> 07:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
um but I didn't
 
07:01:02.448 --> 07:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
um and right now you know what are we
 
07:01:04.850 --> 07:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
guessing you know uh Gary lunetta and
 
07:01:06.288 --> 07:01:06.298 align:start position:0%
procurement is doing supply chain
 
07:01:08.690 --> 07:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
analysis um based on industry numbers
 
07:01:12.830 --> 07:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
every month and guessing but
 
07:01:15.048 --> 07:01:15.058 align:start position:0%
you know we had a salt contract where we
 
07:01:16.910 --> 07:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
saved 36 percent we were all proud of
 
07:01:19.250 --> 07:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
ourselves and the next year went up five
 
07:01:21.590 --> 07:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
um because and and by the way
 
07:01:24.650 --> 07:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
um we did an equally good job then we
 
07:01:27.288 --> 07:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
got a good price it just went up I think
 
07:01:29.868 --> 07:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
that what we're thinking broadly is that
 
07:01:32.930 --> 07:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
inflation is leveling off but nobody
 
07:01:35.990 --> 07:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
dare think it's ending and
 
07:01:36.000 --> 07:01:37.430 align:start position:0%
dare think it's ending and
um

07:01:37.430 --> 07:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:39.350 --> 07:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
like from a price standpoint I heard the
 
07:01:41.510 --> 07:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
governor talking about a recession and
 
07:01:43.490 --> 07:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
possible recession this this morning and
 
07:01:44.570 --> 07:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
I thought
 
07:01:46.910 --> 07:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
in my head this is terrible right I'm
 
07:01:47.990 --> 07:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
thinking what's it going to do the
 
07:01:49.730 --> 07:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
prices it's not going to help them hurt
 
07:01:52.190 --> 07:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure anymore and what's it
 
07:01:54.110 --> 07:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to do for recruiting in terms of
 
07:01:56.690 --> 07:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
jobs and I and it's sort of where we are
 
07:01:56.700 --> 07:01:58.670 align:start position:0%
jobs and I and it's sort of where we are
operationally

07:01:58.670 --> 07:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
operationally
 
07:02:01.310 --> 07:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay great sure this is probably a
 
07:02:02.930 --> 07:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
combination of a more of a comment than
 
07:02:04.968 --> 07:02:04.978 align:start position:0%
a question but um Department of
 
07:02:06.170 --> 07:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
Corrections when they did their
 
07:02:08.570 --> 07:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
presentation how to comment or proposal
 
07:02:10.610 --> 07:02:10.620 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 2 from for their
 
07:02:12.170 --> 07:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
utilities asking for it to be
 
07:02:14.150 --> 07:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing between the biennium and
 
07:02:14.160 --> 07:02:15.288 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing between the biennium and
then

07:02:15.288 --> 07:02:15.298 align:start position:0%
then
 
07:02:17.570 --> 07:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
um if it fell short to have
 
07:02:19.128 --> 07:02:19.138 align:start position:0%
um money appropriated from funds not
 
07:02:21.048 --> 07:02:21.058 align:start position:0%
always appropriated and I just wanted to
 
07:02:22.310 --> 07:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
add that in the department of
 
07:02:23.868 --> 07:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
administrative Services budget they have
 
07:02:25.490 --> 07:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
that same language that's usually built
 
07:02:28.368 --> 07:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
in every year on utilities so I just in
 
07:02:29.930 --> 07:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
case those that didn't know
 
07:02:31.670 --> 07:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
um what correction was proposing is
 
07:02:32.868 --> 07:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
something that administrative Services
 
07:02:36.048 --> 07:02:36.058 align:start position:0%
already has in their budget and I think
 
07:02:37.910 --> 07:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
it was probably safe to say is that in
 
07:02:40.190 --> 07:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the efficiency budget
 
07:02:42.770 --> 07:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
um it was up to the targeted three
 
07:02:44.868 --> 07:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
percent and the prioritized needs is
 
07:02:46.670 --> 07:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
what brought it to a more
 
07:02:48.650 --> 07:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
estimated number
 
07:02:51.590 --> 07:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
um I look over to Karen all of that and
 
07:02:51.600 --> 07:02:55.010 align:start position:0%
um I look over to Karen all of that and
some

07:02:55.010 --> 07:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:57.530 --> 07:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much commissioner
 
07:03:00.530 --> 07:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I think I don't get
 
07:03:01.430 --> 07:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
07:03:08.628 --> 07:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:10.310 --> 07:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
like to invite the advocate for special
 
07:03:10.320 --> 07:03:11.750 align:start position:0%
like to invite the advocate for special
education

07:03:11.750 --> 07:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
07:03:11.760 --> 07:03:16.310 align:start position:0%
education
hi

07:03:16.310 --> 07:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:19.788 --> 07:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
I believe the record uh my name is
 
07:03:21.530 --> 07:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
Charlie arlinghaus the advocate for
 
07:03:23.030 --> 07:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
special education who has not been
 
07:03:25.010 --> 07:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
selected yet is administratively
 
07:03:26.330 --> 07:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of
 
07:03:28.910 --> 07:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
07:03:28.920 --> 07:03:30.110 align:start position:0%
administrative services
um

07:03:30.110 --> 07:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:31.670 --> 07:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
I was going to say I know a little bit
 
07:03:34.430 --> 07:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
about special education but um I don't
 
07:03:35.690 --> 07:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
want to go there
 
07:03:37.330 --> 07:03:37.340 align:start position:0%
um there's a placeholder in the budget
 
07:03:40.610 --> 07:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
for you like I said the position has not
 
07:03:43.128 --> 07:03:43.138 align:start position:0%
been filled yet my understanding is it's
 
07:03:44.930 --> 07:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
likely I'm not involved in the filling
 
07:03:46.850 --> 07:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
of it but that's likely to happen in the
 
07:03:48.830 --> 07:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
next month or two what would happen is
 
07:03:51.650 --> 07:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
we would then work with the new Advocate
 
07:03:53.448 --> 07:03:53.458 align:start position:0%
to fill
 
07:03:55.788 --> 07:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
um to fill positions the budget if you
 
07:03:58.610 --> 07:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
look at it is actually modeled to an
 
07:04:01.910 --> 07:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
extent on I don't oversell this but to
 
07:04:03.770 --> 07:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
an extent on the on the child advocate
 
07:04:06.170 --> 07:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
but at a smaller number
 
07:04:08.330 --> 07:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
um and it is the it's the amount of
 
07:04:10.510 --> 07:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
money essentially in the appropriation
 
07:04:14.930 --> 07:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
and it's uh uh the I think the vision of
 
07:04:17.750 --> 07:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
it is uh two to four people
 
07:04:19.610 --> 07:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and and in the first year or two
 
07:04:21.350 --> 07:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
they're gonna figure out their path as
 
07:04:23.868 --> 07:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:26.270 --> 07:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
that was easy thank you
 
07:04:40.190 --> 07:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:42.948 --> 07:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
conservation land stewardship program
 
07:05:16.750 --> 07:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:19.430 --> 07:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
we might be a Nook or a cranny I'm not
 
07:05:22.548 --> 07:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
sure this is the first time CLS is going
 
07:05:25.310 --> 07:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
through the biennial budget process that
 
07:05:27.410 --> 07:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
said CLS continues to do what it has
 
07:05:29.270 --> 07:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
done for its nearly three decades of
 
07:05:32.208 --> 07:05:32.218 align:start position:0%
existence with little change
 
07:05:35.030 --> 07:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
in short the CLS mission is to protect
 
07:05:36.770 --> 07:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
the state's interests and conservation
 
07:05:39.770 --> 07:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
Investments it is made the majority of
 
07:05:41.690 --> 07:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
land conservation projects occurred
 
07:05:43.670 --> 07:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
through the land conservation investment
 
07:05:48.110 --> 07:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
program lcip that ran between 1987 and
 
07:05:48.120 --> 07:05:49.788 align:start position:0%
program lcip that ran between 1987 and
1993.

07:05:49.788 --> 07:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
1993.
 
07:05:52.430 --> 07:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
after this acquisition phase ended the
 
07:05:54.830 --> 07:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
first iteration of CLS was set up and
 
07:05:57.288 --> 07:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
staffed in 1994.
 
07:05:59.750 --> 07:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
the lcip was considered such a
 
07:06:02.150 --> 07:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
successful Endeavor than 2000 the more
 
07:06:05.090 --> 07:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
familiar l-chip was created
 
07:06:07.968 --> 07:06:07.978 align:start position:0%
each year CLS prepares an annual status
 
07:06:10.310 --> 07:06:10.320 align:start position:0%

this document found on the CLS website
 
07:06:18.850 --> 07:06:18.860 align:start position:0%
succinctly explains the program RSA 162c
 
07:06:21.590 --> 07:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
governs court and includes clcip
 
07:06:24.288 --> 07:06:24.298 align:start position:0%
properties the main source of funding
 
07:06:26.530 --> 07:06:26.540 align:start position:0%
for CLS comes from the endowment
 
07:06:29.390 --> 07:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
administered by cord that was set up in
 
07:06:32.570 --> 07:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
1993 to provide for the Perpetual
 
07:06:35.230 --> 07:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
stewardship of the lcip conservation
 
07:06:38.930 --> 07:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
interests in front of you are two charts
 
07:06:41.628 --> 07:06:41.638 align:start position:0%
that illustrate the makeup of CLS the
 
07:06:43.788 --> 07:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
first chart articulates the parts of
 
07:06:46.190 --> 07:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
lcip land conservation investment
 
07:06:48.650 --> 07:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
program which was the original program
 
07:06:50.990 --> 07:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
the second chart illustrates the entire
 
07:06:52.850 --> 07:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
CLS program
 
07:06:56.330 --> 07:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
that includes the responsibilities that
 
07:06:58.368 --> 07:06:58.378 align:start position:0%
CLS has taken on through memorandum
 
07:07:00.350 --> 07:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
agreement with New Hampshire Fish and
 
07:07:02.330 --> 07:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
Game and the division of forest and
 
07:07:05.810 --> 07:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
landsat dncr these moas provide the
 
07:07:07.430 --> 07:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
other sources of funding that support
 
07:07:11.030 --> 07:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
CLS CLS does not receive General funds
 
07:07:13.850 --> 07:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
the majority of these properties CLS
 
07:07:17.030 --> 07:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
Works primarily with are conservation
 
07:07:19.310 --> 07:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
easements these are privately owned
 
07:07:21.110 --> 07:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
properties in which the state holds a
 
07:07:23.330 --> 07:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
legal interest and has a primary
 
07:07:25.730 --> 07:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
stewardship responsibility
 
07:07:28.610 --> 07:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
CLS also works with 78 municipalities
 
07:07:32.750 --> 07:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
that participated in lcip as well the
 
07:07:34.368 --> 07:07:34.378 align:start position:0%
municipalities hold the primary
 
07:07:36.948 --> 07:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
stewardship responsibility for these 250
 
07:07:39.830 --> 07:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
plus conservation properties
 
07:07:42.170 --> 07:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
we refer to the overarching function
 
07:07:44.390 --> 07:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
that CLS performs as stewardship and
 
07:07:46.910 --> 07:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring the responsibility is to keep
 
07:07:48.890 --> 07:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
an eye on each property to ensure that
 
07:07:51.530 --> 07:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
the conservation conservation values the
 
07:07:54.650 --> 07:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
state invested in remain intact we do
 
07:07:56.330 --> 07:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
this through regular Communications with
 
07:07:58.968 --> 07:07:58.978 align:start position:0%
the landowners and municipalities in
 
07:08:01.628 --> 07:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
conjunction with site visits
 
07:08:04.850 --> 07:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
and lastly I would since we're a new
 
07:08:06.788 --> 07:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
agency I'd just like to thank the Das
 
07:08:10.128 --> 07:08:10.138 align:start position:0%
fiscal and HR folks for being so
 
07:08:12.310 --> 07:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
welcoming and helpful
 
07:08:18.288 --> 07:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
to us as a new entity so happy to take
 
07:08:21.170 --> 07:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
any questions and
 
07:08:22.490 --> 07:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
you're as long as you can just talk
 
07:08:23.930 --> 07:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
about some of your challenges maybe you
 
07:08:25.548 --> 07:08:25.558 align:start position:0%
had agencies and departments come in
 
07:08:28.010 --> 07:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
here and talk about that the workforce
 
07:08:29.270 --> 07:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
is their largest challenge we have
 
07:08:33.048 --> 07:08:33.058 align:start position:0%
others that uh affording the the proper
 
07:08:34.730 --> 07:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
amount of technology is their major
 
07:08:37.368 --> 07:08:37.378 align:start position:0%
Challenge and things like that what what
 
07:08:39.410 --> 07:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
are yours going forward do you see that
 
07:08:40.910 --> 07:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to address as far
 
07:08:43.430 --> 07:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
as a budgetary standpoint probably the
 
07:08:46.368 --> 07:08:46.378 align:start position:0%
the single largest one is we our sources
 
07:08:49.690 --> 07:08:49.700 align:start position:0%
are funding are very limited and uh
 
07:08:53.090 --> 07:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh we keep bumping up against what we
 
07:08:55.270 --> 07:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
can draw respect
 
07:08:58.190 --> 07:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
respectfully from the endowment which is
 
07:09:01.190 --> 07:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
5.5 percent is a Max on a rolling
 
07:09:05.868 --> 07:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
12-year 12 quarter uh average and
 
07:09:05.878 --> 07:09:07.128 align:start position:0%
12-year 12 quarter uh average and
um

07:09:07.128 --> 07:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:10.788 --> 07:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
that we just have to figure out the sort
 
07:09:14.090 --> 07:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
of functional challenge is
 
07:09:17.390 --> 07:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
the 78 municipalities with their 250
 
07:09:20.570 --> 07:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
properties and the 200 land owner or
 
07:09:22.670 --> 07:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
properties that have landowners are
 
07:09:24.650 --> 07:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
constantly changing
 
07:09:27.350 --> 07:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
um every property changes ownership or
 
07:09:27.360 --> 07:09:28.670 align:start position:0%
um every property changes ownership or
managers

07:09:28.670 --> 07:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
managers
 
07:09:31.430 --> 07:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
and so we have to keep on top of that
 
07:09:31.440 --> 07:09:33.350 align:start position:0%
and so we have to keep on top of that
just

07:09:33.350 --> 07:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:09:35.990 --> 07:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
um because a new owner
 
07:09:36.000 --> 07:09:37.548 align:start position:0%
um because a new owner
is

07:09:37.548 --> 07:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:09:37.558 --> 07:09:38.090 align:start position:0%
is
um

07:09:38.090 --> 07:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:39.890 --> 07:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
we need to get to know them they need to
 
07:09:41.990 --> 07:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
get to know us
 
07:09:42.000 --> 07:09:42.948 align:start position:0%
get to know us
um

07:09:42.948 --> 07:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:45.530 --> 07:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
a good landowner what we really the most
 
07:09:48.288 --> 07:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
important thing we do is to uh
 
07:09:50.350 --> 07:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
strive to have very good landowner
 
07:09:52.850 --> 07:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
relationships because if we have those
 
07:09:55.510 --> 07:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
our work goes well
 
07:09:58.910 --> 07:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
so um oh and we can use a new car
 
07:10:02.150 --> 07:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:06.590 --> 07:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
and that I haven't figured out but uh
 
07:10:09.830 --> 07:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
so if things are quiet it tends to mean
 
07:10:12.230 --> 07:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
we're doing our job well because really
 
07:10:13.730 --> 07:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
it's to
 
07:10:14.868 --> 07:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
um prevent
 
07:10:17.208 --> 07:10:17.218 align:start position:0%
problems from occurring solve them from
 
07:10:19.490 --> 07:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
the bottom up whenever we can
 
07:10:21.708 --> 07:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
thank you but that answer that get it
 
07:10:26.270 --> 07:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
down Okay I uh so I traveled the
 
07:10:28.610 --> 07:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
countryside with Steve the other day
 
07:10:32.390 --> 07:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
um weeks ago and his interest in the
 
07:10:35.208 --> 07:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
land and um
 
07:10:38.690 --> 07:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
um knowledge of his job is tremendous
 
07:10:40.968 --> 07:10:40.978 align:start position:0%
um the car wasn't great I I agree with
 
07:10:40.978 --> 07:10:42.110 align:start position:0%
um the car wasn't great I I agree with
that

07:10:42.110 --> 07:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:10:43.968 --> 07:10:43.978 align:start position:0%
um but um you know for state car it
 
07:10:45.170 --> 07:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
wasn't bad
 
07:10:45.180 --> 07:10:45.948 align:start position:0%
wasn't bad
um

07:10:45.948 --> 07:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:10:47.690 --> 07:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
I think you're the only person to have
 
07:10:50.150 --> 07:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
ever visited every single property am I
 
07:10:51.830 --> 07:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
correct in that statement correct yeah
 
07:10:54.410 --> 07:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
so uh that in and of itself is
 
07:10:54.420 --> 07:10:55.610 align:start position:0%
so uh that in and of itself is
impressive

07:10:55.610 --> 07:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
07:10:57.230 --> 07:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
um your transfers from other agencies
 
07:10:59.990 --> 07:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
declined from about 68 Grand to about 35
 
07:11:01.968 --> 07:11:01.978 align:start position:0%
Grand in the second year of the budget
 
07:11:04.310 --> 07:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
and and walk us through that because I
 
07:11:05.868 --> 07:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
think broadly speaking that's a
 
07:11:08.030 --> 07:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
challenge we might want to look into yes
 
07:11:11.330 --> 07:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
it is a challenge and uh and we had the
 
07:11:12.948 --> 07:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to chat in the car a little
 
07:11:14.270 --> 07:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
bit about it
 
07:11:17.810 --> 07:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
um basically uh force and lands as part
 
07:11:20.390 --> 07:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
of dncr
 
07:11:23.868 --> 07:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
um we our contract was the for the
 
07:11:26.690 --> 07:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
properties south of Route 2 we'll say
 
07:11:30.110 --> 07:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know from Lancaster to Berlin and
 
07:11:35.150 --> 07:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
they have acquired very large 20 uh uh
 
07:11:38.750 --> 07:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes 143 000 Acres a number
 
07:11:40.190 --> 07:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
of 20 25
 
07:11:42.288 --> 07:11:42.298 align:start position:0%
000 Acre Properties
 
07:11:46.968 --> 07:11:46.978 align:start position:0%
and they are sort of at a staffing
 
07:11:49.490 --> 07:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
capacity and they need to get some other
 
07:11:51.850 --> 07:11:51.860 align:start position:0%
staff help for some other things
 
07:11:55.730 --> 07:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
and so they kind of came to you should
 
07:11:57.770 --> 07:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
get it in their words but I think they
 
07:11:59.990 --> 07:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
came to a a Tipping Point where they
 
07:12:01.730 --> 07:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
said we really need someone to look
 
07:12:05.990 --> 07:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
after all of our easements north of
 
07:12:08.270 --> 07:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
root 2 which tend to be commercial
 
07:12:08.280 --> 07:12:10.010 align:start position:0%
root 2 which tend to be commercial
forests

07:12:10.010 --> 07:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
forests
 
07:12:12.010 --> 07:12:12.020 align:start position:0%
um by and large
 
07:12:14.750 --> 07:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
and so they said let's just have one
 
07:12:16.670 --> 07:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
person do all of our conservation
 
07:12:18.948 --> 07:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
easements along with the other
 
07:12:18.958 --> 07:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
easements along with the other
um

07:12:19.910 --> 07:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:12:22.968 --> 07:12:22.978 align:start position:0%
assignments that this person will get so
 
07:12:25.430 --> 07:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
that means that contract goes away that
 
07:12:28.310 --> 07:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
means we push up against our endowment
 
07:12:31.010 --> 07:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
limit that the other made the major
 
07:12:35.090 --> 07:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
portion of our program and
 
07:12:37.490 --> 07:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
um what I
 
07:12:39.890 --> 07:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh conversed with uh commissioner
 
07:12:42.650 --> 07:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus about was is there may either
 
07:12:44.868 --> 07:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
we have to find a new contract
 
07:12:46.610 --> 07:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
um or
 
07:12:50.208 --> 07:12:50.218 align:start position:0%
Stephen retires and and they create a
 
07:12:52.010 --> 07:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
different model I'm very serious I mean
 
07:12:55.430 --> 07:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
they're you know it something will have
 
07:12:58.190 --> 07:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
to be figured out the good news is
 
07:12:59.448 --> 07:12:59.458 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
07:13:03.010 --> 07:13:03.020 align:start position:0%
a couple years to figure it out and um
 
07:13:05.750 --> 07:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
I'm all ears for any ideas on anything
 
07:13:08.150 --> 07:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:13:10.070 --> 07:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
um so that it sounds to me like the
 
07:13:11.628 --> 07:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
issue is we have to either solve a
 
07:13:14.090 --> 07:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollar problem
 
07:13:16.310 --> 07:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um a few years from now
 
07:13:19.010 --> 07:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
um or get rid of the one guy who knows
 
07:13:21.410 --> 07:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
what he's doing yeah
 
07:13:23.090 --> 07:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
which doesn't sound to me like the best
 
07:13:29.390 --> 07:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
option well no you ask my partner and uh
 
07:13:32.750 --> 07:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
I I am very fortunate to also have a uh
 
07:13:36.650 --> 07:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
a young 31 year old um person who joined
 
07:13:40.430 --> 07:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
in June of 2021 who's just uh
 
07:13:40.440 --> 07:13:42.350 align:start position:0%
in June of 2021 who's just uh
technologically

07:13:42.350 --> 07:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
technologically
 
07:13:46.250 --> 07:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
much Superior to myself and very hard
 
07:13:48.948 --> 07:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
worker and so um teaching her everything
 
07:13:53.448 --> 07:13:53.458 align:start position:0%
there is to know so I am replaceable
 
07:13:56.990 --> 07:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:58.910 --> 07:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
very good thank you thank you very much
 
07:14:02.690 --> 07:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:06.170 --> 07:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
in the housing appeal board
 
07:14:07.610 --> 07:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
invite you to come up and give your
 
07:14:11.208 --> 07:14:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:15.830 --> 07:14:15.840 align:start position:0%

state for a few years he's an attorney
 
07:15:02.390 --> 07:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
we were formed in 2020 through some
 
07:15:06.830 --> 07:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
legislative action RSA 679.
 
07:15:09.350 --> 07:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
um I was appointed in July of that year
 
07:15:12.590 --> 07:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
and then through some budget issues and
 
07:15:14.530 --> 07:15:14.540 align:start position:0%
the rest of it actually
 
07:15:19.310 --> 07:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
opened the agency over Johnson Hall in
 
07:15:22.968 --> 07:15:22.978 align:start position:0%
October of 2020. we took our first
 
07:15:26.270 --> 07:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me we hired Elizabeth and she
 
07:15:28.270 --> 07:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
started right after Christmas
 
07:15:34.190 --> 07:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
of 2021 and we opened our doors on 20 in
 
07:15:38.030 --> 07:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
January of 2021 prior to that we
 
07:15:40.570 --> 07:15:40.580 align:start position:0%
literally were shown our space
 
07:15:43.610 --> 07:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
and the next day I brought in pens and
 
07:15:46.010 --> 07:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
paper and then about three weeks later
 
07:15:48.170 --> 07:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
some deaths showed up and so in a very
 
07:15:52.548 --> 07:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
short time period we were able to uh put
 
07:15:55.070 --> 07:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
the agency together but I want to at
 
07:15:57.170 --> 07:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
this point Thank the folks from
 
07:15:59.390 --> 07:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the rest of
 
07:16:01.730 --> 07:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire who um
 
07:16:06.048 --> 07:16:06.058 align:start position:0%
literally held our hand and brought us
 
07:16:08.090 --> 07:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
up to speed
 
07:16:10.910 --> 07:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I was one board member the chair at
 
07:16:13.850 --> 07:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
the time Greg Michaels neither of us had
 
07:16:15.048 --> 07:16:15.058 align:start position:0%
ever worked for the State of New
 
07:16:18.110 --> 07:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we brought Elizabeth back
 
07:16:20.270 --> 07:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
from California thank you very much his
 
07:16:23.090 --> 07:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gal but brought her back
 
07:16:27.590 --> 07:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
and so we were truly clueless on all of
 
07:16:29.330 --> 07:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
this how this all worked and I have to
 
07:16:33.410 --> 07:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
tell you as a native of New Hampshire
 
07:16:37.070 --> 07:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
um I have daily impressed with the
 
07:16:40.368 --> 07:16:40.378 align:start position:0%
quality of the folks that work for our
 
07:16:43.310 --> 07:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
state and and I want to thank these
 
07:16:45.770 --> 07:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
folks here as well as anybody else who
 
07:16:48.948 --> 07:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
ever got a phone call from me or anybody
 
07:16:51.110 --> 07:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
or Elizabeth and and answer the call
 
07:16:54.350 --> 07:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
call explaining in detail what it is
 
07:16:56.330 --> 07:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
that we needed to do
 
07:16:57.830 --> 07:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned earlier with three
 
07:17:00.410 --> 07:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
board members we have a clerk we
 
07:17:03.010 --> 07:17:03.020 align:start position:0%
function very similar to Superior Court
 
07:17:05.868 --> 07:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
and so our clerk is the face of the
 
07:17:05.878 --> 07:17:07.208 align:start position:0%
and so our clerk is the face of the
agency

07:17:07.208 --> 07:17:07.218 align:start position:0%
agency
 
07:17:09.468 --> 07:17:09.478 align:start position:0%
anytime there is an appeal let me
 
07:17:11.330 --> 07:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
explain what it is that we do if there
 
07:17:15.368 --> 07:17:15.378 align:start position:0%
is an appeal that a town or city has
 
07:17:20.750 --> 07:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
denied some aspect of a planning zoning
 
07:17:23.448 --> 07:17:23.458 align:start position:0%
historic district anything involved with
 
07:17:23.458 --> 07:17:24.610 align:start position:0%
historic district anything involved with
housing

07:17:24.610 --> 07:17:24.620 align:start position:0%
housing
 
07:17:28.430 --> 07:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
application in a city or town and they
 
07:17:30.770 --> 07:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
are denied whatever it is that they they
 
07:17:33.708 --> 07:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
have asked for or a piece of it they
 
07:17:35.510 --> 07:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
have two choices within 30 days they can
 
07:17:37.430 --> 07:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
either go to Superior Court or they can
 
07:17:39.288 --> 07:17:39.298 align:start position:0%
come to the house and appeals board
 
07:17:43.190 --> 07:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
and So within those 30 days they file an
 
07:17:46.670 --> 07:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
appeal it's very inexpensive for them to
 
07:17:49.968 --> 07:17:49.978 align:start position:0%
do that within our legislative mandate
 
07:17:51.830 --> 07:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
and also our rules of which Elizabeth
 
07:17:55.010 --> 07:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
was very involved with writing that was
 
07:17:57.650 --> 07:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
an interesting process that we went
 
07:17:57.660 --> 07:17:59.288 align:start position:0%
an interesting process that we went
through

07:17:59.288 --> 07:17:59.298 align:start position:0%
through
 
07:18:03.048 --> 07:18:03.058 align:start position:0%
they can choose to hire an attorney or
 
07:18:04.490 --> 07:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
they can come pro se
 
07:18:07.610 --> 07:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
and appear before our board we're under
 
07:18:10.128 --> 07:18:10.138 align:start position:0%
legislative mandate to within 90 days of
 
07:18:13.070 --> 07:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
the file of that appeal that they have a
 
07:18:15.288 --> 07:18:15.298 align:start position:0%
hearing and that within 60 days
 
07:18:17.810 --> 07:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
following that that they actually get a
 
07:18:20.150 --> 07:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
decision out of us if either party is
 
07:18:21.890 --> 07:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
unhappy with that they have the
 
07:18:24.048 --> 07:18:24.058 align:start position:0%
opportunity within 30 days to to appeal
 
07:18:25.730 --> 07:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
it directly to the New Hampshire Supreme
 
07:18:29.868 --> 07:18:29.878 align:start position:0%
Court the beauty of that is if any of
 
07:18:31.070 --> 07:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
you are familiar with housing
 
07:18:34.610 --> 07:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
development it's a long hard pull to try
 
07:18:35.890 --> 07:18:35.900 align:start position:0%
and get
 
07:18:38.868 --> 07:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
projects across the state in any
 
07:18:38.878 --> 07:18:39.968 align:start position:0%
projects across the state in any
Community

07:18:39.968 --> 07:18:39.978 align:start position:0%
Community
 
07:18:42.350 --> 07:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
to be approved and there are many many
 
07:18:44.570 --> 07:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in the state that do it
 
07:18:46.128 --> 07:18:46.138 align:start position:0%
very very efficiently but there are some
 
07:18:48.708 --> 07:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
towns and cities that struggle with that
 
07:18:51.350 --> 07:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
and so we are an alternative to Superior
 
07:18:54.468 --> 07:18:54.478 align:start position:0%
Court in that we have a short window in
 
07:18:57.288 --> 07:18:57.298 align:start position:0%
which they have to that we need to
 
07:19:00.110 --> 07:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
respond and often and this is not a dig
 
07:19:01.910 --> 07:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
at Superior Court but often it can be
 
07:19:03.350 --> 07:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
nine months before you even get your
 
07:19:06.110 --> 07:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
initial hearing and then you get ready
 
07:19:08.990 --> 07:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
to go to court so we think that um what
 
07:19:11.030 --> 07:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing is a service to the property
 
07:19:12.830 --> 07:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
owners of the state and also the cities
 
07:19:14.690 --> 07:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
and towns
 
07:19:18.410 --> 07:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
um this is our first budget process
 
07:19:20.270 --> 07:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
um the first one I think came out of the
 
07:19:22.190 --> 07:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
07:19:24.830 --> 07:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and um through the legislative
 
07:19:28.788 --> 07:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
process and then even the revision of
 
07:19:30.110 --> 07:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
that because at one point we were
 
07:19:30.120 --> 07:19:32.170 align:start position:0%
that because at one point we were
defunded

07:19:32.170 --> 07:19:32.180 align:start position:0%
defunded
 
07:19:35.208 --> 07:19:35.218 align:start position:0%
was through the legislative process and
 
07:19:37.788 --> 07:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
so again I want to thank everybody from
 
07:19:40.850 --> 07:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
the division of administrative services
 
07:19:43.850 --> 07:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
for helping us understand what we needed
 
07:19:46.070 --> 07:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
to do the numbers that you see before us
 
07:19:50.030 --> 07:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think are pretty Bare Bones 99 of them
 
07:19:52.730 --> 07:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
have been provided to us by the various
 
07:19:55.430 --> 07:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
state agencies that we depend on to
 
07:19:58.010 --> 07:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
fulfill our mission and and our
 
07:20:00.708 --> 07:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
legislative mandate
 
07:20:00.718 --> 07:20:01.368 align:start position:0%
legislative mandate
um

07:20:01.368 --> 07:20:01.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:03.410 --> 07:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
if you have questions with regards to
 
07:20:06.410 --> 07:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
our orders and our decisions we have a
 
07:20:10.610 --> 07:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
very robust uh um website in which once
 
07:20:12.410 --> 07:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
the 30 days have passed from when we've
 
07:20:15.230 --> 07:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
made a decision we put all of our orders
 
07:20:17.330 --> 07:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
up on on the website and so they're
 
07:20:20.208 --> 07:20:20.218 align:start position:0%
available to the communities to read to
 
07:20:22.968 --> 07:20:22.978 align:start position:0%
the anybody who's interested in this and
 
07:20:25.070 --> 07:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
we take a lot of time to write these
 
07:20:26.750 --> 07:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
orders and try and use them as an
 
07:20:28.548 --> 07:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity to explain to
 
07:20:30.048 --> 07:20:30.058 align:start position:0%
people just what the rules and
 
07:20:32.628 --> 07:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
regulations are with regards to housing
 
07:20:35.390 --> 07:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
and Housing Development one last thing
 
07:20:38.810 --> 07:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
is uh often people will say well you
 
07:20:40.430 --> 07:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
know you're a super zoning board or your
 
07:20:42.948 --> 07:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
super planning board we're not we take a
 
07:20:44.690 --> 07:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
look at what your rules are in your
 
07:20:49.368 --> 07:20:49.378 align:start position:0%
community and we act accordingly so I'll
 
07:20:52.690 --> 07:20:52.700 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you might have
 
07:20:56.530 --> 07:20:56.540 align:start position:0%
sure I have a lot but it's it's um
 
07:20:59.510 --> 07:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
your agency is one where where it's one
 
07:21:01.968 --> 07:21:01.978 align:start position:0%
where uh it's obviously taking a lot of
 
07:21:04.610 --> 07:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
scrutiny they're not decorating but the
 
07:21:07.250 --> 07:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
what you do with land and Land
 
07:21:10.190 --> 07:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
Development and especially the need for
 
07:21:12.468 --> 07:21:12.478 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing and and things like
 
07:21:14.690 --> 07:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
that which have come to the Forefront
 
07:21:17.570 --> 07:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
of of state government and certainly a
 
07:21:20.090 --> 07:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
politics in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:21:22.548 --> 07:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be sure that I mean
 
07:21:24.948 --> 07:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
you you came you were you were born in
 
07:21:28.670 --> 07:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
an area of covid and came into being in
 
07:21:32.810 --> 07:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
the state in that in that time frame uh
 
07:21:35.868 --> 07:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
going forward though looking more
 
07:21:39.170 --> 07:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
towards a uh hopefully a more
 
07:21:43.670 --> 07:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh calmer time yeah do you believe you
 
07:21:43.680 --> 07:21:44.510 align:start position:0%
uh calmer time yeah do you believe you
have

07:21:44.510 --> 07:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:21:47.448 --> 07:21:47.458 align:start position:0%
the proper resources in this budget to
 
07:21:50.090 --> 07:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
meet everything that's going on now and
 
07:21:51.288 --> 07:21:51.298 align:start position:0%
then going forward into the next
 
07:21:51.298 --> 07:21:52.490 align:start position:0%
then going forward into the next
biennium

07:21:52.490 --> 07:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
07:21:54.830 --> 07:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
we think that we do the challenge is
 
07:21:57.770 --> 07:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
that we never know what's going to come
 
07:22:01.730 --> 07:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
through the door with regards to cases
 
07:22:03.170 --> 07:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
um we were doing some statistical
 
07:22:05.448 --> 07:22:05.458 align:start position:0%
information and as I said we opened in
 
07:22:08.510 --> 07:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
January 2021 and for that first year we
 
07:22:08.520 --> 07:22:09.530 align:start position:0%
January 2021 and for that first year we
had

07:22:09.530 --> 07:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
had
 
07:22:11.510 --> 07:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
um somewhere in the K in the line of 29
 
07:22:13.610 --> 07:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
cases okay
 
07:22:16.610 --> 07:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
um we've already surpassed that now and
 
07:22:19.010 --> 07:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
so more and more entities are
 
07:22:23.150 --> 07:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this opportunity exists
 
07:22:24.948 --> 07:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
and are taking advantage of them now
 
07:22:27.230 --> 07:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
some cases take longer some cases take
 
07:22:28.968 --> 07:22:28.978 align:start position:0%
shorter time because it might be less
 
07:22:28.978 --> 07:22:30.708 align:start position:0%
shorter time because it might be less
complicated

07:22:30.708 --> 07:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
07:22:34.010 --> 07:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
um so we hope that that is the case we
 
07:22:36.110 --> 07:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
have within our budget some funds that
 
07:22:39.548 --> 07:22:39.558 align:start position:0%
if we needed to bring in some additional
 
07:22:41.990 --> 07:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
Legal Assistance or engineering
 
07:22:44.750 --> 07:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
assistance then we can do that and so
 
07:22:46.788 --> 07:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
we'll try very very hard to make sure
 
07:22:49.128 --> 07:22:49.138 align:start position:0%
that we fit within that now if all of a
 
07:22:51.530 --> 07:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
sudden you know the floodgates open and
 
07:22:52.850 --> 07:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of stuff that is
 
07:22:55.190 --> 07:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
coming through the door then I suggest
 
07:22:56.810 --> 07:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
we'll have to have another conversation
 
07:22:58.368 --> 07:22:58.378 align:start position:0%
but at this particular point in time
 
07:23:00.350 --> 07:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
we're a pretty well-oiled machine
 
07:23:03.468 --> 07:23:03.478 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Keeps Us in line we all know
 
07:23:06.770 --> 07:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
what we need to do and um I think we're
 
07:23:08.930 --> 07:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
pretty uh efficient in what it is that
 
07:23:11.448 --> 07:23:11.458 align:start position:0%
we do how do you provide for your legal
 
07:23:12.830 --> 07:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
services or additional Legal Services
 
07:23:15.230 --> 07:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
you contract out at this point we have
 
07:23:16.968 --> 07:23:16.978 align:start position:0%
not had to do that
 
07:23:19.670 --> 07:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
um we the legislative mandate there is
 
07:23:22.190 --> 07:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for recusal should I
 
07:23:24.948 --> 07:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
have a conflict then I need to
 
07:23:26.868 --> 07:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't do but the Supreme
 
07:23:28.968 --> 07:23:28.978 align:start position:0%
Court identifies somebody to take my
 
07:23:31.850 --> 07:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
place it's the attorney needs to recuse
 
07:23:33.530 --> 07:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
themselves because they have a conflict
 
07:23:35.448 --> 07:23:35.458 align:start position:0%
or whatever the issue is or the engineer
 
07:23:37.910 --> 07:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
does that so we have some folks who have
 
07:23:42.288 --> 07:23:42.298 align:start position:0%
been vetted by the Supreme Court and
 
07:23:44.570 --> 07:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
um they identify who it is that's going
 
07:23:46.430 --> 07:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
to come on to the case and so those
 
07:23:50.448 --> 07:23:50.458 align:start position:0%
folks have paid 75 a day in order to do
 
07:23:53.390 --> 07:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
this and so in many cases they are doing
 
07:23:55.070 --> 07:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
it for the good of the community in the
 
07:23:56.628 --> 07:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
good of the state it's certainly
 
07:23:58.750 --> 07:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
nobody's making any money in this deal
 
07:24:01.430 --> 07:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
but we try very very hard to make sure
 
07:24:03.530 --> 07:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
that you know we can do it within a
 
07:24:05.628 --> 07:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
budget so I'm comfortable with it but
 
07:24:08.090 --> 07:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
again if all of a sudden we start
 
07:24:11.208 --> 07:24:11.218 align:start position:0%
getting you know three cases a week then
 
07:24:12.350 --> 07:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have a
 
07:24:14.390 --> 07:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
conversation but at this particular
 
07:24:15.708 --> 07:24:15.718 align:start position:0%
point in time we're pretty comfortable
 
07:24:18.708 --> 07:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
with it okay good thank you
 
07:24:18.718 --> 07:24:25.190 align:start position:0%
with it okay good thank you
foreign

07:24:25.190 --> 07:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:27.890 --> 07:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
state has a lot of adjudicative bodies
 
07:24:29.930 --> 07:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry the state has a lot of
 
07:24:31.788 --> 07:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
adjudicative bodies that don't have
 
07:24:34.070 --> 07:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
space yeah where do you hold your
 
07:24:34.080 --> 07:24:35.150 align:start position:0%
space yeah where do you hold your
hearings

07:24:35.150 --> 07:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
07:24:36.830 --> 07:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
what do you what where do you hold your
 
07:24:39.650 --> 07:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
hearings we hold our hearings in um
 
07:24:43.610 --> 07:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
Johnson Hall in room 315 and
 
07:24:47.810 --> 07:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
um room 315 is a uh space that is
 
07:24:49.788 --> 07:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
available for
 
07:24:52.610 --> 07:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
um pretty much anybody who is tied to
 
07:24:54.830 --> 07:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
07:24:56.628 --> 07:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
um we outfitted it
 
07:25:00.288 --> 07:25:00.298 align:start position:0%
um the office of child advocacy gave us
 
07:25:02.750 --> 07:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
a table I went over to the barn and the
 
07:25:04.610 --> 07:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
farm and we got some tables and chairs
 
07:25:06.110 --> 07:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
and those kinds of things but the space
 
07:25:07.150 --> 07:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
is available
 
07:25:10.910 --> 07:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
there is a calendar that folks can go on
 
07:25:13.548 --> 07:25:13.558 align:start position:0%
to and Reserve that space getting in and
 
07:25:14.990 --> 07:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
out of the buildings a little bit of a
 
07:25:16.250 --> 07:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
challenge sometimes for the different
 
07:25:18.230 --> 07:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
agencies but the space is available and
 
07:25:19.390 --> 07:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's used
 
07:25:21.788 --> 07:25:21.798 align:start position:0%
do you
 
07:25:24.110 --> 07:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
ever think that
 
07:25:24.120 --> 07:25:25.670 align:start position:0%
ever think that
um

07:25:25.670 --> 07:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:27.530 --> 07:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
this comes up a lot with a with a bunch
 
07:25:30.110 --> 07:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
of people who are who are you happen to
 
07:25:32.030 --> 07:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
have a hearing space that you shared
 
07:25:33.890 --> 07:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
room in your building but there are a
 
07:25:36.170 --> 07:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
bunch of people who sort of um
 
07:25:39.170 --> 07:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
um are vagabonds if you will and uh
 
07:25:40.850 --> 07:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
probably six six or seven different
 
07:25:40.860 --> 07:25:42.468 align:start position:0%
probably six six or seven different
boards

07:25:42.468 --> 07:25:42.478 align:start position:0%
boards
 
07:25:42.478 --> 07:25:43.910 align:start position:0%
boards
um

07:25:43.910 --> 07:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:45.530 --> 07:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
how often do you use the space do you
 
07:25:47.510 --> 07:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
think there would be obstacles to being
 
07:25:49.990 --> 07:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
co-located with other
 
07:25:52.730 --> 07:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
bodies other boards that have have to
 
07:25:56.208 --> 07:25:56.218 align:start position:0%
have hearings and sharing the rooms to
 
07:25:58.910 --> 07:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
come to come to use that well no what if
 
07:26:00.530 --> 07:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
we moved you let's just say for the sake
 
07:26:02.090 --> 07:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
of argument somebody once decided that
 
07:26:04.250 --> 07:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
that building could be made better
 
07:26:07.310 --> 07:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
oh it seems unlikely yeah um well you
 
07:26:09.410 --> 07:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
know that's in all honesty that's up to
 
07:26:10.968 --> 07:26:10.978 align:start position:0%
you folks to make that to make that
 
07:26:10.978 --> 07:26:12.530 align:start position:0%
you folks to make that to make that
decision

07:26:12.530 --> 07:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
decision
 
07:26:13.730 --> 07:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
um I think that there's certainly
 
07:26:16.548 --> 07:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity if some of the Vagabond
 
07:26:18.830 --> 07:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
groups that you're talking about would
 
07:26:21.170 --> 07:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
like to come and use a space you know we
 
07:26:23.930 --> 07:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
reserve Tuesdays and Thursdays for our
 
07:26:23.940 --> 07:26:25.490 align:start position:0%
reserve Tuesdays and Thursdays for our
hearings

07:26:25.490 --> 07:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
07:26:27.048 --> 07:26:27.058 align:start position:0%
um but that leaves Monday Wednesday and
 
07:26:29.390 --> 07:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
Friday for folks to be able to use that
 
07:26:32.868 --> 07:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
space and also if we have don't have a
 
07:26:34.368 --> 07:26:34.378 align:start position:0%
particular hearing or only have a
 
07:26:36.590 --> 07:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
hearing in the morning then they can
 
07:26:40.788 --> 07:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
certainly contact the um the clerk and
 
07:26:42.948 --> 07:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
we'd be more than happy to to give the
 
07:26:45.830 --> 07:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
space up part of the challenge was and
 
07:26:48.048 --> 07:26:48.058 align:start position:0%
why we ended up going up to 315 was that
 
07:26:49.610 --> 07:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
once covid
 
07:26:51.230 --> 07:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
um when Once the state opened it up
 
07:26:55.270 --> 07:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
again we had space about the size of
 
07:26:58.490 --> 07:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
this area rug in order to hold our
 
07:27:00.590 --> 07:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
hearings and so if you start to have
 
07:27:02.448 --> 07:27:02.458 align:start position:0%
parties that come in in the six or seven
 
07:27:04.190 --> 07:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
people and we do have them we also have
 
07:27:06.350 --> 07:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
have some visitors people are sometimes
 
07:27:08.868 --> 07:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
curious about what it is that we do and
 
07:27:11.030 --> 07:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
so we'll have folks who come in and
 
07:27:12.770 --> 07:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
there'll be four or five other people
 
07:27:14.510 --> 07:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
from different communities that are
 
07:27:16.368 --> 07:27:16.378 align:start position:0%
going what is this happen it feels bored
 
07:27:19.968 --> 07:27:19.978 align:start position:0%
and and what is it that they do we also
 
07:27:19.978 --> 07:27:21.410 align:start position:0%
and and what is it that they do we also
um

07:27:21.410 --> 07:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:25.670 --> 07:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh use the WebEx system and so we often
 
07:27:28.670 --> 07:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
have many many people that watch the
 
07:27:31.070 --> 07:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
proceedings and whatever the schedule is
 
07:27:32.750 --> 07:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's clearly onto our website
 
07:27:34.430 --> 07:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth takes care of all of those
 
07:27:34.440 --> 07:27:36.110 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth takes care of all of those
details

07:27:36.110 --> 07:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
details
 
07:27:40.010 --> 07:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:40.020 --> 07:27:44.570 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:27:44.570 --> 07:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:47.270 --> 07:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
I just had a
 
07:27:49.430 --> 07:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
sort of just your resources
 
07:27:51.048 --> 07:27:51.058 align:start position:0%
um I think you said statutorily you have
 
07:27:53.390 --> 07:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
90 days that you have to have a hearing
 
07:27:56.448 --> 07:27:56.458 align:start position:0%
and then you have decisions within 60.
 
07:27:58.010 --> 07:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
um are you are those deadlines
 
07:27:59.990 --> 07:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable for you or you know you said
 
07:28:02.628 --> 07:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
you are very efficient you know group
 
07:28:05.090 --> 07:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
but it was that is that well I think
 
07:28:06.530 --> 07:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
they are
 
07:28:08.628 --> 07:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
um um and part of it is the makeup of
 
07:28:10.010 --> 07:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
the board
 
07:28:13.070 --> 07:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
um all three of us this is not our first
 
07:28:15.590 --> 07:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity in dealing with land use and
 
07:28:15.600 --> 07:28:16.730 align:start position:0%
opportunity in dealing with land use and
so

07:28:16.730 --> 07:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:28:18.708 --> 07:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
um we're blessed in that both with Ed
 
07:28:21.048 --> 07:28:21.058 align:start position:0%
and and Mike
 
07:28:23.208 --> 07:28:23.218 align:start position:0%
um the attorney and the engineer they
 
07:28:25.910 --> 07:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
have uh been in that business for a long
 
07:28:28.610 --> 07:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
time I also come from uh I'm second
 
07:28:31.670 --> 07:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
generation developer my dad was a
 
07:28:33.350 --> 07:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
developer and I've done quite a few
 
07:28:37.368 --> 07:28:37.378 align:start position:0%
projects and so this is not a new
 
07:28:40.368 --> 07:28:40.378 align:start position:0%
um Avenue for us and as we've gotten to
 
07:28:42.410 --> 07:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
know each other we sort of fairly
 
07:28:45.230 --> 07:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
quickly get a feel for where this is
 
07:28:47.150 --> 07:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
probably going to go and then it's a
 
07:28:49.330 --> 07:28:49.340 align:start position:0%
matter of making sure that we're
 
07:28:53.270 --> 07:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
following the statutory requirements but
 
07:28:55.310 --> 07:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
also the statutory decisions that have
 
07:28:58.310 --> 07:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
been made with regards to land use and
 
07:29:00.350 --> 07:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
then always looking back at What's
 
07:29:03.170 --> 07:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
called the certified record which is the
 
07:29:05.810 --> 07:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
story about how the folks got before us
 
07:29:07.730 --> 07:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
and what it is at the Town our
 
07:29:10.968 --> 07:29:10.978 align:start position:0%
municipality did so it's a little tight
 
07:29:13.128 --> 07:29:13.138 align:start position:0%
and I'm always kind of cracking the whip
 
07:29:15.770 --> 07:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
that you know we've got an order due
 
07:29:18.948 --> 07:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
um next Monday right next Monday and so
 
07:29:21.048 --> 07:29:21.058 align:start position:0%
you know we'll finish that up this week
 
07:29:23.810 --> 07:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
and then Elizabeth will do her magic and
 
07:29:26.930 --> 07:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
it will be issued
 
07:29:29.990 --> 07:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
so it's tight but we get it done and you
 
07:29:31.128 --> 07:29:31.138 align:start position:0%
know you
 
07:29:32.810 --> 07:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
you give us another 60 days we'd
 
07:29:35.090 --> 07:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
probably take it but it just keeps
 
07:29:36.650 --> 07:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
things moving along and it allows people
 
07:29:39.708 --> 07:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
to be able to make decisions as well
 
07:29:41.930 --> 07:29:41.940 align:start position:0%

07:34:21.770 --> 07:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the office as a resource to
 
07:34:23.510 --> 07:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
understand and advocate for children and
 
07:34:25.730 --> 07:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
the best child serving system
 
07:34:27.548 --> 07:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
food is within this role would include
 
07:34:30.110 --> 07:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
extended Outreach efforts via an active
 
07:34:31.610 --> 07:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
social media presence an enhanced
 
07:34:33.890 --> 07:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
website additional education efforts
 
07:34:35.390 --> 07:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
through Community partner sites and
 
07:34:37.250 --> 07:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
trainings offered about the Mandate of
 
07:34:39.170 --> 07:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate state
 
07:34:41.208 --> 07:34:41.218 align:start position:0%
agencies policy and procedure and
 
07:34:43.910 --> 07:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
available community-based programs
 
07:34:45.288 --> 07:34:45.298 align:start position:0%
much of the world has shifted to
 
07:34:46.730 --> 07:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
utilizing technology for information
 
07:34:48.530 --> 07:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
gathering and sharing youth especially
 
07:34:50.390 --> 07:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
currently the office of social media
 
07:34:51.708 --> 07:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
accounts and website but given the
 
07:34:53.390 --> 07:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
limited resources within the office it
 
07:34:55.010 --> 07:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
is difficult to keep these up to date
 
07:34:57.170 --> 07:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
and to offer creative forms of Outreach
 
07:34:59.390 --> 07:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
such as educational videos
 
07:35:01.788 --> 07:35:01.798 align:start position:0%
this position will ensure the office is
 
07:35:03.530 --> 07:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
known as a resource and recognized as
 
07:35:04.910 --> 07:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
well as assist children families to
 
07:35:07.190 --> 07:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
navigate systems most effectively
 
07:35:10.310 --> 07:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
so sorry I mentioned that already there
 
07:35:11.930 --> 07:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
um there have been requests for
 
07:35:14.030 --> 07:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
additional Community Partners by
 
07:35:16.128 --> 07:35:16.138 align:start position:0%
additional Community Partners to attend
 
07:35:18.350 --> 07:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
meetings for further Outreach and
 
07:35:19.968 --> 07:35:19.978 align:start position:0%
explaining of a mandate of the office
 
07:35:21.830 --> 07:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
but given the high workload and current
 
07:35:23.990 --> 07:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing much of these have had to be
 
07:35:27.110 --> 07:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 2023.
 
07:35:29.030 --> 07:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
the office currently has a legal
 
07:35:30.890 --> 07:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
secretary part-time position which we
 
07:35:32.448 --> 07:35:32.458 align:start position:0%
would like to extend to a full-time
 
07:35:34.968 --> 07:35:34.978 align:start position:0%
position for fiscal year 24. the primary
 
07:35:36.350 --> 07:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this role is to
 
07:35:38.090 --> 07:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
manage data entry of all the incidents
 
07:35:39.890 --> 07:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
we receive including restraints and
 
07:35:39.900 --> 07:35:41.448 align:start position:0%
we receive including restraints and
seclusion

07:35:41.448 --> 07:35:41.458 align:start position:0%
seclusion
 
07:35:43.368 --> 07:35:43.378 align:start position:0%
dcy of compliance with reporting
 
07:35:46.788 --> 07:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
incidents commenced in December 2019 in
 
07:35:50.510 --> 07:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
2021 we received 1909 where as I
 
07:35:54.410 --> 07:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned in 2022 we received 2508.
 
07:35:57.230 --> 07:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
which is that 31 increase the volume is
 
07:35:58.850 --> 07:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
beyond capacity for other positions
 
07:36:00.830 --> 07:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
within the office the mandates or
 
07:36:02.390 --> 07:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
surveil incidents will go unmet without
 
07:36:04.310 --> 07:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
this position with the increase in
 
07:36:05.868 --> 07:36:05.878 align:start position:0%
critical incident reports received is
 
07:36:07.310 --> 07:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
impossible to review and enter all
 
07:36:09.650 --> 07:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
immediately which decreases our capacity
 
07:36:11.810 --> 07:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
to provide timely relevant data analysis
 
07:36:14.628 --> 07:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
for system support and reform
 
07:36:16.070 --> 07:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
more hours for this position would
 
07:36:17.868 --> 07:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
optimize the data analysis and further
 
07:36:20.390 --> 07:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
support the mission of the office
 
07:36:23.750 --> 07:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the office worked with the
 
07:36:25.610 --> 07:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology and
 
07:36:27.048 --> 07:36:27.058 align:start position:0%
Department administrative services to
 
07:36:28.910 --> 07:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
enhance our ability to use and format
 
07:36:30.770 --> 07:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
Salesforce that is our our third
 
07:36:32.628 --> 07:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
prioritized need there
 
07:36:35.390 --> 07:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
we use the Salesforce platform for case
 
07:36:36.650 --> 07:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
management and data collection
 
07:36:36.660 --> 07:36:39.708 align:start position:0%
management and data collection
concurrently

07:36:39.708 --> 07:36:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:42.170 --> 07:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
and with this we monitor for Trends and
 
07:36:45.890 --> 07:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
make recommendations to improve systems
 
07:36:47.750 --> 07:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
our sales force case management system
 
07:36:49.368 --> 07:36:49.378 align:start position:0%
is an unfinished pilot of the State of
 
07:36:50.690 --> 07:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire New Hampshire Enterprise
 
07:36:52.730 --> 07:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
that must now be enhanced for purposes
 
07:36:54.288 --> 07:36:54.298 align:start position:0%
of usability and generation of
 
07:36:56.510 --> 07:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
meaningful data including measuring
 
07:36:58.730 --> 07:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
outcomes of the office's work this
 
07:37:00.230 --> 07:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
product is intended to better capture
 
07:37:00.240 --> 07:37:02.510 align:start position:0%
product is intended to better capture
data

07:37:02.510 --> 07:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
data
 
07:37:04.610 --> 07:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
allowing for consistency and data entry
 
07:37:06.830 --> 07:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
and optimizing substance of reporting at
 
07:37:08.208 --> 07:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
the end of the project the office will
 
07:37:10.730 --> 07:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
be able to provide more context in
 
07:37:12.948 --> 07:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
reports and system reform efforts
 
07:37:15.110 --> 07:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
system improvements will also allow for
 
07:37:17.090 --> 07:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
better ability to track state agency and
 
07:37:19.250 --> 07:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
child serving agencies compliance with
 
07:37:21.048 --> 07:37:21.058 align:start position:0%
contracts laws and policies and
 
07:37:21.058 --> 07:37:22.128 align:start position:0%
contracts laws and policies and
procedures

07:37:22.128 --> 07:37:22.138 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
07:37:23.990 --> 07:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
without this enhancement the office will
 
07:37:26.090 --> 07:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
have delayed or insufficient data
 
07:37:27.468 --> 07:37:27.478 align:start position:0%
capture and less timely investigations
 
07:37:29.868 --> 07:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
related directly to Children's current
 
07:37:32.030 --> 07:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
safety and well-being the office will
 
07:37:33.650 --> 07:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
also have decreased capacity to measure
 
07:37:35.090 --> 07:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
outcomes and provide timely relevant
 
07:37:36.590 --> 07:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations for system support and
 
07:37:38.930 --> 07:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
reform and RFI was put out in the fall
 
07:37:41.208 --> 07:37:41.218 align:start position:0%
of 2021 and our queue process was
 
07:37:44.330 --> 07:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
completed in the spring of 2022 looking
 
07:37:46.730 --> 07:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
at the most minimal version to meet the
 
07:37:48.410 --> 07:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
office's needs and it was determined the
 
07:37:49.670 --> 07:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
minimum amount needed for that project
 
07:37:51.288 --> 07:37:51.298 align:start position:0%
is two hundred thousand dollars which
 
07:37:53.270 --> 07:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
would be a one-time project
 
07:37:55.968 --> 07:37:55.978 align:start position:0%
the office was created for oversight the
 
07:37:57.468 --> 07:37:57.478 align:start position:0%
importance of which elevates in times of
 
07:37:59.448 --> 07:37:59.458 align:start position:0%
economic and social crisis there is an
 
07:38:00.770 --> 07:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
abundance of evidence demonstrating
 
07:38:02.750 --> 07:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
societal stress paralleling stress on
 
07:38:04.368 --> 07:38:04.378 align:start position:0%
state Social Services
 
07:38:06.230 --> 07:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is a point of highest risk and
 
07:38:08.448 --> 07:38:08.458 align:start position:0%
liability for State systems both the
 
07:38:10.190 --> 07:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
children and the state benefit from a
 
07:38:11.990 --> 07:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
focus on prevention by accessing
 
07:38:13.910 --> 07:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
services within the community and an
 
07:38:16.250 --> 07:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
independent eye on overwhelmed systems
 
07:38:19.430 --> 07:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
to ensure best outcomes for children
 
07:38:22.128 --> 07:38:22.138 align:start position:0%
to meet this Mandate of RSA 21v
 
07:38:24.048 --> 07:38:24.058 align:start position:0%
equitably in a timely manner the office
 
07:38:27.048 --> 07:38:27.058 align:start position:0%
is requesting a prioritized budget of
 
07:38:29.330 --> 07:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
one million two hundred and five
 
07:38:32.448 --> 07:38:32.458 align:start position:0%
thousand for fiscal year 24 and 1
 
07:38:36.650 --> 07:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
million 27 000 for fiscal year 25.
 
07:38:38.330 --> 07:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and please let me know if you
 
07:38:41.868 --> 07:38:41.878 align:start position:0%
have any questions thank you
 
07:38:41.878 --> 07:38:43.610 align:start position:0%
have any questions thank you
yeah

07:38:43.610 --> 07:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:38:47.448 --> 07:38:47.458 align:start position:0%
um the question is on in this handle you
 
07:38:48.890 --> 07:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned that from the last the last
 
07:38:51.170 --> 07:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
year from October 1st 2021 to September
 
07:38:55.128 --> 07:38:55.138 align:start position:0%
30th 2022 you had 2508 incident reports
 
07:38:58.850 --> 07:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
how does that Stack Up historically and
 
07:39:02.270 --> 07:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
is there I guess my assumption would be
 
07:39:05.090 --> 07:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
that that number is low because during
 
07:39:06.590 --> 07:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
that time it was covered people kids
 
07:39:07.910 --> 07:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
were locked down they weren't in school
 
07:39:10.430 --> 07:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
they abused it some were facing couldn't
 
07:39:13.730 --> 07:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
be visibly seen and reported uh since
 
07:39:14.810 --> 07:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
we've come out of that and because
 
07:39:16.190 --> 07:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
you're back in school have you started
 
07:39:19.250 --> 07:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
to see an uptick of that and so really
 
07:39:22.430 --> 07:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
that 2508 number historically where has
 
07:39:23.510 --> 07:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
this been and where do you think it's
 
07:39:25.610 --> 07:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
going so there's not too much historical
 
07:39:27.048 --> 07:39:27.058 align:start position:0%
data unfortunately because the data
 
07:39:27.058 --> 07:39:28.010 align:start position:0%
data unfortunately because the data
capture

07:39:28.010 --> 07:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
capture
 
07:39:30.350 --> 07:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
um with the division began in 2019 so
 
07:39:31.730 --> 07:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
they don't have extremely extensive
 
07:39:33.590 --> 07:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
historical data but what we do
 
07:39:35.750 --> 07:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
understand also is that there are some
 
07:39:37.548 --> 07:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
limitations to the the compliance and
 
07:39:38.810 --> 07:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
the reporting
 
07:39:40.368 --> 07:39:40.378 align:start position:0%
um so we do foresee there being more
 
07:39:43.010 --> 07:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
than than what we have here we have
 
07:39:44.448 --> 07:39:44.458 align:start position:0%
programs that replace children out of
 
07:39:45.948 --> 07:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
state and although they are contracted
 
07:39:47.990 --> 07:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
with our state to provide reports for
 
07:39:51.890 --> 07:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
all incidents the ability to oversee and
 
07:39:54.530 --> 07:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
ensure their compliance is a bit more
 
07:39:56.570 --> 07:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
difficult to do than in-state programs
 
07:39:58.310 --> 07:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
so we may be missing some of those in
 
07:40:00.650 --> 07:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
our data capture and we also at this
 
07:40:03.890 --> 07:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
time do not receive any incidents of
 
07:40:06.468 --> 07:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
um restraints our seclusions in schools
 
07:40:07.910 --> 07:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
specifically and that would be another
 
07:40:10.250 --> 07:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
area where we would have the ability to
 
07:40:11.868 --> 07:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
oversee and if we did receive that data
 
07:40:14.150 --> 07:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
we would have a great uptick because we
 
07:40:15.048 --> 07:40:15.058 align:start position:0%
do understand there are a lot of
 
07:40:16.548 --> 07:40:16.558 align:start position:0%
restraints and seclusions happening in
 
07:40:20.390 --> 07:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
schools across the state okay and uh on
 
07:40:20.400 --> 07:40:21.350 align:start position:0%
schools across the state okay and uh on
your

07:40:21.350 --> 07:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
your
 
07:40:23.090 --> 07:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
we mentioned when you illustrate the
 
07:40:26.690 --> 07:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
current budget budget requests the 810
 
07:40:29.090 --> 07:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
966 figure that does not include the
 
07:40:30.770 --> 07:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs is that
 
07:40:30.780 --> 07:40:32.750 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs is that
correct

07:40:32.750 --> 07:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
07:40:35.868 --> 07:40:35.878 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct okay
 
07:40:37.968 --> 07:40:37.978 align:start position:0%
that's just that's your that would be
 
07:40:39.410 --> 07:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
your operating budget for or your
 
07:40:41.930 --> 07:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget for correct now that
 
07:40:43.250 --> 07:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
is what the efficiency budget would look
 
07:40:45.590 --> 07:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
like yes separate from um the final
 
07:40:47.510 --> 07:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
amounts of the prioritized budget are on
 
07:40:55.070 --> 07:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:55.080 --> 07:40:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
hi

07:40:56.270 --> 07:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
hi
 
07:40:56.280 --> 07:40:57.530 align:start position:0%
hi
um

07:40:57.530 --> 07:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:40:59.990 --> 07:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
you have so I'm thinking about the
 
07:41:02.390 --> 07:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
incident reports and to what extent are
 
07:41:03.890 --> 07:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
people reporting to you or people
 
07:41:07.250 --> 07:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
reporting to HHS at some point so we are
 
07:41:09.170 --> 07:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
to receive the same reporting that HHS
 
07:41:10.968 --> 07:41:10.978 align:start position:0%
receives so they are there are reports
 
07:41:12.468 --> 07:41:12.478 align:start position:0%
that are generated and sent to them and
 
07:41:14.330 --> 07:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
we are linked to their system to receive
 
07:41:15.770 --> 07:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
those reports
 
07:41:17.270 --> 07:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
um through an email chain so we do
 
07:41:19.570 --> 07:41:19.580 align:start position:0%
receive the same reports that HHS does
 
07:41:23.150 --> 07:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
we are working to ensure compliance
 
07:41:26.030 --> 07:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
internally so we do have regular
 
07:41:27.590 --> 07:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
meetings with them to talk about what
 
07:41:29.090 --> 07:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
they are receiving and ensuring that we
 
07:41:31.070 --> 07:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
have the same number of incident reports
 
07:41:33.170 --> 07:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
that we also have in our are able to
 
07:41:35.868 --> 07:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
review internally oh okay so this is in
 
07:41:39.170 --> 07:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
addition to this is it's this the
 
07:41:41.570 --> 07:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
the same report so to speak I mean in
 
07:41:44.270 --> 07:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
theory if the system works just so
 
07:41:47.628 --> 07:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
they also received 2508 reports correct
 
07:41:50.810 --> 07:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's helpful
 
07:41:53.690 --> 07:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
um my only other question is the
 
07:41:56.330 --> 07:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
the I forgot what it's called now even
 
07:41:57.410 --> 07:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
though I just testified special
 
07:41:59.510 --> 07:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
education Advocates yes
 
07:41:59.520 --> 07:42:00.830 align:start position:0%
education Advocates yes
um

07:42:00.830 --> 07:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:42:02.628 --> 07:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
and and I realize it's a different thing
 
07:42:05.390 --> 07:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
but to what extent is their overlap
 
07:42:06.890 --> 07:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
so I believe the overlap for the special
 
07:42:08.510 --> 07:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
education child advocate would be for
 
07:42:09.708 --> 07:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
the complaints that we are receiving
 
07:42:12.590 --> 07:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
from families in regards to concerns for
 
07:42:14.930 --> 07:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
their child's IEP not being met at this
 
07:42:17.868 --> 07:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
time we do field those calls and we
 
07:42:20.810 --> 07:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
refer them out to other agencies that
 
07:42:22.850 --> 07:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
can address their concerns because that
 
07:42:24.170 --> 07:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
is not the specialty within our office
 
07:42:26.208 --> 07:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
and with a change in mandate given the
 
07:42:28.610 --> 07:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
creation of the the new office that has
 
07:42:30.948 --> 07:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
shifted for us so we it would reduce
 
07:42:33.230 --> 07:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
some of our complaint calls
 
07:42:35.330 --> 07:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
um but the they would not necessarily
 
07:42:37.310 --> 07:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
have the overlapping view to look into
 
07:42:39.650 --> 07:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
the restraint and seclusion unless it
 
07:42:41.390 --> 07:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
was in some way related to the child's
 
07:42:43.310 --> 07:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
IEP where our view of the child is the
 
07:42:44.448 --> 07:42:44.458 align:start position:0%
holistic view of the child and would
 
07:42:46.430 --> 07:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
include a child in a general education
 
07:42:48.948 --> 07:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
classroom that may be restrained or
 
07:42:50.570 --> 07:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
you're struggling in some way that we
 
07:42:52.788 --> 07:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
would be taking a look at what their
 
07:42:54.170 --> 07:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
behavioral outcomes are and what the
 
07:42:55.430 --> 07:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
behavior management plan of the school
 
07:42:55.440 --> 07:42:56.510 align:start position:0%
behavior management plan of the school
is

07:42:56.510 --> 07:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:43:00.230 --> 07:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
to where do you refer those calls today
 
07:43:01.610 --> 07:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of them refer to the parent
 
07:43:02.930 --> 07:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
information center
 
07:43:05.690 --> 07:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
um some of some we refer to Legal Aid
 
07:43:05.700 --> 07:43:08.030 align:start position:0%
um some of some we refer to Legal Aid
Services

07:43:08.030 --> 07:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
Services
 
07:43:09.650 --> 07:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
um and some of the families we are just
 
07:43:11.330 --> 07:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
educating on the process of special
 
07:43:12.590 --> 07:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
education sending them back to the
 
07:43:14.510 --> 07:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
school district
 
07:43:16.610 --> 07:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
those are probably
 
07:43:18.830 --> 07:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
pick is better than referring them back
 
07:43:20.628 --> 07:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
to them yes Sam
 
07:43:23.410 --> 07:43:23.420 align:start position:0%
good okay thank you I'm yeah I'm done
 
07:43:28.150 --> 07:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:31.070 --> 07:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
okay next and and final for today on the
 
07:43:32.448 --> 07:43:32.458 align:start position:0%
agenda is a New Hampshire State
 
07:43:34.850 --> 07:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
commission for the Aging my
 
07:43:38.448 --> 07:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
understanding as of this morning is that
 
07:43:41.448 --> 07:43:41.458 align:start position:0%
the person who would testify as the
 
07:43:45.170 --> 07:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
tested positive for a virus of some sort
 
07:43:47.288 --> 07:43:47.298 align:start position:0%
which I won't name
 
07:43:49.850 --> 07:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
and uh has decided that it would be in
 
07:43:51.170 --> 07:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
our best interest for her to send
 
07:43:53.570 --> 07:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
written testimony and not to come into
 
07:43:55.850 --> 07:43:55.860 align:start position:0%
the office I can present her written
 
07:43:57.530 --> 07:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
testimony but I don't think I need to
 
07:43:59.150 --> 07:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
and we could take it as read you know
 
07:44:02.208 --> 07:44:02.218 align:start position:0%
submit the written testimony yes and we
 
07:44:04.270 --> 07:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
will read it very good
 
07:44:08.690 --> 07:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
great uh thank you everyone who uh
 
07:44:10.628 --> 07:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
testified today thank you for all the
 
07:44:13.730 --> 07:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
people on the on the committee here who
 
07:44:17.330 --> 07:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh to help me out and put all this
 
07:44:20.208 --> 07:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
together and we will adjourn for today
 
07:44:24.170 --> 07:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
and reconvene tomorrow at 8 30.
 
07:44:26.868 --> 07:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
I believe it is
 
07:44:28.730 --> 07:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
let's presume that's
 
07:44:30.708 --> 07:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
okay Michelle is nodding it must be true
 
07:44:30.718 --> 07:44:33.890 align:start position:0%
okay Michelle is nodding it must be true
yeah

07:44:33.890 --> 07:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
