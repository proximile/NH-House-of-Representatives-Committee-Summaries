00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
and we will move through our docket uh
 
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
in the order that bills have been put
 
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
forward and the first bill is HB
 
00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 align:start position:0%
1218 I happen to be the prime sponsor of
 
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
that bill so I will set aside and go to
 
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
the testifying table and uh represent
 
00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
cordelli will continue this uh this
 
00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Mr chairman and it's
 
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
kind of weird looking at this Maze of
 
00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
tables and chairs in front of us for the
 
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
record my name is Rick lad I come from
 
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
hail H New
 
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I also am uh the
 
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative of our speaker as a
 
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
trustee uh in the University system New
 
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today to introduce uh
 
00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
HB 1218
 
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is a bill that deals with the
 
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
merger of Granite State College into the
 
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
University New
 
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh during the first part of
 
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
year we had a lot of discussion on this
 
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
committee regarding the merger of the
 
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
community college system and the
 
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
university system New
 
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a number of issues were
 
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
brought forward at that time by folks
 
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
from both both uh the associates degree
 
00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 align:start position:0%
level the uh the seven community
 
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
colleges and the university system with
 
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
at that time the four uh uh locations
 
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
actually we have more locations with
 
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester and
 
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
Conquer but there are some existential
 
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
threats facing higher education today we
 
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
have a shrinking enrollment not just in
 
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but New England and the
 
00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
country and postsecondary education
 
00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
chasing the same students not just in
 
00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 align:start position:0%
our of all institutions throughout this
 
00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 align:start position:0%
country in New England are chasing the
 
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
same demographic that is
 
00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 align:start position:0%
shrinking just in the state of New
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alone in 2003 we had a student
 
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
population K through 12 of 28,000
 
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
students in
 
00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 align:start position:0%
2021 it shrunk to 169,000 students a
 
00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 align:start position:0%
loss of 39,000 students you can see the
 
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
implications we have when that comes to
 
00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
uh students preparing to leave high
 
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
school and go on to the postsecondary
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
level we also see within both uh systems
 
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
you University system the community
 
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
college system Capital costs are
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
increasing new renovation maintenance
 
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
projects um and replacement of some of
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
that uh Capital cost are huge and the
 
00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
operational expenses vers the revenues
 
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
are at margin at best it's extremely
 
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
tight margin and we need to be looking
 
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
at the whole system how we operate our
 
00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
postsecondary system we have campuses
 
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 align:start position:0%
that have overbuilt in many cases for a
 
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
population that no longer exists labor
 
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
and benefits is
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
increasing and we have many uni unique
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
student needs which need to be addressed
 
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
in light of the workforce needs in our
 
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.590 align:start position:0%
in light of the workforce needs in our
state

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
today the successes that these two
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
systems have are are a large number they
 
00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 align:start position:0%
have been working closely the
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
chancellors have worked closely to merge
 
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
and try to look at efficiencies in terms
 
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
of purchasing powers and terms of
 
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.029 align:start position:0%
of purchasing powers and terms of
operational

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
operational
 
00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
costs the M we they we have also tried
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
to maintain the unique missions of the
 
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.870 align:start position:0%
to maintain the unique missions of the
two

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
systems they are very different but but
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
they also have paralleling needs that
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
overlap and we got to be looking at that
 
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
the the systems to this point are very
 
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
Nimble and adapted to changing Workforce
 
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
needs we have done that the system
 
00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 align:start position:0%
chancellors as I said before have looked
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
at various curriculum agreements
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
accreditation process joint efficiencies
 
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
Etc we found on that subcommittee that
 
00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
we worked back in March 19 2021 we gave
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
a report to the finance division 2
 
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the concept of merging the two
 
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
systems together we saw issues
 
00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 align:start position:0%
associated with governance affordability
 
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
accessibility vision for postsecondary
 
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
institutional mission and vision heard
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
from we heard from Nei New England
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
Commission of higher
 
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
education we also have got involved from
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
the public uh higher public education
 
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
committee perspective the legislature
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
was involved
 
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
and we came out with some
 
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations from that subcommittee
 
00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
where go slow get this thing right to
 
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
achieve desired
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
results and work with the public higher
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
education study committee since then we
 
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
have looked at and the trustees have
 
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
looked at of the University system New
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how we can start this road
 
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
towards more efficiencies and merging
 
00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.510 align:start position:0%
towards more efficiencies and merging
our

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
systems the university system TR
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
trustees have looked looked Inward and
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
they see that there is tremendous
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
potential in combining our merging
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
Granite State College with UNH
 
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester there are some real true
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
benefits to that the bill
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
accomplishes um a comp uniting
 
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
complimentary mission statements the
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
online programs at at are are uh Keen
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
State Plymouth State Granite State and
 
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
UNH into one uh one system
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
um marketing potential for use uh for
 
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
Granite State really magnifies when we
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
put it on the umbrella of the University
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so with this this bill
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
we are proposing that the Granite State
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
College become a college within the
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
University of New
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the president of Granite State
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
College is now the chancellor of the
 
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
community college system New Hampshire
 
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
we have Jim Dean who is the president of
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire now
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
president of the college within the
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire Granite
 
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.909 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire Granite
State

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
college students currently in Granite
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
State College in un Manchester will be
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
able to complete their programs of
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
study as they are set up right
 
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 align:start position:0%
now but this whole proposal really
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
leverages the strengths and resources of
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
both campuses in support of all of the
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
four-year systems we have or colleges we

of New Hampshire system New Hampshire in
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
short we have taken this bill before the
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
public higher education committee had
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
unanimous support from them that's a
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
committee made up of senators and uh
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
Representatives that worked between the
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
community college system and University
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
system and understand the missions of
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
both so there's unanimous support there
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
there's un unanimous support from the
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
trustees to move in this
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
direction yes we are looking at more and
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
more uh options and efficiencies and
 
00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
paths to take this is the initial path
 
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that you support this
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill which will uh strengthen our
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%

forward to us this morning um just

always like to hear uh if you know um uh
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
what may have surfaced if there were any
 
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
uh risks identified by any of the
 
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
parties or any of the groups like the uh
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
public higher education study uh

terms of uh uh this merger and uh the um
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh the continuation of Granite State
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
College being able to continue
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
Mission thank you very much for the
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
question uh when this uh proposed
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
legislation was submitted to the public
 
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
higher education commission and I don't
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
know if Senator Ward's here or not she
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
chairs it I know representa umberger is
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
also on that and a number of us are uh
 
00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
yes there was there were there was
 
00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:26.670 align:start position:0%
yes there was there were there was
discussion

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
regarding missions and where we're going
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
with this entire process um that is of
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
course not really associated with this
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
particular Bill however there was
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
concern echoed by a number of folks that
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we preserve
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
the unique mission of the community
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
college system and the missions of the
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh four-year schools that we respect the
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
advancements and the pathways that have
 
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
been developed by the community college
 
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
ship uh system towards uh career
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
Pathways certification programs Etc in
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
those skill areas and that one system
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't start jumping in and saying well
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to get involved in this and
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
stepping on somebody else's Turf this is
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why mergers have to
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
occur we have to start looking at for
 
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
example the accomplishment that's just
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
been done with Plymouth State University
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
and White Mountain Community College
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
where a student that comes out when
 
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
associates degree from White Mountain
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
Community College will enter Plymouth
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
State University as a junior no question
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
you will enter as a
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
junior that will save a huge amount of
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
money in the part of our our students
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
that are having to pay and afford
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
College educations which is exorbitant
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
to begin with so there's a cost savings
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
there but it's also uh an efficiency
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
program where we have to start working
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
closely together I think that's the
 
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal here is for us to develop
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
a postsecondary system here in New
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that has these efficiencies
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
understands we have a shrinking
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
demographic and we have Capital cost
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
these campuses they're just climbing
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
beyond what we can really achieve in
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
some of the maintenance in these
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
buildings especially the community
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
college system we need to throw more
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance dollars at so uh there was
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
discussion on that representative luno
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
um uh I think that much that will come
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
out there in subsequent bills which we
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
have coming forward and in substance uh
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
discussion uh uh held by that public
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
committee you're welcome thank you very
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
much glad to hear that there was
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
consideration for that
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you uh representative
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
wck thank you Mr chairman I appreciate
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
it represent thank you for taking my
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
question one is a question be all right
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
a clarification as well so granted State
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
College would by understand what you're
 
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
saying would be
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
absorbed basically like a satellite or a
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
division in UNH that's my first question
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
it will be part of the UN University of
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester and underneath the umbrella
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
of unh now for further Clarity on that I
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
know that we have the chancellor for the
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
University system sitting behind me
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
Kathy uh proventure is here and there
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
will be folks that will be speaking on
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
this as well and perhaps and Woodcock
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
that might be a better question to
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
direct to the people that are directly
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
involved with it okay thank you follow
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you represent Celli just
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
just one for General edification um
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
currently the Plymouth if I understand
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
this correctly Plymouth and Keane uh are
 
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
independent Operator schools is there a
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
plan to have UNH as the umbrella in the
 
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
future take all these in see I I think
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a step that's down
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
the road
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
ways right now the those three schools
 
00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
that you talked about pet ke and UNH
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
separate body politic corporate body bch
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
so they report directly to the
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
trustees and they don't report to each
 
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
other um the moves the directions we got
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
to go in looking at higher education in
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
the state is that we got to get out of
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
the silo effect we got to get out of the
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
effect that each school is separate and
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
a separate corporate body politic and we
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
will decide what courses we accept what
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
we don't accept um if you look at the
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
Penn State system where there's over 20
 
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.870 align:start position:0%
Penn State system where there's over 20
uh

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
locations course 101 on the western side
 
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
of the core state is accepted on the
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
Eastern side of the state same course
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
and there's no no squabbling or fighting
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
between these various campuses um we're
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
going in that direction and we need to
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh so that's a good question and it's
 
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
one that needs more resolution and and
 
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
and and and insight in from the the the
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh presidents of the schools and the
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
folks working within it how we can
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
arrive at a point where that there is a
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
we can't compare the community college
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
system to the university system
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
Chancellor that the chancellor of the
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
community college system the president's
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%

the entire public higher ed study
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
committee in um thinking through this
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
this merger of granted State College
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
into the University of New
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um as you well know uh and as
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
representative lad has articulated
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
higher education especially in the
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
Northeast is facing some very
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
significant headwinds over the next 3 to
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
five years because of demographics
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
because of changing student demands and
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
um when the president of granted State
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
College Mark Rubenstein U took on their
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
role of Chancellor of the community
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
college system our board and our
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
presidents really took the opportunity
 
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
to think how could we think about this
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
differently in the future at every at
 
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:56.919 align:start position:0%
every turn we're we're we're trying to
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
think through that uh granted State
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
College and the University of Manchester
 
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
University of um New Hampshire and
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester have many similar
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
programs also granted state college has
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
the the infrastructure or the backbone
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
for online delivery the University of
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had some of that as well
 
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
so there was a duplication of effort
 
00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
there so the decision was made to come
 
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
forward with legislation to merge
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
granted State College into the
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:20:18.590 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
oh I'm
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
sorry so
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
um I will say I will say you know
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
another risk could be we want to make
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
sure we keep the community college
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
system very much informed because um
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
Granite State uh Granite State College
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
is a big receiver of community college
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
students so we are um I met with
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Rubenstein I think last week
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
or the week before we're making sure
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
that we keep the community college
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
system informed the community college
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
and university system we have a work a
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
working group that meets periodically on
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
a number of areas that we can
 
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
collaborate our next meeting is this
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon Dean Dell is going to brief
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
that whole group on um efforts in moving
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
moving in in this
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
direction um I would say uh another risk
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
is uh we don't act quickly enough on a
 
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
number of fronts understanding what is
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
in front of higher education in the
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
Northeast in the coming years
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
and what's always a risk is is culture
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
and we have to um make sure that we're
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
aware of that and and keep folks
 
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.789 align:start position:0%
aware of that and and keep folks
appropriately

00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
informed U we're we're committed to
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
preserving the name Granite State
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
College because it's important to the
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
alumni of granted State College and
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
we're also committed to
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
um ensuring that I mentioned this we're
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
mindful of the Open Access and
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable price point
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
for for our Granite Staters who attend
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
Granite State College um we were asked a
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
question when we are at public hire and
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
study committee we've included this in
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
the testimony um we do not anticipate
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
any forced layoffs because of this
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
merger and um with that um oh I also
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to um follow up on a question
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
from representative Woodcock there are
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
no plans being discussed right now to
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
have keen state or pus State absorbed
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
into the University of New Hampshire
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
we're trying to think how to get ahead
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
headwinds and in doing so ensure we keep
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
the mission and the uniqueness of keing
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
State College clou State University the
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire they are
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
important parts of the regions of our
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
state of the badok region in the North
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
Country there are lots of conversations
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
and plans um being developed in the
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire to
 
00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
share the resources across those
 
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
campuses but there are no plans
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
for I I'll use the word absorption or
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
Dean uh would you like to have the dean
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
speak next and then take questions or
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
would you like to take uh questions
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
Kathy I I'd like to give Dean Dell an
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity just to give you just an
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
overview of the work that's already
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
happening with Granite State College and
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
and UNH Manchester that's thank you then
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
please uh good morning and thanks for
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
inviting me here to uh talk with you all
 
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh this morning uh so um just by way of
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
background um I have been uh at UNH for
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
now almost uh six years have having uh
 
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
joined uh UNH from actually a long
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
career in the technology industry uh
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
including leading several uh small
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
private companies so I am very familiar
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
with the risks the opportunities
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
presented by uh mergers um like this um
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
I would characterize uh the work so far
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
as going extremely well we have a large
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
number of individuals from both Granite
 
00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:30.039 align:start position:0%
State College and un age engaged in what
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
is very very complex and detailed
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
planning efforts um these are in some
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
ways similar schools because as our
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
testimony uh indicates um we do um serve
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
in some sense uh many of the same types
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
of students especially in the greater
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester area but in other senses we
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
have uh very complimentary uh student
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
markets uh UNH Manchester has extensive
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
physical infrastructure that serves
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
students especially in the Sciences in
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
the engineering fields and so we are
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
bringing together schools that have
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
similarities but also in some cases uh
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
significant uh differences uh the two
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
institutions have different academic
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
calendars we have different admission
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
standards as uh uh Kathy indicated we
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
have different tuition price points and
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
it is so critical to preserve what is
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
good about each institution while
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the synergies that
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
bringing the two uh institutions
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
together uh can uh deliver um I do want
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
to talk about risk so for me the risks
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
that I think about are execution risk um
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
we have the same people planning this
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
merger as um are continuing to operate
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
their individual institutions so it's
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
very important that we not lose focus on
 
00:25:57.549 --> 00:25:57.559 align:start position:0%
the students we are currently serving in
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
the the way we are serving them as we
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
implement this merger and I think we're
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
taking very very careful steps uh to
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are not injuring
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
either School while we're implementing
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
what we believe is the best course for
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
the collective institution uh going
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
forward so I'm quite happy uh with the
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
work that we're doing we have already
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
taken steps on physical
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for example the 25 Hall
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
Street location which is graned State's
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
headquarters um is largely now leased
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
out um we occupy just now a small
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
fraction of that building having leased
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
the second and third floors to the New
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
Education um we have already taken steps
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
to consolidate certain uh courses and
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
programs into the UNH Manchester campus
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're already reaping merger benefits uh
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
the ones that are easy and
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
straightforward to reap but we have a
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
lot of work to do this is going to
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
consume the better part of the spring
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
semester uh but I'm very confident that
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
we're on a good track the cooperation
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
between the the the uh the communities
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
in both institutions is very very strong
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
and uh so far I I'm very encouraged by
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
see thank you very much uh are there
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
questions for the dean or for the
 
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.590 align:start position:0%
questions for the dean or for the
administrative

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
either way okay I just have a real
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
simple question you were talking about
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
keeping the name etc for the alumni and
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering upon
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
graduation what what will it actually
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
say will it have both colleges on I mean
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
will have the college and the University
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
or how does that work the bill um
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
provides that until July this is where
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
the work gets very complicated because
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
they accreditation we have notified the
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
um the accreditation body but until July
 
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.549 align:start position:0%
um the accreditation body but until July
of

00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
2023 degrees would say granted State
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
College assuming this is approved well
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
by the legislature and by the
 
00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:18.919 align:start position:0%
accreditors after July 1st of 2023 the
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
degree would say the University of New
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you can think of that
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
similarly to the University of New
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a college of Health and
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
Human Services and a colle of
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
engineering and all the diplomas say the
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire and the same
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
will hold to for Granite State College
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much repres sentive
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
Porter thank you Mr chair and that sort
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
of answers my question too I was going
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
to ask the same sort of thing it's been
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
many years since I was at the University
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts and amville when I was
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
there we had many colleges College of
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
Arts and Science College of Education
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
Etc um so the grand State College will
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
be like those colleges
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
as a under the university umbrella
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
correct no can I ask one more question
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay Kean and Plymouth do they
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
also have colleges underneath them as a
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
university now or is the definition of
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
university changed a bit keen and
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
Plymouth are both both undergone
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
reorganization over the last probably
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
three years um I do not believe pouth
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
and K have separate colleges the
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
university they I know at Plymouth their
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
programs are structured very differently
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
they have clusters of programs and um
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
Keen I believe has also very much um
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
restructured so there aren't as
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
many there aren't a number of colleges
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
in to AG my old understanding was a
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
university had many colleges underneath
 
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:53.799 align:start position:0%
it or a college was just separate of
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
itself but now many colleges have become
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
universities so that must have changed
 
00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.710 align:start position:0%
universities so that must have changed
am

00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
am
 
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
I so today uh the University of New
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at Manchester for example yeah
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
is one of seven colleges within UNH
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
there are five on the Durham campus
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
there's UNH Manchester and the school of
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
law is is the seventh College um we are
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
thinking hard about what the right um
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
use is of the Granite State College name
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
in future marketing efforts one of the
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh goals that we have in this
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's not just a matter of cost savings
 
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
although it is it is also a matter of
 
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
taking steps to try and grow the market
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
for online learning here in New
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and hopefully broadly uh and
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
we do believe that uh UNH um has a
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
significantly stronger brand um both in
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
the state and regionally and so we're
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
thinking hard about the future use of
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
the granite state name it will be a a
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
division vision of
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
unh um but we are working to figure out
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
what the continued use of Granite State
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
as a external brand should be given our
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
ambition to to be a bigger player in the
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
online uh student learning Market
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
followup just realized I have one more
 
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so how will
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
it work then if I'm a student and I'm
 
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
interested in um the courses that are
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
under the College of the grand the state
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
college will I be applying to the
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
University of manchest University of New
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at Manchester or will I be
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
applying to Grant State College you will
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
be applying to
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
UNH so today if you are a student at UNH
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester you apply to UNH and you make
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
an indication as to whether you are
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
interested in the main campus in Durham
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
the M the campus in Manchester or have a
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
equal interest in both and so we will
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
have a a provision like that but Our
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
intention is to put U UNH front and
 
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
center but maintain all of the same
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
admissions processes for those students
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
who prefer to attend UNH in an entirely
 
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.909 align:start position:0%
who prefer to attend UNH in an entirely
online

00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
mode and and so will if I have a twin
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
sister who wants to apply as well and
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
wants to take the same course kinds of
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
course but not at graned state College
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
rather at
 
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
University will she be charged more for
 
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
that course if she would prefer a more
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
residential experience such as the one
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
you get uh and residential experiences
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
bring with them greater costs which then
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
result in Greater tuition because
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
Granite State is an entirely online
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
school we don't have those same
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
operating costs and that supports a much
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
lower tuition rate that explains it
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that EXP
 
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:00.039 align:start position:0%
thank you rep representative Woodcock
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I have two if I
 
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519 align:start position:0%
may the first one Mr you mentioned um
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
initially you said that you're going to
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
maintain uh the Open Access price point
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
and when you get back to it the second
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
time you said you're going to maintain
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
the Open Access and the price point so
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
my my question is uh as we move down to
 
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.830 align:start position:0%
my my question is uh as we move down to
the

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
2023 uh timetable uh and assuming this
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
merges rolled into the university system
 
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
is the admission Open emmission Access
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
still going to apply at that point in
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
time yes okay thank you and I have one
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
more if I may Mr thank you for and I
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
could clarify just the motive for that
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
because I think that's
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
important the a significant number of
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
Granite State students are what we call
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
degree completers right they have a
 
00:33:53.629 --> 00:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
range of academic experiences at a
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
number of schools and uh they've proven
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
themselves as good students having
 
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
earned credits at a range of
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
Institutions at their stage in life the
 
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
average age is 33 your SAT scores don't
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
matter that much your high school GPA
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter that much it's
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
what you've done you know since then
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
that matters and so online schools tend
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
to be what we call open admission
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
because the standards that you would
 
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
apply to an incoming 18yearold really
 
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
don't apply to this type of learner
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
and so uh that's why we you know most
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
online schools are considered open
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
admission thank thank you you have one
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
followup yes sir go ahead thank you Mr
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
chairman just general followup uh at the
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
20 from now until 2023 and after the
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
2023 merger uh datee uh is it what is
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
the intention for the leadership of
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
Grant State that's currently in in
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
sitting yeah so
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
um at the time of of the announcement uh
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Rubenstein of course left for
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
the community college system uh the
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
other significant uh leadership position
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
was Scott Stanley in the role of provost
 
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
um that position has been eliminated and
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
Scott has actually joined UNH to lead
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
the University's overall online
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure platform given his
 
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
significant experience at Granite State
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
it made sense to try and take those
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
learning that Scott had um and apply
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
that to UNH more broadly as well as
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately to the university
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
system um and so uh at this point there
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
are two or three other leadership
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
positions that are continuing to operate
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
Granite State College but we will have
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately a new organization that
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
results from the merger planning uh that
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
I fully anticipate will include those
 
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
current leaders but perhaps in different
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
roles thank you thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
mofin yes thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you for
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
being here uh my understanding of
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
mergers generally has to do with the
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
intent or the goal of of streamlining
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
and and increasing efficiencies and and
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
removing duplication and that type of
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
thing and you earlier said that you
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate any uh staff reductions
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
or layoffs um but in response to an
 
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
earlier question about admissions uh you
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
explained that the admissions
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
applications would now go to UNH so the
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
the question I maybe others have is uh
 
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
is there redundancy in admissions or in
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
burer office or
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
regist uh and trying to understand why
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
this merger would not result in any uh
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
more efficient use of
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
personnel thanks for the question
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative moett um to be clear um
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
it likely will result in a reduction of
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
personnel what I said is why don't
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
believe we don't believe there are going
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
layoffs because we already have lots of
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
vacant positions and rather than fill
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
those positions we're reexamining all
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
the vacan I I'll give you an example the
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
president of granted State
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
College president Dean has been named by
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
the board to be the president of granted
 
00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.589 align:start position:0%
the board to be the president of granted
State

00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:27.790 align:start position:0%
State
College

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
College
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
you assume if this uh goes forward and
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
the accreditation works the president of
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
Grant State College will be the
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
president of
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
unh um on the topic of bursars and
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
admissions those conversation some of
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
those conversations are happening across
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
the university system where can we
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
leverage scale um so we do believe it's
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
going to result in cost savings and and
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
staff reductions but
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
nutrition and
 
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
rethinking various
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
jobs okay thank you in a quick followup
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
sure uh Sports um so folks who apply to
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
the GSC component um who are full-time
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
students would they be eligible to
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
participate on any UNH athletic
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
teams um so I am not a expert in
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
NCAA um eligibility uh uh considerations
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
but I do believe that if students are a
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh student enrolled at the University of
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and meet the eligibility
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
requirements of other un students uh
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
they would likely be be
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
eligible but they have to meet those
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements as un students
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
um it's it's important to note that um
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of GSC students
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually attend part-time uh not
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
full-time by our typical
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
definitions um and they take a much
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
longer time to complete their degrees
 
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
those are things we'd like to obviously
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
always accelerate but the reality is
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
most students are parents working
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
professionals taking their classes
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
part-time and so Athletics is not a big
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
priority for them but I could imagine
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
that there might be some limited cases
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
where That Could That Could Happen sure
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there further
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
questions represent LE us and then
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
represent Hopson yeah so if a student is
 
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
um Granite State and yeah they're their
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
expenses I mean their costs are reduced
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
because it's online Etc if they then
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
decide that they want to take a
 
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
particular class at UNH would would
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
those classes that they take at UNH
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
proper that would be in person would
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
those then cost the same as the UN at as
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
the other students taking those inperson
 
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
classes is that the way it's it's a
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
great question so first of all we
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
imagine that that will be the exception
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
not the rule that in those cases where a
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
student might want to take a
 
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
face-to-face class at UNH Manchester
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
because it fits their interests and
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
their needs uh that would be offered at
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
the granite state
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
at the granite state rate wow such a
 
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
deal yeah representa
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
Hobson but but the same is true that if
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
you're a UNH and we think this is
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
actually much more likely if you're a
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
UNH Manchester student and you want to
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
take happen to want to take an online
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
course and say uh the liberal arts and
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
it works better for your schedule to
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
take that online you would continue to
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
out thank you for taking my question Mr
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
questions uh and for being here today um
 
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
my question is is involving the fiscal
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
note um the cost seems to be uh ex
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
indeterminable so I was wondering if you
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
could tell me what types of costs you're
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
looking at and
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
considering the um we do believe there's
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
going to uh be a an upfront investment
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
necessary um that the university and the
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
university system will absorb the the
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
investment could be for in all
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
likelihood would be for technology so
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
for example right now granted State
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
College and the University of Manchester
 
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh the University of New Hampshire um
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
are on two different student Information
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
Systems so we need to make an investment
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those um
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
systems can talk to one another um the
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
so primarily in the way of of technology
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
I think the generally when we do a
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal note we're asked to determine
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
what the impact will be on the state we
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
don't believe there will be any impact
 
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
on the state's budget other costs that
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
we may the other thing I would say when
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
we did this fiscal
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
note uh they
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely are in in some in some ways
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
continue to be indeterminable because
 
00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
we're still in a planning
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
stage um there was there another bucket
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
that we had talked about that we might
 
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
need to make an investment to to move
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
this forward yeah I would say it falls
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
into two categories one is the migration
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
of information systems and that is by
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
far the largest single cost that we
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
expect is the because in some cases
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
granite state uses completely different
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
Information Systems in other cases it
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
uses a separate instance of that system
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore then the databases need to
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
be merged that can be complex and
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
expensive work and so that is that is a
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
big part of the transition costs the
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
other one is uh the launch of marketing
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
efforts to basically let students know
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
that things have
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
changed and and reinforce that univers
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
Branton state is now part of the
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire so we
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
imagine a marketing campaign that will
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
make that clear again we not only want
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
to preserve the student markets that we
 
00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
have we want to use this merger to
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
propel greater growth and so we think it
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
is going to be money well spent to
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
invest in a marketing campaign that
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
communicates what we're doing to the
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
public thank you very
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
much are there further questions of per
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
me represent Nelson thank you for taking
 
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.589 align:start position:0%
me represent Nelson thank you for taking
this

00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
question will the UNH professors ad
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
ation look as if a gron state
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
college class is equal or will it be one
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
looking down well if you want this we
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
give a little more higher priority to un
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
you guys are only from college yeah so
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
um so both Granite State College and UNH
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
are fully accredited by the same
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
accrediting body Nei um and we imagine
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
that in the post merger environment Nei
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
will be the common a creditor for all of
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
you in h including Granite State College
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
so a four credit course at Granite State
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
will be as equally regarded as a four
 
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
credit course from UNH classic if you'll
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
allow me that
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
phrase um and so in terms of degree
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
completion uh transcripting it will all
 
00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:50.270 align:start position:0%
completion uh transcripting it will all
be

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.150 align:start position:0%
be
considered

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
co-equal thank you very much
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
um so with that uh we have a an
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to take a short break
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh just uh for um a a better
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
understanding of where we are in this
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
particular bill um we're trying to get
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
uh our bills done and out of this
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
committee as quickly as possible is
 
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
there anybody here on a commune that
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
needs further information or
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of this merger with the
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
community college system excuse me with
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%
the Granite State
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
College and the um in UNH Manchester UNH
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
it would be a college just like the
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
Agricultural and Life Sciences College
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
is already within
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
UNH um if there's not any objection to
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we could take a motion to exec this
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
bill and get moving with it get it out
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
and um I think that that would be in
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
support of our public higher education
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
study committee and also really send the
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
signal to the trustees that we
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate their work and look forward
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
process represent bow did you have your
 
00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.230 align:start position:0%
process represent bow did you have your
hand

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
up bad signal okay um if there's not I
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
will entertain a motion to um motion for

explanation about the um the um the uh
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
the challenges and operations that would
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
go into uh having such a successful
 
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:52.839 align:start position:0%
merger um uh just a just a quick
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
background I've also had the benefit of
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh working um fairly closely with uh
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
with Dean Dell over the last six years
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
at UNH Manchester with the engineering
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
technology programs there and um and uh
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
I do have tremendous confidence in
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
Mike's um operational and
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
administrational um uh ability and

00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
is yes that's right yep good good point
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think they gave them to me but
 
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh well we always want to start with the
 
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
vi chair and then go and then she
 
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
first well white sh always VES first and
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
then and then yeah just go through the
 
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
GOP side and then the the ranking member
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
on the other side votes first for them
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
so after we VI sh course the shair votes
 
00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
Democrat well because she Democrat
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
Republican Democrat Republican so we
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
can't really go through this particular
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
list because in that way
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
because she she really her name should
 
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:43.870 align:start position:0%
 
think

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
together to generate a conversation
 
00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
about some very significant issues uh
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
that have to do with uh access to
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%
education at present there are a number
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
of um efforts being made in various
 
00:57:05.029 --> 00:57:05.039 align:start position:0%
quarters the business and education uh
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
committees uh that are trying to produce
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
programs they're funding them that get
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
students either in high school or into
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
community colleges and possibly into
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
universities uh to follow or get
 
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
preparation for and then follow follow
 
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
into the education for a career Sunday's
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
newspaper uh the Sunday uh Union
 
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
Leader had an article about Preparing
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
People for careers that continue to
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
advance the economy and their own
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
personal interest and that's exactly
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
what the overall intent of this bill is
 
00:57:52.109 --> 00:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
meant to generate a discussion of it
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
basically even though it says authorize
 
00:57:55.559 --> 00:57:57.190 align:start position:0%
basically even though it says authorize
the

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
um community colleges to award degrees
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's to get to the barrier crossings
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
that we need to address now rather than
 
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
when the mission assignments were made
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
back in when the community colleges were
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
formed and so this bill is meant to
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
generate a discussion that was my intent
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
to broaden the issue of exactly what was
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
being discussed just a few moments ago
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
about joining institutions merging
 
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
having gone through the merger of the
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
University of Massachusetts at L myself
 
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
being one of the people involved Tristan
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
and enthusiasm valuate the need let us
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
figure out the options for media let us
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
pick the best path that makes sense as
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
consensus among
 
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so in that regard I think
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
where 1530 has has headed where it's
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
likely to land is a sensible bill from
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
the community college systems
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you thank you very
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
much uh representative Bowman do you
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and take
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
the question can you explain the uh
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
community colleges bsrn system with the
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
because I believe that is now a
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
three-year system and then they go to un
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
so well depending on what what the
 
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
legislature does with the last bill that
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
you were discussing perhaps right now
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
the RN to BSN program is actually a 3
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
plus1 partnership with Granite State
 
00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
college students can complete three
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
years at the community college system
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
with the Community College systems lower
 
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
tuition rate and then take the fourth
 
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
year through Granite State College still
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
at the community college systems lower
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
tuition rate I think that's actually an
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
excellent model because in addition to
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
addressing the needs for students were
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
Place bound it also addresses the need
 
00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.109 align:start position:0%
Place bound it also addresses the need
for

00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
affordability thank you further
 
00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
Cornell thank you and thank you for
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question has the community
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
colge system had any discussions with
 
00:59:59.549 --> 00:59:59.559 align:start position:0%
the university system about how this
 
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
would work or if it's a good idea has
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
any of that kind of discussion going on
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
well only in in in general terms now the
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
illustration that's already been offered
 
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
about Plymouth state is one that grew
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
organically White Mountains Community
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
College recognized they had students
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
with that interest approach Plymouth
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
which has a significant presence in the
 
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
North country as the most logical
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
partner and Plymouth agreed to provide a
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
faculty member to deliver the courses
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
needed to to allow to complete that
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree program so on a caseby
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
Case basis that would emerge there there
 
01:00:33.309 --> 01:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
has been ongoing work to try and figure
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
out how to help students maximize their
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment opportunities the community
 
01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
college system Pathways that allow
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
students to capitalize on the lower
 
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
tuition rate the community college
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
system for as long as they possibly can
 
01:00:46.589 --> 01:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
before transitioning to what are
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
essentially more expensive options with
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
University system which would require
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
relocation so on a caseby Case basis
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
those conversations are all the time but
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
not necessarily in a systematic way
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
you Chancellor for taking my question
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to follow up on represent
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
Cornell's thinking um in the example you
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
gave us said the fouth state college
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
staff or faculty came down to Berlin to
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
actually do the PSU program that is that
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
correct just just to get geography
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
correct they'd have to come come out
 
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
okay oh I'm on the other side of the
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
mountain unless you're in Pittsburgh
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
you're not coming down okay okay well
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um now clarifying the
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
geography my intent however was to see
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
so it's not that program sounds to me
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
different than representative Ford's
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
initial thinking of as I read it as
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
Unity colleges offering b or BSS this
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
this was strictly a pum State program
 
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
coming down to burlin to satisfy the
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
Berlin people they had a demographic of
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
numbers and ROM was so that and that
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
plan that's different than creating
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
backlar programs at that level it's just
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
like a different site change I'm
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
thinking so is that is that am I
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
understand that correctly you have that
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
exact exactly right
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
repres what I would tell you is that for
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
us to offer the additional courses
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
required for a bachelor's degree would
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
require additional faculty deliver those
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
steps for accreditation that would add
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
expense so to the extent that prit
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
already has that capacity and is able to
 
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
make a cost effective delivery of those
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
courses at our location it accomplishes
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
for us most of what what I think
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
represent for's objectives have been
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay but follow up thank you sir um but
 
01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
in essence so that's really not creating
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
Balor program the Community College
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's providing opportunity for Balor
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
programs through the current four col
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
assist exactly right okay thank you
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chancellor thank you
 
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
further questions the
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
chancellor this is an ageold issue
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's come for before the public higher
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
education study committee in in in this
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
body um five or six years ago and I can
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
remember several Senators that are well
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
known on that side of the wall who are
 
01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
very very oppositional to four-year
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
program starting at the community
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
college level that's kind of way up here
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
but now we're looking at all this
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
inuendo and and different ways of
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the getting a a student
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
through a four-year degree or a two-year
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
degree and working cooperatively and
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
collaboratively together uh between
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
institutions I think it's something that
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
really is worthy of our study and assess
 
01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
it and and then come back so that's why
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
I will uh put together a subcommittee
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
here um made up of uh probably three and
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
three or four and four uh folks that
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
really want to delve into this so thank
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
you very much Chancellor yes further if
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
I may representative one one additional
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
Point among the 50 states New
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's consistently in the top 10
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
for adults with bachelor's degrees
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
already in hand it's a very well
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
educated state in that regard as we look
 
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
at what the workforce needs over the
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
next 10 or 15 years what we see is a
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
greater need for uh certificate programs
 
01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
for Workforce focused programs very
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
specific areas of specialization which
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
has been much more Central to our
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
mission it's part of the reason why
 
01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're a little bit at least a
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
little bit reluctant to be pulled toward
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degrees when we think there's
 
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
so much work that needs to be done at
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
the front lines and this includes people
 
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
who already have bachelor's degrees who
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
for reasons of of personal circumstances
 
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
or or as their lives change make
 
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
decisions to move into other areas of
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity here in the state so
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
again we're not averse to these
 
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
conversations we think they're helpful
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
for ensuring the most efficient use of
 
01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
resources across the state but we also
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we don't lose track of
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
a mission that we think in the next 10
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
or 15 years is going to be very critical
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
for the needs of this state's Workforce
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Chancellor we get
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
that and it kind of Echoes the intent of
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
s sp44 which came before us last year
 
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
and so uh but had some issues uh um not
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
associated with where we want to get
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
going here so thank you very much for
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
your testimony today and is there
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
speak no show hands thank you very much
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
hearing and the next hearing starts at
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:56.789 align:start position:0%
 
11:30

01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
next uh bill will be HB 1575 starts at
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
11:30 that's relative to the W waiver of
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
tuition in the University system so we
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
will take a short uh break here and come
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:52.990 align:start position:0%

01:44:06.189 --> 01:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
committee now you push you got to get
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
red thank you chairman members of the
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
committee I'm here today for your
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
consideration HP
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
1575 if you recall uh two years ago we
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
did a great thing and we passed a bill
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
that allowed for tuition waivers for the
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
children of 100% disabled
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
veterans and part of our logic behind
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
was that the law currently allowed for
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
veterans who died in service for their
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
children to go tuition free and we found
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
that it was rather unfair that if
 
01:44:40.109 --> 01:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
someone managed to survive and they were
 
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
totally and permanently disabled and
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
still could not afford to put their
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
children through college that they
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
should be in effect penalized for having
 
01:44:50.669 --> 01:44:50.679 align:start position:0%
survived in the meantime a constituent
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention as much as we
 
01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
all looked at it and thought we covered
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
everything if a veteran dies all things
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
being equal in other words the child is
 
01:45:03.149 --> 01:45:03.159 align:start position:0%
eligible for all the criteria for the
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver but if the veteran dies
 
01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
before they get to College they lose the
 
01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
benefit and they're not able to go so
 
01:45:13.229 --> 01:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
what this does is a simple fix all it
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
says it adds one line to the bill that
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
as it exists that says that if the
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
veteran dies prior to the a student
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
being eligible to go and he dies while
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
he's a resident of New Hampshire the
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
child is
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
eligible and that is really the simple
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
down and dirty on that bill and with
 
01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:35.719 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:45:40.159 --> 01:45:41.709 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
committee

01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
members yes representative
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
Nelson what is the definition of
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
disabled I mean I know what IV Vision
 
01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
but I do know
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
how you use the
 
01:45:53.679 --> 01:45:55.310 align:start position:0%
how you use the
system

01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
um I agree and we we when we originally
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
passed this bill a year and a half ago
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
we really delved into that to make sure
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's 100% permanent and disabled uh
 
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
permanent disabled service connected
 
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
that means that you have gone through uh
 
01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
numerous exams by the Veterans
 
01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
Administration and they have determined
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
that you your disability is 100% And
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
that there's no chance of you getting
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
better um and and when you look at VA
 
01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
math to get to 100% it's very very very
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
difficult you can lose several Limbs and
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
still not be 100% disabled so it's a
 
01:46:38.109 --> 01:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
it's a rigorous process so while I agree
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
in every system there are people that
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
abuse it um the VA system is one of the
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
toughest to uh to be able to do such a
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
thing further
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
questions yes
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative for coming to speak to us
 
01:46:59.589 --> 01:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
today uh I don't expect an exact answer
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
to this question but I'm G to ask the
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
question anyhow do you have any sense at
 
01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
all about the numbers as far as how
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
many students this would generate into
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
the tuition waiver program thank you for
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
the question when we passed the original
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
bill um we did a lot of research uh
 
01:47:22.830 --> 01:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
combined with the with the university
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
and college systems and they determined
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
that it it it would not be because of
 
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
the strict limitations we put on it to
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
to become eligible for this there would
 
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
not be very many and um and I
 
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I can't give you a number
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but it would not
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
be be very many um the the criteria were
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
very strict as far as the U residency
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
requirement the age they age out at age
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
26 they're no longer eligible so you
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
can't have old older people coming back
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
and getting their doctorates or anything
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
like that we made it very very strict so
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
adding this line does all
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
because um they would have
 
01:48:04.990 --> 01:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
been eligible anyway it's just that the
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor died um so it should have no
 
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
impact on the what we already originally
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
Miller thank you representative and
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
01:48:25.149 --> 01:48:25.159 align:start position:0%
was wondering will this include the
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
community college system as
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
well yes it's supposed to include
 
01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
everything that the original Bill
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
included University and Community
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
College system it was pointed out to me
 
01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
um by a u a member of the community
 
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
college system um outside that the way
 
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
where it's placed in the bill it might
 
01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
not cover that so an amendment may be
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
required to make sure it covers
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
everybody that was eligible on the
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
original bill and I'll be looking at
 
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to work with any
 
01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
member of the committee that wants to
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
introduce such an amendment um if I may
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
I was just informed uh with regard to
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
the previous question they anticipate
 
01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
between 100 and 125 students per year
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
are eligible for this and that number as
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
we disengage from conflicts throughout
 
01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
the world should
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
shrink further questions
 
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Roy thank you for taking
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
the question I appreciate your work um
 
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
just for my own Clarity I've forgotten
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
does the student already have to be
 
01:49:25.599 --> 01:49:26.709 align:start position:0%
does the student already have to be
previously

01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
enrolled with this or can the the
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
veteran have passed and then the student
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
enrolled um the veteran can have passed
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then the student enrolled so long as
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
the student was
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
eligible um at the time the veteran
 
01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
passed in other words the the veteran
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
was a resident of New Hampshire the
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
student was everything fits together in
 
01:49:46.589 --> 01:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
the veteran past they can still go for
 
01:49:49.709 --> 01:49:49.719 align:start position:0%
example if a student is um you know in
 
01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
eighth grade gr and their father or
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
mother passes away they'd still be able
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
to take admin addes when they get
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
college aged thank you so much thank you
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for question repesent
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
Tanner uh thank you and thank you for
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this bill I think this is
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
really really important um I was
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
wondering with the number of 100 if that
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
includes the disabled and not just the
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
ones that you're uh trying to get in
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
under this bill under this tuition reg
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
uh that number represents the total
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
total that would be 100% permanent Tak
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
to go to college so 100 between 100
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
and 25 I don't anticipate this bill
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
should increase that because it's still
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
the original pool that we would be
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
pulling from great thank you further
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
Porter thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:50:41.069 --> 01:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
representative Greg um the manner of
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
death is not a consideration at
 
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
all no representative um and the reason
 
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
that a lot OFA lately I just want
 
01:50:54.669 --> 01:50:54.679 align:start position:0%
understood the reason that I didn't get
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
into the method of death or whether the
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
death was connected to their service or
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
not is because they had already passed
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
the hurdle to have their child be
 
01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
eligible anyway to tack that on would
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
almost be a post post humous punishment
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%

my name is Kevin Grady uh following a
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
25- year career in the Air Force I have
 
01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh been a resident of hookit now for the
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
last 23 years uh and today I'm here not
 
01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:01.719 align:start position:0%
speaking as myself I'm here speaking on
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of the 20 member organizations of
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
the state veterans advisory committee
 
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
and for those of you who are unfamiliar
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
with what we do we're actually chartered
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
by state RSI to speak for the veteran
 
01:52:15.069 --> 01:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
community in New Hampshire and one of
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
the things that we do each year is we
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
look at all of the bills that are coming
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
for Ward to be considered that we think
 
01:52:24.189 --> 01:52:24.199 align:start position:0%
have veteran impact and then we discuss
 
01:52:26.069 --> 01:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
those and we take a position on it and
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
then I come and tell you what our
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
position is we strongly supported the
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
original bill on this uh two years ago
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
and we unanimously also support this
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
bill too um if if we had a veteran who
 
01:52:42.910 --> 01:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
passed away on the money that that
 
01:52:44.430 --> 01:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
veteran was making it would have been
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
very difficult a permanent and totally
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
disabled veteran if their sole source of
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
income was the money from the VA
 
01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
no child of theirs would be able to
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
afford to go to school in New Hampshire
 
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
I mean that's just the bottom line and
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
so we thought the original legislation
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
was good and college would be out of the
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
question potentially for the children of
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
that veteran if that veteran would to
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
pass away either before they went to
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
school or while they were enrolled in
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
school so we do strongly support uh this
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
it was a unanimous decision when we took
 
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
the vote last week and subject to your
 
01:53:18.069 --> 01:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
questions that's all I wanted to tell
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
you this morning thank you any questions
 
01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
01:53:27.069 --> 01:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
Grady not seeing thank you very much
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
chairman represent balero you're
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%

01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:43.159 align:start position:0%

up the colonels we help them out there
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
be successful by the way all right but
 
01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
anyways uh representative alal s for the
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
rec rocket him County District 5 I uh
 
01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
support this bill 150% and the reason
 
01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
why I do is I believe this brings the uh
 
01:54:01.159 --> 01:54:02.149 align:start position:0%
why I do is I believe this brings the uh
New

01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh veteran Community or in
 
01:54:07.629 --> 01:54:07.639 align:start position:0%
line with the federal government and
 
01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
when I say in line with the federal
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
government meaning if you're 100%
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
disabled veteran there's money there uh
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
that the student gets that helps offset
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
for books and other expenses there that
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
the federal government gives to that
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
veteran U child so this here would
 
01:54:27.550 --> 01:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
definitely make a big difference uh on
 
01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
helping the children of those disabled
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
veterans that cannot work and it's a
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
win-win for the State of New Hampshire
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
on basically not leaving one behind and
 
01:54:39.149 --> 01:54:39.159 align:start position:0%

welcome good morning my name is Shannon
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
Reed I represent the community college
 
01:55:11.310 --> 01:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire and as H the
 
01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor noted the intent here I believe
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
was to include the community college
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
system in the expansion of this waiver
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
if the committee um opts to do that the
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
place that that would need to go is RSA
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
188f colon 15 Roman 1A subp paragraph a
 
01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
and I can repeat that if needed um and
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
it would simply be adding the same
 
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
language that is in bold in the bill as
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
introduced to that paragraph and we we
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
would certainly um be very happy to have
 
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%

01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
that okay we're let's see uh looks like
 
01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
we're at the point now where the bills
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
which we had set for the morning are
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
done we thought the second bill would go
 
01:58:23.709 --> 01:58:23.719 align:start position:0%
a little longer it didn't so we are done
 
01:58:23.719 --> 01:58:25.709 align:start position:0%
a little longer it didn't so we are done
until

01:58:25.709 --> 01:58:25.719 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:58:28.069 --> 01:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
1:00 and I want to bring it to
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's attention we are
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
streaming continue to be streaming even
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
when we're not acting on a bill the I
 
01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
understand the audio is shut down but we
 
01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
are still streaming still have the
 
01:58:44.109 --> 01:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
visual yeah make sure your mics are off
 
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.069 --> 01:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
politely I guess we're done let's take a
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.239 --> 03:02:12.550 align:start position:0%

hello thank you Mr chairman members of

the committee representative Tom lanzer
from

03:13:27.389 --> 03:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:30.150 --> 03:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
nasua come before you to today to
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
discuss hb1
 
03:13:35.070 --> 03:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
1574 relative to prohibiting the
 
03:13:36.950 --> 03:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
university system and Community College
 
03:13:39.150 --> 03:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
systems of New Hampshire from charging
 
03:13:41.750 --> 03:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
out ofate tuition to students voting in
 
03:13:43.510 --> 03:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:13:45.670 --> 03:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is unique in that we allow
 
03:13:48.190 --> 03:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
many students who live here nine plus
 
03:13:50.830 --> 03:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
months out of the year to vote and claim
 
03:13:53.150 --> 03:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
their University as their
 
03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
home while some may agree that this is
 
03:13:58.510 --> 03:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
an incorrect voting policy every United
 
03:14:00.389 --> 03:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
State citizen 18 and older has the right
 
03:14:02.990 --> 03:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
to vote in New
 
03:14:05.190 --> 03:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what this bill seeks to
 
03:14:07.309 --> 03:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
accomplish is to prevent the
 
03:14:09.269 --> 03:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
universities and Community College
 
03:14:11.550 --> 03:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
systems from charging out state tuition
 
03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
Should students be allowed to vote
 
03:14:16.870 --> 03:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
claiming their college system as
 
03:14:19.469 --> 03:14:19.479 align:start position:0%
residents if students are claiming our
 
03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
great state is this voting in our
 
03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
elections potentially working and paying
 
03:14:27.710 --> 03:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
taxes but still paying AB state tuition
 
03:14:29.030 --> 03:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
for their
 
03:14:32.110 --> 03:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
education that is not a just practice to
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:39.590 --> 03:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
state and thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:14:40.950 --> 03:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee for your
 
03:14:44.950 --> 03:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much are to uh take
 
03:14:47.550 --> 03:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
questions I will okay are there any
 
03:14:52.510 --> 03:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:55.830 --> 03:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee looks like you're off the hook
 
03:14:58.870 --> 03:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you again thank you very much do
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:11.389 --> 03:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:11.399 --> 03:15:18.429 align:start position:0%
 
Horgan

03:15:18.429 --> 03:15:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:19.990 --> 03:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair my name is
 
03:15:22.510 --> 03:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
represent Timothy Oregon from dord
 
03:15:24.349 --> 03:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
district 6 which is the towns of Durham
 
03:15:27.429 --> 03:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
and Madbury and um Durham is not
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
coincidentally the home of University of
 
03:15:31.429 --> 03:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we're also the next
 
03:15:33.030 --> 03:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
town over Newton is the home of Great
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
Bay Community College which is one of
 
03:15:36.910 --> 03:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
the L major community colleges in the
 
03:15:40.510 --> 03:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
community college system so I'm uh I'm
 
03:15:43.269 --> 03:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
opposed to this uh I'm opposed this bill
 
03:15:45.750 --> 03:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
even though I certainly think um
 
03:15:47.950 --> 03:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
students should vote um student voting
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
is a is a good idea colleges when you
 
03:15:53.389 --> 03:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
develop lifetime habits and voting is a
 
03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
good habit to get into so I think
 
03:15:56.990 --> 03:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
students uh should
 
03:15:58.910 --> 03:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
vote and
 
03:16:02.110 --> 03:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
um but this bill as written um would
 
03:16:04.550 --> 03:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
create uh would create Havoc as every
 
03:16:07.150 --> 03:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
so-called outof State student um which
 
03:16:09.389 --> 03:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
is sort of a misnomer but anyway every
 
03:16:11.950 --> 03:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
student who's living in another state
 
03:16:15.150 --> 03:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
before they came to uh UNH would
 
03:16:17.309 --> 03:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
probably would be probably tempted to
 
03:16:20.349 --> 03:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
register to vote rather than um voting
 
03:16:22.030 --> 03:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
wherever else they might also still have
 
03:16:24.510 --> 03:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
a uh a residence for the um because this
 
03:16:27.070 --> 03:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
is a huge at least the way the tuition
 
03:16:29.110 --> 03:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
is structured right now this is a huge
 
03:16:31.229 --> 03:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
um discount it's like I think it's
 
03:16:33.309 --> 03:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
something like an order of $155,000 a
 
03:16:36.150 --> 03:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
year and that's actually the legality
 
03:16:38.550 --> 03:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's questionable since it's actually
 
03:16:41.550 --> 03:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
illegal as well as a bad idea to pay
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
people to vote
 
03:16:44.550 --> 03:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
you're paying them a huge sum of money
 
03:16:46.790 --> 03:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
effectively and that's uh so I don't
 
03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
know if that's going to pass mustard
 
03:16:51.950 --> 03:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
with Federal uh Federal elections law um
 
03:16:54.110 --> 03:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
creates as I said it creates Financial
 
03:16:55.950 --> 03:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
chaos for the University because uh
 
03:16:57.429 --> 03:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
they'll have a hard time budgeting it
 
03:16:59.150 --> 03:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
also means
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
um we do have a few other Provisions
 
03:17:05.030 --> 03:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
about uh tuition but basically we've
 
03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
we've with except for a few uh
 
03:17:10.110 --> 03:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions about um allowing they
 
03:17:11.790 --> 03:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
allowing like uh establishing
 
03:17:13.830 --> 03:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship sh for for veterans and
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
first responder children of veterans and
 
03:17:17.309 --> 03:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
First Responders and a few other things
 
03:17:19.189 --> 03:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
we haven't really delved this much into
 
03:17:22.030 --> 03:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
the mechanics out of state universities
 
03:17:24.590 --> 03:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
and community colleges set their tuition
 
03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
and obviously they have to set tuition
 
03:17:28.870 --> 03:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
high enough to uh you know meet meet
 
03:17:31.229 --> 03:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
their budgets so what they're probably
 
03:17:33.429 --> 03:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
what they probably do is uh instead of
 
03:17:36.309 --> 03:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
charging so-called instate students you
 
03:17:37.550 --> 03:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
know half the tuition they'll probably
 
03:17:38.950 --> 03:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
just you know have to charge them the
 
03:17:41.590 --> 03:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
same tuition as uh so-called out ofate
 
03:17:44.030 --> 03:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
students and that's not I don't think
 
03:17:45.550 --> 03:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
there's anybody in the room who thinks
 
03:17:46.670 --> 03:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
03:17:50.349 --> 03:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
policy and um funny to get back I said
 
03:17:51.630 --> 03:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
that the term out of State student
 
03:17:56.510 --> 03:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
student is a misnomer um students
 
03:17:58.510 --> 03:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they lived you know
 
03:18:00.550 --> 03:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
before they came to UNH or any other
 
03:18:02.189 --> 03:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
community college or before they
 
03:18:04.750 --> 03:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
attended a community college um they are
 
03:18:06.189 --> 03:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
residents of the community where they
 
03:18:08.349 --> 03:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
are 9 months out of the year or many
 
03:18:10.110 --> 03:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
cases 12 months out of the year so they
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
are so all those students in the dorms
 
03:18:15.550 --> 03:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
and the off-campus housing unage they
 
03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
are residents of Durham they're counted
 
03:18:18.870 --> 03:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
as such in the
 
03:18:22.349 --> 03:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
census you know they're uh so really
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
legally there's not much distinction
 
03:18:26.550 --> 03:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
between out of state and instate um
 
03:18:28.349 --> 03:18:28.359 align:start position:0%
students really is any definition you
 
03:18:31.150 --> 03:18:31.160 align:start position:0%
can draw that uh a would make sense and
 
03:18:33.870 --> 03:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
B also wouldn't interfere with uh
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
certain Supreme Court decisions such as
 
03:18:37.750 --> 03:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
the I believe it's a Sims decision which
 
03:18:40.070 --> 03:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
was reached back in 1979 the same year I
 
03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
graduated from college um so
 
03:18:45.630 --> 03:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
and what the instate versus out ofate
 
03:18:48.030 --> 03:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
tuition uh thing is basically it's based
 
03:18:51.630 --> 03:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
on where your family and you know the
 
03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
student themselves so they usually young
 
03:18:54.750 --> 03:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
people they don't pay much taxes but
 
03:18:57.150 --> 03:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
where the families paying taxes
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
before the student enrolled the UN so
 
03:19:02.349 --> 03:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
it's based on uh your sort of
 
03:19:03.670 --> 03:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
essentially that's one of the things
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
you've been paying for with your taxes
 
03:19:07.830 --> 03:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
if you're families living in state is uh
 
03:19:09.189 --> 03:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know the possibility you might want
 
03:19:11.710 --> 03:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
to go to UNH on the instate tuition so
 
03:19:11.720 --> 03:19:12.710 align:start position:0%
to go to UNH on the instate tuition so
they

03:19:12.710 --> 03:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:19:13.990 --> 03:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's based on where they've been living
 
03:19:17.550 --> 03:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
and paying taxes beforehand and um
 
03:19:18.990 --> 03:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
finally one other point is this is
 
03:19:22.870 --> 03:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against students who
 
03:19:24.870 --> 03:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh can't
 
03:19:28.189 --> 03:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
vote say if they're foreign Nationals um
 
03:19:30.269 --> 03:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
say if they're under the age of 18 which
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
um you know many many freshmen are under
 
03:19:36.750 --> 03:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 or if they if they belong
 
03:19:39.670 --> 03:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
to a uh religion which forbids voting
 
03:19:41.830 --> 03:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
and actually I think one of the sponsors
 
03:19:43.030 --> 03:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
was brought up in a religion that
 
03:19:44.750 --> 03:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
actually forbids its members from voting
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
although he he left the church obviously
 
03:19:48.630 --> 03:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
because he's serving the legislature so
 
03:19:51.389 --> 03:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
or also even just people who don't want
 
03:19:52.830 --> 03:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
to vote because they don't really want
 
03:19:54.830 --> 03:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know maybe they have the bumper
 
03:19:57.429 --> 03:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
sticker on their car don't vote it only
 
03:19:59.269 --> 03:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
encourages them so there's like a large
 
03:20:01.189 --> 03:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
number of people so you know so
 
03:20:03.630 --> 03:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
discriminates against those students who
 
03:20:06.990 --> 03:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
either can't vote or choose for whatever
 
03:20:10.710 --> 03:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
reason not to vote so this is a this
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
bill has come up every year or two and
 
03:20:14.790 --> 03:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's always uh been ited and I hope
 
03:20:16.950 --> 03:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
you'll uh make the same recommendation
 
03:20:16.960 --> 03:20:18.349 align:start position:0%
you'll uh make the same recommendation
this

03:20:18.349 --> 03:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:20:20.590 --> 03:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much representative
 
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:26.349 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
representative

03:20:26.349 --> 03:20:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:30.070 --> 03:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
Horgan represent M thank you m shair
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you represent for taking my
 
03:20:33.990 --> 03:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
question um knowing that you're a
 
03:20:36.790 --> 03:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
veteran legislator from a college town
 
03:20:41.630 --> 03:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
yeah um do you know of any other state
 
03:20:43.830 --> 03:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
where an out of state out of State
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
student paying out of state tuition can
 
03:20:49.030 --> 03:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
same day register in an election and
 
03:20:51.150 --> 03:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
have that vote count that same day well
 
03:20:52.990 --> 03:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
that'll probably be a more question for
 
03:20:54.830 --> 03:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh someone from the Secretary of State's
 
03:20:57.469 --> 03:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
office there are um I believe certainly
 
03:21:01.389 --> 03:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
every other state treats uh so-called uh
 
03:21:03.189 --> 03:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
out of state students on the same
 
03:21:07.150 --> 03:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
footing as uh instate students I myself
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
went to two universities out of state
 
03:21:14.349 --> 03:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
and I um voted um I voted uh I voted uh
 
03:21:16.870 --> 03:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
in New York City for a while at when I
 
03:21:18.189 --> 03:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
was attending Columbia University and
 
03:21:20.110 --> 03:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
then in Los Angeles when I was attending
 
03:21:22.269 --> 03:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
University of Southern California and u
 
03:21:23.870 --> 03:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
c those are private institutions whole
 
03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
instate versus out of state tuition
 
03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
thing doesn't kick in you know they have
 
03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
the same tuition rate for everybody
 
03:21:32.189 --> 03:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
they're not State institutions but U
 
03:21:33.950 --> 03:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
I um
 
03:21:36.910 --> 03:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the uh we are same day
 
03:21:39.830 --> 03:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
voter registration is um you know not
 
03:21:42.389 --> 03:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
every state has it um but
 
03:21:45.030 --> 03:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
I don't see any reason why somebody who
 
03:21:47.309 --> 03:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
moved to the state because they they're
 
03:21:47.319 --> 03:21:48.469 align:start position:0%
moved to the state because they they're
attending

03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
attending
 
03:21:50.910 --> 03:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
school um deserves to have fewer rights
 
03:21:52.590 --> 03:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
than somebody who moves there for
 
03:21:54.990 --> 03:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
whatever other reason I just also
 
03:21:56.550 --> 03:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
clarifies about veterans a lot I'm a
 
03:21:58.349 --> 03:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
veteran as in I've been through a lot of
 
03:22:01.150 --> 03:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
legislative terms I myself um am not a
 
03:22:02.910 --> 03:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
veteran of military service not the
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
closest I can come to was having been a
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh civilian employee of the Army Corps
 
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
of Engineers in Hanover which is a
 
03:22:12.030 --> 03:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
college town but that college too is
 
03:22:13.790 --> 03:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
also a private one
 
03:22:16.910 --> 03:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
so okay that's thank you I met
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
experienced legislator yes oh well
 
03:22:19.600 --> 03:22:20.469 align:start position:0%
experienced legislator yes oh well
that's

03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:22:23.229 --> 03:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
fine are there further questions
 
03:22:24.990 --> 03:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
represent LE
 
03:22:29.150 --> 03:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
us yeah I'm trying to figure out
 
03:22:29.160 --> 03:22:31.150 align:start position:0%
us yeah I'm trying to figure out
your

03:22:31.150 --> 03:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:22:35.870 --> 03:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
obje in that it would seem you want to
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
encourage students to V would this not
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
encourage students
 
03:22:47.590 --> 03:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
vot and um and the other half of that is
 
03:22:49.830 --> 03:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
cannot students
 
03:22:49.840 --> 03:22:51.790 align:start position:0%
cannot students
vote

03:22:51.790 --> 03:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
vote
 
03:22:55.950 --> 03:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
um absentee ballot from the wherever it
 
03:22:59.429 --> 03:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
was that came from even in college yes
 
03:23:02.510 --> 03:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
well I'm um I'm glad to see that the
 
03:23:05.790 --> 03:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
party that has a majority caucus in this
 
03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
body still supports absentee voting they
 
03:23:09.429 --> 03:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
weren't so enthusiastic about it last
 
03:23:11.309 --> 03:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
year when record number of absentee
 
03:23:16.030 --> 03:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
votes cast um they may um the student
 
03:23:18.309 --> 03:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
they may be more interested in the uh
 
03:23:19.870 --> 03:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
what's going on in New Hampshire than in
 
03:23:21.950 --> 03:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
their old home state they also they're
 
03:23:24.510 --> 03:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
not always necessarily always eligible
 
03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
to vote in some other state um and then
 
03:23:30.870 --> 03:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
absentee absentee voting is uh it's not
 
03:23:33.750 --> 03:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
quite as easy it's I mean it's it's not
 
03:23:36.950 --> 03:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult but it's uh not not
 
03:23:39.030 --> 03:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
as trivial as uh you know some make it
 
03:23:42.269 --> 03:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
out to be and it's uh frankly um
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
there seems to be at least some some
 
03:23:46.349 --> 03:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
people here here in the New Hampshire
 
03:23:47.630 --> 03:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
house and other legislative bodies who
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
want to make it more difficult so they
 
03:23:49.439 --> 03:23:50.990 align:start position:0%
want to make it more difficult so they
not

03:23:50.990 --> 03:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:23:54.269 --> 03:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
um so it should be up to the they they
 
03:23:55.469 --> 03:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
should have the same rights as anybody
 
03:23:57.189 --> 03:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
else who has multiple residents you know
 
03:23:59.790 --> 03:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
there's lots of you know it's being a
 
03:24:01.110 --> 03:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
student is no different say being
 
03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who spends a lot of months at a
 
03:24:04.550 --> 03:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
vacation home in Florida or whatever so
 
03:24:05.830 --> 03:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
they they have the same legal rights as
 
03:24:08.990 --> 03:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else so they um and as for
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
encouraging students to vote that's fine
 
03:24:13.870 --> 03:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
but a 15,000 a year payment you know it
 
03:24:16.150 --> 03:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
could be $60,000 or more over the course
 
03:24:18.990 --> 03:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
of a degree program that's it's illegal
 
03:24:20.710 --> 03:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
and that's also grossly excessive you
 
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
know so it's it's people should people
 
03:24:24.910 --> 03:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
should vote because they they want to
 
03:24:28.030 --> 03:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
vote not because somebody's paying
 
03:24:32.110 --> 03:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much further
 
03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:53.830 --> 03:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:56.710 --> 03:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
blanger thank you Mr chairman members of
 
03:24:57.910 --> 03:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
the committee appreciate you hearing
 
03:25:00.030 --> 03:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
this uh testimony today appreciate
 
03:25:03.550 --> 03:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
everybody behind me being here as
 
03:25:05.910 --> 03:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
well this bill doesn't make it more
 
03:25:07.469 --> 03:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
difficult for college students it
 
03:25:09.389 --> 03:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
encourages them to attend University
 
03:25:11.070 --> 03:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire they
 
03:25:13.630 --> 03:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
also get discount it's not paying for
 
03:25:17.110 --> 03:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
students to vote that is that's absurd
 
03:25:19.750 --> 03:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do that this bill
 
03:25:22.349 --> 03:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
seeks to offer fairness to University
 
03:25:23.469 --> 03:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
students because if they're going to
 
03:25:25.150 --> 03:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
claim domicile in state of New Hampshire
 
03:25:27.030 --> 03:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
and they're going to vote in our
 
03:25:29.670 --> 03:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
elections why don't they get in state
 
03:25:31.269 --> 03:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
tuition that's the question that we're
 
03:25:34.590 --> 03:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
talking about okay so when I went to the
 
03:25:36.070 --> 03:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire and I was a
 
03:25:38.229 --> 03:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
social work major don't get me started
 
03:25:40.469 --> 03:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
on how I was treated as a republican
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
there I voted in my domicile which was
 
03:25:47.950 --> 03:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
eping and Brentwood New Hampshire okay
 
03:25:49.189 --> 03:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
two different times when I voted there
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
by the way I didn't vote in the same
 
03:25:52.750 --> 03:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
year two different polling locations
 
03:25:55.429 --> 03:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
just want to make that very
 
03:25:57.710 --> 03:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
clear um when I went to the University
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire part of my application
 
03:26:02.790 --> 03:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
process was that I had to say that I was
 
03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
a resident of New Hampshire and I don't
 
03:26:06.269 --> 03:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
remember the period of time I think it
 
03:26:08.469 --> 03:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
was either 12 months or or more than
 
03:26:12.030 --> 03:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
that but if uh
 
03:26:16.150 --> 03:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
if a student is voting in New Hampshire
 
03:26:18.030 --> 03:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
they have a right to instate tuition
 
03:26:19.150 --> 03:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
they're considering themselves a
 
03:26:21.150 --> 03:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
resident they are domiciled here and
 
03:26:22.910 --> 03:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill seeks to
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
do um from campuses that seek to offer
 
03:26:29.309 --> 03:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
fairness to all
 
03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
students doesn't seem pretty fair that
 
03:26:33.590 --> 03:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to let them vote help them
 
03:26:36.750 --> 03:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
vote help them register to vote but then
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
also charge them out of state to it you
 
03:26:42.110 --> 03:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't really seem fair to me uh with
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
that uh I'd be happy to take any
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:53.030 --> 03:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative representa I have one
 
03:26:55.389 --> 03:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
question um looking at this from a
 
03:26:55.399 --> 03:26:57.110 align:start position:0%
question um looking at this from a
fiscal

03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
03:27:00.070 --> 03:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
perspective um if all students that
 
03:27:03.150 --> 03:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about opt become instate
 
03:27:03.160 --> 03:27:04.389 align:start position:0%
we're talking about opt become instate
tuition

03:27:04.389 --> 03:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
03:27:06.630 --> 03:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
students we're looking at a loss of
 
03:27:10.830 --> 03:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue of over $139 million potentially
 
03:27:13.670 --> 03:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
how will the state or how will the
 
03:27:13.680 --> 03:27:15.469 align:start position:0%
how will the state or how will the
university

03:27:15.469 --> 03:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
university
 
03:27:17.950 --> 03:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
system make that up do you have any idea
 
03:27:19.710 --> 03:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
how to do that perhaps they should cut
 
03:27:24.830 --> 03:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:26.830 --> 03:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
Administration thank
 
03:27:31.830 --> 03:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:33.510 --> 03:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
03:27:39.750 --> 03:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:42.229 --> 03:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
you uh the next person we have on the
 
03:27:44.750 --> 03:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
docket is Shannon Reed community college
 
03:27:53.710 --> 03:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:55.950 --> 03:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire good afternoon members of the
 
03:27:57.710 --> 03:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Shannon Reed I'm
 
03:27:59.469 --> 03:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the community college
 
03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire thank you for
 
03:28:03.030 --> 03:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify
 
03:28:06.110 --> 03:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
today um first I'd like to say that only
 
03:28:08.429 --> 03:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
about 6% of students at the community
 
03:28:12.030 --> 03:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
colleges are out of state tuition payers
 
03:28:14.990 --> 03:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
um in a given year between 93 and 96% of
 
03:28:16.990 --> 03:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
our students are New Hampshire residents
 
03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
we don't typically weigh in on bills
 
03:28:21.030 --> 03:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
that deal with voting and domicile
 
03:28:24.030 --> 03:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
because there's really no impact um to
 
03:28:26.070 --> 03:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
our our students or our institution
 
03:28:27.309 --> 03:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
that's not so much the case with with
 
03:28:28.990 --> 03:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
this bill necessarily but that impact is
 
03:28:30.990 --> 03:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
really only on the six% that don't pay
 
03:28:34.590 --> 03:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
in state tuition for purposes um of Our
 
03:28:37.269 --> 03:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
Testimony we assume that we would
 
03:28:41.389 --> 03:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
determine um residency and voting by
 
03:28:44.070 --> 03:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
basically matching a student database
 
03:28:45.870 --> 03:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
against the New Hampshire voter database
 
03:28:47.229 --> 03:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
that's maintained by the New Hampshire
 
03:28:49.269 --> 03:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and that somehow we
 
03:28:51.309 --> 03:28:51.319 align:start position:0%
could automate that process to
 
03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
streamline it and and minimize
 
03:28:53.760 --> 03:28:55.349 align:start position:0%
streamline it and and minimize
costs

03:28:55.349 --> 03:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:28:59.189 --> 03:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
um that said though um running those
 
03:29:02.070 --> 03:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
checks to cross check our student
 
03:29:04.469 --> 03:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
database against the voter database
 
03:29:06.229 --> 03:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
would have to take place very frequently
 
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the year as new cohorts of
 
03:29:12.429 --> 03:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
students register and pay tuition um um
 
03:29:16.030 --> 03:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
we would ccsnh has rolling admission
 
03:29:18.389 --> 03:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
registration and payment timetables and
 
03:29:20.070 --> 03:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
multiple times throughout the year when
 
03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
courses begin and students May enroll so
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
there would be a a significant amount of
 
03:29:27.590 --> 03:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
work associated with literally
 
03:29:30.229 --> 03:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
every um maybe monthly or every few
 
03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
weeks even running this check to see
 
03:29:34.229 --> 03:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
when our students have enrolled and
 
03:29:36.550 --> 03:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
registered and paid whether they were in
 
03:29:38.189 --> 03:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
fact registered to vote in New Hampshire
 
03:29:40.590 --> 03:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
or not but second would be the potential
 
03:29:42.870 --> 03:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
effect on tuition Revenue instate
 
03:29:45.389 --> 03:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
tuition is significantly lower than out
 
03:29:47.309 --> 03:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
of state tuition at the community
 
03:29:49.710 --> 03:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
colleges we would experience some
 
03:29:51.550 --> 03:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
decrease in Revenue that could result
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
from the mandate to reclassify residency
 
03:29:56.110 --> 03:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
for tuition purposes for any student who
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
registers to vote in New Hampshire based
 
03:30:00.070 --> 03:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
on the Secretary of State's guidelines
 
03:30:02.309 --> 03:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
for establishing domicile in the
 
03:30:05.070 --> 03:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
state um the we can't really calculate
 
03:30:06.429 --> 03:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
the decrease because we can't predict
 
03:30:08.030 --> 03:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
how many students would would make this
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
change if if zero% of our ad of State
 
03:30:13.710 --> 03:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
students um registered to vote in New
 
03:30:15.269 --> 03:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there thereby had to be
 
03:30:16.750 --> 03:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
reclassified then the impact would be
 
03:30:19.389 --> 03:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
zero if 100% of them did the impact on
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
our colleges would be just over a
 
03:30:22.550 --> 03:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars a
 
03:30:25.150 --> 03:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
year um the legislation may also require
 
03:30:27.070 --> 03:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
a statutory change authorizing the
 
03:30:28.830 --> 03:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
community colleges to have access to the
 
03:30:31.349 --> 03:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter database and we would we
 
03:30:33.110 --> 03:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
would look for guidance from the
 
03:30:34.750 --> 03:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office on how that
 
03:30:36.910 --> 03:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
would work and what if any costs would
 
03:30:36.920 --> 03:30:37.990 align:start position:0%
would work and what if any costs would
be

03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:30:40.189 --> 03:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
incurred um in closing I'd urge the
 
03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
committee to consider consider carefully
 
03:30:43.229 --> 03:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
whether it wants to create an incentive
 
03:30:44.710 --> 03:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
for non- New Hampshire students to
 
03:30:46.590 --> 03:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
register to vote in New Hampshire in
 
03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
order to be eligible for instate tuition
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
rates as as was stated before um a
 
03:30:55.550 --> 03:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
student who otherwise might not desire
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
to vote in New Hampshire could simply
 
03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
register to do so in order to get
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
instate tuition rights as opposed to the
 
03:31:02.269 --> 03:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
out of state costs which are more than
 
03:31:04.830 --> 03:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
double instate costs so that is my
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I I will submit it in writing
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any questions thank
 
03:31:12.870 --> 03:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
you very much represent leas
 
03:31:16.510 --> 03:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
yes when I went to Michigan State um the
 
03:31:18.990 --> 03:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
college didn't decide who got which once
 
03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
you were enrolled if you were a student
 
03:31:25.189 --> 03:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
and you wanted to be in state you
 
03:31:27.710 --> 03:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
applied and so you wouldn't have to do
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
any of that checking paperwork change
 
03:31:32.070 --> 03:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
laws anything it would be on the head of
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
the student to apply to for the
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
change thank you representative I
 
03:31:39.469 --> 03:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate the comment I think that we
 
03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
would feel an obligation to verif verify
 
03:31:43.670 --> 03:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
as we do currently for instate tuition
 
03:31:45.830 --> 03:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
rates we do verify when a student
 
03:31:48.670 --> 03:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
indicates that they are inate or
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
not are there further questions for
 
03:31:53.389 --> 03:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
Shannon Reed yes representative wood
 
03:31:54.590 --> 03:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
03:31:57.349 --> 03:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
L thank you for thinking a question um
 
03:32:00.110 --> 03:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
you indicated that about 6% the Comm
 
03:32:00.120 --> 03:32:01.510 align:start position:0%
you indicated that about 6% the Comm
call

03:32:01.510 --> 03:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
call
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
system out of you Happ to know your
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
professional affiliation what that
 
03:32:10.630 --> 03:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
number may be system I don't know but
 
03:32:12.990 --> 03:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that someone behind me who will
 
03:32:15.389 --> 03:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
testify subsequently could tell you that
 
03:32:18.750 --> 03:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
okay and I guess the second question um
 
03:32:20.830 --> 03:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
representative spoke before you
 
03:32:23.550 --> 03:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
indicated he thought1 139 million cost
 
03:32:25.309 --> 03:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
could be saved by cutting the
 
03:32:26.590 --> 03:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
administrative staff do you think that
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:32.990 --> 03:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
it thank you for that question
 
03:32:37.110 --> 03:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative um I I no I don't think
 
03:32:40.110 --> 03:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you Mr chairman are
 
03:32:41.670 --> 03:32:41.680 align:start position:0%

next okay we welcome Tom Cronin
 
03:33:02.229 --> 03:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:33:05.550 --> 03:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Tom Cronin
 
03:33:07.030 --> 03:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for the
 
03:33:08.990 --> 03:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
University system I do have written
 
03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
testimony that's uh being distributed
 
03:33:13.030 --> 03:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
now I think I'll keep my comments brief
 
03:33:17.070 --> 03:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
however um really it's two points um
 
03:33:19.590 --> 03:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
currently our Board of Trustees sets uh
 
03:33:21.950 --> 03:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
your ability to uh obtain instate
 
03:33:24.790 --> 03:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
tuition based really on two main factors
 
03:33:27.110 --> 03:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
one uh have you physically resided in
 
03:33:28.830 --> 03:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for 12 months
 
03:33:31.830 --> 03:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
or more and two are you doing so for
 
03:33:33.790 --> 03:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
some reason other than
 
03:33:36.389 --> 03:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
education okay so you can't really that
 
03:33:38.750 --> 03:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
second one is key you can't therefore be
 
03:33:41.950 --> 03:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
a freshman uh spends a year here and all
 
03:33:43.590 --> 03:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
of a sudden then gets inate tuition
 
03:33:45.469 --> 03:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
sophomore through senior year right
 
03:33:47.670 --> 03:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
those are the two key uh pieces of
 
03:33:49.349 --> 03:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
information we use right now I think as
 
03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative Oran said there are other
 
03:33:52.429 --> 03:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
waivers particularly related to the
 
03:33:54.870 --> 03:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
military Etc that change that in very
 
03:33:57.269 --> 03:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
discreet cases uh as representative llad
 
03:33:59.229 --> 03:33:59.239 align:start position:0%
said should this legislation pass it
 
03:34:01.229 --> 03:34:01.239 align:start position:0%
would be approximately $140 million a
 
03:34:03.269 --> 03:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
year in Lost Revenue to the university
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
system to representative woodcock's uh
 
03:34:07.870 --> 03:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
question we are across the system about
 
03:34:10.189 --> 03:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
5050 in state and out UNH is maybe a
 
03:34:11.710 --> 03:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
little bit more out of state than in
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
state while keen and Plymouth are a
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more in State versus out and
 
03:34:18.990 --> 03:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
then graned State largely is in state um
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
those numbers do fluctuate for example
 
03:34:24.030 --> 03:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
some of our most recent uh admissions
 
03:34:25.590 --> 03:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
data at the University of New Hampshire
 
03:34:27.389 --> 03:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
we're seeing an uptaken inate applicant
 
03:34:29.429 --> 03:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
so they do hover around but 5050 is
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
approximately a fair uh approximation so
 
03:34:33.790 --> 03:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
I think we would essentially for purpose
 
03:34:35.349 --> 03:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal note and otherwise assume
 
03:34:37.389 --> 03:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
that should this legislation pass any
 
03:34:39.550 --> 03:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
nonresident student would immediately
 
03:34:42.429 --> 03:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
register to vote for a $15,000 a year
 
03:34:44.750 --> 03:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
plus discount on their education uh
 
03:34:47.349 --> 03:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
which given those numbers would be uh
 
03:34:49.189 --> 03:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
tremendously tremendously difficult
 
03:34:52.469 --> 03:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
Revenue situation for the University um
 
03:34:54.030 --> 03:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
again as representative Oregon mentioned
 
03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is I think nearly identical to
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh what was House Bill 429 last year
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
that was referred to the election law
 
03:35:02.590 --> 03:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
committee was it out of that committee
 
03:35:04.710 --> 03:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
20 to nothing but was one of the series
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
of bills that did not get acted on on
 
03:35:08.990 --> 03:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
the floor uh at crossover last year so
 
03:35:10.990 --> 03:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh we would encourage you to follow that
 
03:35:13.590 --> 03:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
lead um of election law and itl this one
 
03:35:15.030 --> 03:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
as well and I'd be happy to take any
 
03:35:16.750 --> 03:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Mr crin
 
03:35:20.189 --> 03:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
are there questions for the University
 
03:35:24.670 --> 03:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
system I I have one um for years we have
 
03:35:27.030 --> 03:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
tried within the university system to
 
03:35:28.870 --> 03:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
keep our ratio between out ofate and
 
03:35:32.550 --> 03:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
instate tuition students at close to a
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
5050 sometimes it's not right there and
 
03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's very different than that we see
 
03:35:41.550 --> 03:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
over at UVM where we see 80% out of
 
03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
state and 20% inst State my concern is
 
03:35:48.910 --> 03:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
if we go ahead and move in this
 
03:35:52.830 --> 03:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
direction will we then be providing and
 
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
Counting these students which come in
 
03:35:57.150 --> 03:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
for example from
 
03:35:59.910 --> 03:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
Montana stay here for four years and
 
03:36:02.550 --> 03:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
then exit back to
 
03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
Missoula um are we then going to be
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
sliding our instate and cutting off the
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
number of kids which really have lived
 
03:36:12.189 --> 03:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
here and graduated from high school here
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
and our in state students that's a great
 
03:36:15.990 --> 03:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
Point representative I mean certainly it
 
03:36:18.830 --> 03:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
would be I think a attractor to out
 
03:36:20.590 --> 03:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
ofate students I mean this would be a
 
03:36:22.950 --> 03:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
significantly lower uh rate than they'd
 
03:36:24.670 --> 03:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
pay to attend some other out ofate
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
school perhaps than their local school
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
um so certainly it would be something to
 
03:36:31.269 --> 03:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
attract students from across the country
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
I do think as you know as a a member of
 
03:36:35.910 --> 03:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
the board um we do try and prioritize if
 
03:36:37.630 --> 03:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
you have two equal students a New
 
03:36:40.110 --> 03:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident and a non-resident we
 
03:36:41.950 --> 03:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
are unfortunately at a position where we
 
03:36:43.870 --> 03:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
are full up in all of our classes but in
 
03:36:45.269 --> 03:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
that case we would always prioritize a
 
03:36:47.550 --> 03:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire resident for uh limited
 
03:36:49.469 --> 03:36:49.479 align:start position:0%
spots um so I think it's likely you
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
would see an increase in enrollment but
 
03:36:53.189 --> 03:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh not at a rate that we need to
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
continue to sustain operations thank
 
03:36:58.590 --> 03:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
you representa Tanner then
 
03:36:58.600 --> 03:36:59.790 align:start position:0%
you representa Tanner then
representative

03:36:59.790 --> 03:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:37:02.429 --> 03:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
wood I may be taking representative
 
03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
Woodcock steam here but I'd like to ask
 
03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
if you think you could make up that
 
03:37:08.990 --> 03:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
money those millions of dollars by doing
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:17.510 --> 03:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
not Woodcock was that your question well
 
03:37:20.189 --> 03:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
it was one thank you okay you got one
 
03:37:21.990 --> 03:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
may have one more representative yes
 
03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr con thank you for
 
03:37:26.469 --> 03:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
testifying I appreciate the information
 
03:37:30.309 --> 03:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
um as far as UNH in the bigger picture
 
03:37:33.950 --> 03:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh with instate tuition um how how do we
 
03:37:36.550 --> 03:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
stand in terms of the other primary
 
03:37:39.189 --> 03:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
major uh State institutions across the
 
03:37:41.590 --> 03:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
F50 you have a b we are on that yeah so
 
03:37:43.630 --> 03:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
I think as as as is well documented New
 
03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of the more expensive
 
03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
um some years the most expensive public
 
03:37:51.510 --> 03:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
hire education system in the country um
 
03:37:53.710 --> 03:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
representative lad referenced Vermont uh
 
03:37:55.229 --> 03:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
usually we are buying back and forth
 
03:37:57.189 --> 03:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
with Vermont for that unfortunate
 
03:37:58.710 --> 03:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
distinction uh as folks in this
 
03:38:00.830 --> 03:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
committee know uh us and Vermont also
 
03:38:02.189 --> 03:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
share a distinction of being one of the
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
lowest funded public education systems
 
03:38:06.189 --> 03:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
in the country um so right now we are
 
03:38:08.469 --> 03:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
among the more expens thank you thank
 
03:38:10.870 --> 03:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
you represent chairman l further
 
03:38:13.189 --> 03:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative luno thank
 
03:38:14.750 --> 03:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair and thanks very
 
03:38:16.349 --> 03:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
much Mr Cronin for being here this
 
03:38:19.349 --> 03:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon and this morning as well um
 
03:38:21.670 --> 03:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
just for context obviously the fiscal
 
03:38:23.950 --> 03:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
note talks about approximately $140
 
03:38:26.990 --> 03:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
million loss if um if current out of
 
03:38:30.309 --> 03:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
state students um uh convert over to um
 
03:38:33.790 --> 03:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
to instate tuition um could you put that
 
03:38:38.189 --> 03:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
number say in the context of what the um
 
03:38:40.750 --> 03:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
um University of New Hampshire provides
 
03:38:43.269 --> 03:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
students for financial
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
aid I cannot unfortunately I I will get
 
03:38:48.670 --> 03:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
back to you on that but one of the uh
 
03:38:50.469 --> 03:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
the concerns we would have in the event
 
03:38:52.750 --> 03:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
there was a piece of legislation like
 
03:38:54.670 --> 03:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
this that became law would be we would
 
03:38:56.429 --> 03:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
largely need to cut financial aid
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
significantly that is more likely how we
 
03:39:00.870 --> 03:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
would address Revenue shortfalls we
 
03:39:02.550 --> 03:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
would increase rates for everybody
 
03:39:03.670 --> 03:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
because essentially everybody would be
 
03:39:05.150 --> 03:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
paying the same rate we would have to
 
03:39:07.309 --> 03:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
reduce financial aid availability right
 
03:39:10.750 --> 03:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
so followup Mr chair yes so um
 
03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
and and it was a little bit of an unfair
 
03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
question do you have the answer because
 
03:39:16.870 --> 03:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have it right in front of you
 
03:39:18.870 --> 03:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
but yeah so this is sort of like a would
 
03:39:21.309 --> 03:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
you believe so I'm I'm actually looking
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
at the 20 um 2029 I'm sorry 2019 uh
 
03:39:27.429 --> 03:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
comprehensive annual financial report
 
03:39:30.269 --> 03:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
the caffer and um I'm sure I've got the
 
03:39:33.550 --> 03:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
2021 on here but the 2019 came up one
 
03:39:35.950 --> 03:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
first so would you believe that student
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
financial aid for the University system
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is um is $196 million
 
03:39:45.309 --> 03:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
uh I certainly would believe that and I
 
03:39:47.389 --> 03:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
think if you looked at 21 uh you would
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
have seen that number continue to
 
03:39:50.710 --> 03:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
increase that has been a primary focus
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the board and of Campus leadership is
 
03:39:54.429 --> 03:39:54.439 align:start position:0%
to continue to increase financial aid
 
03:39:55.870 --> 03:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
offering really for both instate and out
 
03:39:57.870 --> 03:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
of state students um so I'm confident if
 
03:39:59.229 --> 03:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
you looked at that most recent report
 
03:40:00.590 --> 03:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
the number would actually be a tick High
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%

represent amher New Hampshire uh I will
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
explain why I'm introducing this bill
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
beforehand before introducing the bill
 
03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
as the youngest uh representative in New
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history
 
03:41:43.070 --> 03:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is tremendously important to
 
03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
me as many of us know mental health is
 
03:41:48.030 --> 03:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
an ofer often overlooked part of
 
03:41:51.229 --> 03:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
healthare and our Health Care system the
 
03:41:53.750 --> 03:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
problem is especially uh pressing when
 
03:41:55.550 --> 03:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
it comes to young adults with most
 
03:41:56.910 --> 03:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
mental health conditions appearing
 
03:41:58.269 --> 03:41:58.279 align:start position:0%
before age
 
03:42:00.670 --> 03:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
25 this issue is compounded by the
 
03:42:02.910 --> 03:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
stress of young adulthood transitioning
 
03:42:04.510 --> 03:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
from high school to full adult
 
03:42:08.510 --> 03:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
Independence being a hard transition for
 
03:42:12.269 --> 03:42:12.279 align:start position:0%
many I know that myself having just
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
turned 20 being a representative a
 
03:42:16.389 --> 03:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
part-time college student working
 
03:42:18.550 --> 03:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
part-time it can be a struggle to fit
 
03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
schedule I will not hide it from the
 
03:42:25.710 --> 03:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
committee but I myself have struggled
 
03:42:25.720 --> 03:42:26.630 align:start position:0%
committee but I myself have struggled
with

03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
depression I've been without a therapist
 
03:42:30.910 --> 03:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
since June of 2021 and have been
 
03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
searching for one since then and have
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
yet to find one it is hard to find a
 
03:42:37.070 --> 03:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
therapist that deals with young adults
 
03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
and truly understands us as young adults
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities are the
 
03:42:44.070 --> 03:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
perfect place to bridge the gap between
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
students with mental health needs and
 
03:42:47.550 --> 03:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
finding the help and services that they
 
03:42:49.149 --> 03:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
need sorry I think I'm G to take off my
 
03:42:51.990 --> 03:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:55.229 --> 03:42:55.239 align:start position:0%
quick now how does this bill address
 
03:42:57.550 --> 03:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill seeks to identify more
 
03:42:58.990 --> 03:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
students with mental health needs and
 
03:43:01.790 --> 03:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
connect them with access and services
 
03:43:03.389 --> 03:43:03.399 align:start position:0%
increase mental health services offered
 
03:43:05.349 --> 03:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
by colleges increase access to
 
03:43:07.630 --> 03:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
off-campus Mental Health Services and
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
provide training to raas advisers and
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
other staff and identifying the signs of
 
03:43:14.309 --> 03:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
mental health crises this is a low cost
 
03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
and simple modification that will help
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
many students find the help that they
 
03:43:18.910 --> 03:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
need and that they
 
03:43:21.189 --> 03:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
deserve now let me close off my remarks
 
03:43:24.030 --> 03:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
with this my best friend who is a little
 
03:43:25.990 --> 03:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
bit younger than me has suffered with
 
03:43:29.510 --> 03:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
mental health issues such as thoughts of
 
03:43:31.950 --> 03:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
suicide when he reached out for help he
 
03:43:33.590 --> 03:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
was sent to the hospital where he spent
 
03:43:35.870 --> 03:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
eight days waiting for Pediatric bed to
 
03:43:39.189 --> 03:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
open up eight days of hearing screaming
 
03:43:42.189 --> 03:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
being surrounded by by dep and traumatic
 
03:43:44.590 --> 03:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
events spending 8 days in an emergency
 
03:43:46.830 --> 03:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
room did not help my friend if anything
 
03:43:48.790 --> 03:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
it re-traumatized them and made
 
03:43:51.389 --> 03:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
everything worse that is why this bill
 
03:43:53.429 --> 03:43:53.439 align:start position:0%
is so important we need to help bridge
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
the gap between those who need help and
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
the help that they need I hate to say
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
this but this is the lowest cost
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
solution to this issue besides simply
 
03:44:03.550 --> 03:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
ignoring it and with that I ask that you
 
03:44:05.269 --> 03:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
pass this bill with ought to pass and I
 
03:44:06.750 --> 03:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
am happy to answer any questions
 
03:44:08.550 --> 03:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
although some might be answered by the
 
03:44:10.750 --> 03:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
speakers behind me
 
03:44:12.830 --> 03:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh and I also have a statement from
 
03:44:15.630 --> 03:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
another member that could not be here
 
03:44:17.670 --> 03:44:17.680 align:start position:0%

03:44:20.030 --> 03:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
to I can wait to read the statement and
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
answer question read that one following
 
03:44:26.110 --> 03:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
um the questions your questions to you
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
um are there any questions for the
 
03:44:31.990 --> 03:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
speaker right now for the
 
03:44:36.269 --> 03:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.710 --> 03:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
om thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:44:41.149 --> 03:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
03:44:43.790 --> 03:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
all through life you might say there are
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
peer groups set up for all kinds of
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
diseases voluntary peer groups so why
 
03:44:54.229 --> 03:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
can't that same thing be done in
 
03:44:56.469 --> 03:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
different colleges and universities
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
people can get together and start peer
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
groups for pretty much anything which
 
03:45:05.149 --> 03:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
has been done so why can't you do it
 
03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
without the state involved uh as a
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
patient who had colon cancer at a young
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
age uh I have been part of peer groups
 
03:45:19.309 --> 03:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh as you mentioned um this is basically
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
making it so that there is a
 
03:45:21.990 --> 03:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
professional in the room as mental
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
health is such a complex topic and um we
 
03:45:28.269 --> 03:45:28.279 align:start position:0%
don't want uh unpr uh people who are not
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
trained in dealing with mental health
 
03:45:31.870 --> 03:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
issues being the ones that you go for
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
professional help because uh people
 
03:45:38.750 --> 03:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
deserve uh help in uh a professional
 
03:45:38.760 --> 03:45:43.870 align:start position:0%
deserve uh help in uh a professional
manner

03:45:43.870 --> 03:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:43.880 --> 03:45:44.710 align:start position:0%
 
thank

03:45:44.710 --> 03:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:45:47.710 --> 03:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you my question thank you my
 
03:45:51.149 --> 03:45:51.159 align:start position:0%
question it's a simple one um this uh
 
03:45:54.389 --> 03:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
Bill if pass would apply to all colleges
 
03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire correct uh it would
 
03:46:00.309 --> 03:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
apply to all uh State uh colleges and
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
universities so the community college
 
03:46:04.149 --> 03:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
system and the UN system all
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
public one more thank you um are you
 
03:46:10.510 --> 03:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
aware of any I guess I'm trying to sign
 
03:46:11.830 --> 03:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
besides the acknowledgement that there
 
03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
is not sufficient Services across that
 
03:46:17.950 --> 03:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of any programs
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
currently in place in our college system
 
03:46:22.630 --> 03:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
that is trying to reach out and help uh
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
in one way or
 
03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
another or is this just a void you're
 
03:46:27.349 --> 03:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
fill I believe some
 
03:46:32.189 --> 03:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
colleges um I believe this is more of an
 
03:46:34.910 --> 03:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
effort to standardize this uh because
 
03:46:36.269 --> 03:46:36.279 align:start position:0%
every college and university is
 
03:46:37.710 --> 03:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
different in how they reach out to their
 
03:46:40.349 --> 03:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
students uh with mental health issues
 
03:46:42.870 --> 03:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
um and as somebody who has been looking
 
03:46:44.189 --> 03:46:44.199 align:start position:0%
for a therapist and goes to the
 
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
community college system it has been
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
hard to find
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
help thank you thank you represent W
 
03:46:52.590 --> 03:46:52.600 align:start position:0%

03:46:55.670 --> 03:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent
 
03:47:00.269 --> 03:47:00.279 align:start position:0%
lakus I have two questions one if you're
 
03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
having trouble finding a therapist
 
03:47:04.830 --> 03:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
because there's a
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
shortage um how are the universities
 
03:47:11.469 --> 03:47:11.479 align:start position:0%
going to therapists willing to partner
 
03:47:11.479 --> 03:47:12.750 align:start position:0%
going to therapists willing to partner
with

03:47:12.750 --> 03:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:47:16.830 --> 03:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
them so in this legislation it uh states
 
03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
that the college will uh form agreements
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
with uh providers in the area um this
 
03:47:26.149 --> 03:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
will be professionals who are trained to
 
03:47:28.349 --> 03:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
deal with young adults uh I believe that
 
03:47:30.030 --> 03:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
is one of the biggest pressing concerns
 
03:47:33.630 --> 03:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
I understand there is a shortage but um
 
03:47:36.750 --> 03:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
even just finding someone who uh deals
 
03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
with young adults is difficult um and
 
03:47:41.469 --> 03:47:41.479 align:start position:0%
this would standardize the process of
 
03:47:43.030 --> 03:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
finding somebody that can at least treat
 
03:47:44.950 --> 03:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
young adults and not just a generalized
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
therapist and going through your
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
insurance and your primary care doctor
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
and trying to find a care
 
03:47:52.830 --> 03:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
provider thank you and can I ask a SLE
 
03:47:57.710 --> 03:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
question yes how how will you um
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:07.429 --> 03:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
help this is a a obviously you can
 
03:48:08.910 --> 03:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
identify the signs it does not mean
 
03:48:10.670 --> 03:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
somebody need needs to get help because
 
03:48:12.910 --> 03:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
it's always up to the individual to get
 
03:48:16.750 --> 03:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
help this is more if you have an issue
 
03:48:18.189 --> 03:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
uh a mental health issue and you would
 
03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
like to find help that you can find help
 
03:48:23.070 --> 03:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
this is not mandating that uh people are
 
03:48:24.550 --> 03:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
I I saw an email from somebody
 
03:48:28.269 --> 03:48:28.279 align:start position:0%
testifying uh saying that it would uh
 
03:48:30.630 --> 03:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
you would identify individuals and send
 
03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
them to help that is not what this bill
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
does this is simply giving access to the
 
03:48:37.870 --> 03:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
the mental health that people need thank
 
03:48:42.830 --> 03:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.790 --> 03:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
questions oh yes represent Nelson thank
 
03:48:48.429 --> 03:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
03:48:51.469 --> 03:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
chairman would you expect all people to
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
be together with this disability or
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
would you want each group dealing with
 
03:49:00.550 --> 03:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
specific subjects that they need to talk
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
with LA support groups support groups um
 
03:49:07.389 --> 03:49:07.399 align:start position:0%
I believe that will be a a colleg to col
 
03:49:08.830 --> 03:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
basis depending on how many students and
 
03:49:10.429 --> 03:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
how many students want to participate in
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
these programs uh My Hope Is that many
 
03:49:14.630 --> 03:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
students who do need help participate in
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
these programs and they can always form
 
03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
groups that are specialized in
 
03:49:21.070 --> 03:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
depression and anxiety but uh at least
 
03:49:24.550 --> 03:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
having a general mental health uh group
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:49:30.030 --> 03:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
helpful yes thank you how would elig
 
03:49:31.830 --> 03:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility be
 
03:49:33.950 --> 03:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
determined is it just to stop in
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
actually I don't feel good to I want to
 
03:49:36.990 --> 03:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
talk to everybody or is it you have to
 
03:49:38.030 --> 03:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:49:40.389 --> 03:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
many mental health issues go
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
undiagnosed like we had mentioned before
 
03:49:47.149 --> 03:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
there are issues of access to
 
03:49:49.349 --> 03:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
professionals and getting a professional
 
03:49:52.990 --> 03:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um I I I would assume that it
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
would be a voluntary uh you don't need a
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
diagnosis to go to these help groups
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
just like Alcoholics Anonymous or other
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh illnesses that you go to a support
 
03:50:05.149 --> 03:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
group it would be just like that so it's
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
a self-identified knot you don't need to
 
03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
walk in there with the doctor's note is
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:13.950 --> 03:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
yes represent M thank you Mr chair and
 
03:50:16.750 --> 03:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony for being
 
03:50:20.149 --> 03:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
here do you foresee any possible privacy
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
issues in terms of uh people having to
 
03:50:26.550 --> 03:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
disclose uh health condition to
 
03:50:29.110 --> 03:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
participate or to be eligible
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
for uh some involvement in this program
 
03:50:35.229 --> 03:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
uh privacy issues have you're given that
 
03:50:37.349 --> 03:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
any any consideration uh the peer
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
support group as I had mentioned earlier
 
03:50:41.269 --> 03:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
is a voluntary you go there because you
 
03:50:42.870 --> 03:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
want help and you acknowledge that you
 
03:50:44.189 --> 03:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
will be talking about your mental
 
03:50:46.429 --> 03:50:46.439 align:start position:0%
illness with other individuals in that
 
03:50:49.229 --> 03:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
group but everything else is uh purely
 
03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary and you will only be uh
 
03:50:52.750 --> 03:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
disclosing that with a mental health
 
03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
professional and all the Hippa rules
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
apply to that follow
 
03:51:00.950 --> 03:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
up so I I'm I'm wondering about
 
03:51:03.229 --> 03:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
attending the peer support group would
 
03:51:06.469 --> 03:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
there be uh Records taken minutes uh
 
03:51:06.479 --> 03:51:07.670 align:start position:0%
there be uh Records taken minutes uh
attendance

03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
attendees uh
 
03:51:12.590 --> 03:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that someone may or may not
 
03:51:14.670 --> 03:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
have something diagnosed if they show up
 
03:51:18.110 --> 03:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
at one of these uh sessions um and
 
03:51:20.030 --> 03:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
they're on a list of attendees or people
 
03:51:22.830 --> 03:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
know that they attended I'm wondering if
 
03:51:25.229 --> 03:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
there's possible stigmatization that
 
03:51:28.149 --> 03:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
could flow from that you tracking my my
 
03:51:32.189 --> 03:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
concern uh yes and I would say that um a
 
03:51:33.910 --> 03:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
lot of the public knows about Alcoholics
 
03:51:36.750 --> 03:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
Anonymous groups um it's it's Anonymous
 
03:51:38.349 --> 03:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
uh and that's the same idea here there's
 
03:51:40.710 --> 03:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
no records taken and there's no uh
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
there's no paper trail is what I'm
 
03:51:46.030 --> 03:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
trying to say and it's just um we we
 
03:51:47.670 --> 03:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
trust each other uh if you go to that
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
group uh when everything stays in the
 
03:51:51.670 --> 03:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
Alcoholics Anonymous session it's the
 
03:51:54.670 --> 03:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing here thank
 
03:52:00.550 --> 03:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:02.910 --> 03:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:52:05.510 --> 03:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
03:52:09.389 --> 03:52:09.399 align:start position:0%
question my question is does your bill
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
the use of tele medicine T Health
 
03:52:16.110 --> 03:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
Medicine yes um and I will actually
 
03:52:18.830 --> 03:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
start that with a a personal note um
 
03:52:22.309 --> 03:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
before um before the pandemic I had to
 
03:52:24.630 --> 03:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
see my mental health professional in
 
03:52:27.189 --> 03:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
Boston driving an hour away since uh
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
cental Health was not an option and it
 
03:52:31.790 --> 03:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
still is not an option I I was lucky
 
03:52:33.309 --> 03:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
enough that during the pandemic they
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
allowed uh tele medicine so I could see
 
03:52:38.110 --> 03:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
that uh mental health professional but
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
yes this bill does include tele Health U
 
03:52:43.870 --> 03:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
tele medicine I should say U so that
 
03:52:48.870 --> 03:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:50.790 --> 03:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
professional are there any other
 
03:52:53.469 --> 03:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee yes representer
 
03:53:00.030 --> 03:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
Nelson just have a con a crazy concern
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
if you have six students that are
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
involved in this which is a good idea
 
03:53:06.429 --> 03:53:06.439 align:start position:0%
how is it paid for are insurance
 
03:53:09.070 --> 03:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
companies paying six different insurance
 
03:53:11.670 --> 03:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
companies paying the same Professor or
 
03:53:14.790 --> 03:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
different professors or uh people for
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
counseling uh I believe peer support
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
groups uh like I had mentioned earlier
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
like Alcoholics Anonymous or other
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
support groups um there's no cost to
 
03:53:31.710 --> 03:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:36.030 --> 03:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:38.950 --> 03:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you chairman lad uh and
 
03:53:38.960 --> 03:53:39.950 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you chairman lad uh and
welcome

03:53:39.950 --> 03:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative um my question has to do
 
03:53:46.510 --> 03:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
with the arrangements between local
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
resources and the college
 
03:53:52.149 --> 03:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
campus um I I'm assuming that there
 
03:53:55.189 --> 03:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
would in fact be a bill associated with
 
03:53:58.710 --> 03:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
Contracting with people in the local
 
03:54:01.830 --> 03:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
community um and there are some costs
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
estimated in here uh to the university
 
03:54:09.630 --> 03:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
system uh that are around a a million
 
03:54:14.349 --> 03:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
two basically in total um do you have
 
03:54:17.590 --> 03:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
any sense of uh sort of piggybacking on
 
03:54:20.590 --> 03:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson's question um
 
03:54:23.229 --> 03:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
would would those services that are
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
contracted be paid for by the University
 
03:54:30.269 --> 03:54:30.279 align:start position:0%
or would an individual student's medical
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
health insurance cover the cost
 
03:54:36.429 --> 03:54:36.439 align:start position:0%
of involving
 
03:54:38.990 --> 03:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
professionals as the fiscal note uh
 
03:54:41.189 --> 03:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
States it would be the college system
 
03:54:43.349 --> 03:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
but I believe that that is for finding
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
initial help and then after that you
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
have found your therapist I believe uh
 
03:54:49.750 --> 03:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
if you do have insurance or insurance
 
03:54:52.149 --> 03:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
will kick in at that
 
03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
point at least that's my understanding
 
03:54:57.790 --> 03:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
further questions not seeing any hands
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
now you also said you had a statement
 
03:55:02.590 --> 03:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
from another individual yep uh I have a
 
03:55:05.510 --> 03:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
how long is that a page and a half it
 
03:55:06.910 --> 03:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
seems rather than reading the whole
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
thing can you just submit that to the
 
03:55:10.630 --> 03:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
Clerk and clerk can put that into the
 
03:55:15.510 --> 03:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
you okay are these the same group
 
03:55:22.149 --> 03:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
here yes representative Porter you have
 
03:55:22.159 --> 03:55:28.630 align:start position:0%
here yes representative Porter you have
a

03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.149 --> 03:55:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:39.990 --> 03:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
you we can copy made of that and
 
03:55:43.269 --> 03:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
distribute to everybody okay make it
 
03:55:46.149 --> 03:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
simple okay the next person to speak is
 
03:55:50.030 --> 03:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:52.990 --> 03:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
Murray good afternoon thank you
 
03:55:55.590 --> 03:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
chairman my name is Megan Murray I
 
03:55:57.510 --> 03:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Amherst New
 
03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I did submit uh for the
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
record of an electronic copy of my
 
03:56:03.189 --> 03:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
testimony so I'm not going to believe
 
03:56:05.830 --> 03:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
her the point I would like to note
 
03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
however that to touch on some of the
 
03:56:11.229 --> 03:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
things that the spor mentioned um my
 
03:56:14.550 --> 03:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
intent is to see access to resources and
 
03:56:17.030 --> 03:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities continue to be presented
 
03:56:18.670 --> 03:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
for folks with mental
 
03:56:22.990 --> 03:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
illness as we know um individuals
 
03:56:25.510 --> 03:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
seeking treatment or care or may who who
 
03:56:27.710 --> 03:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
may just be starting out on that Journey
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
may not know where to go at all for help
 
03:56:32.910 --> 03:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
and a peer support is one of those first
 
03:56:36.790 --> 03:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
steps that somebody May seek to take in
 
03:56:40.830 --> 03:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
in saying that I would also like to note
 
03:56:43.309 --> 03:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
that um as college students are
 
03:56:45.870 --> 03:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
transitioning into the workforce is
 
03:56:48.510 --> 03:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
crucial that they understand what
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
support they have for themselves going
 
03:56:53.229 --> 03:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
into a community oftentimes folks with
 
03:56:54.990 --> 03:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
mental health conditions require
 
03:56:57.389 --> 03:56:57.399 align:start position:0%
appointments that are weekly or
 
03:57:00.790 --> 03:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly monthly in nature um and often
 
03:57:02.469 --> 03:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
times that requires them to schedule
 
03:57:04.950 --> 03:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
them around their work environment so
 
03:57:07.950 --> 03:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
having those opportunities to start that
 
03:57:10.630 --> 03:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
trajectory towards Wellness in the
 
03:57:13.910 --> 03:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
College Community I find um to be
 
03:57:17.349 --> 03:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful and as we know um
 
03:57:19.269 --> 03:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a lack of short
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
shortage of providers like you all have
 
03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
noted but I think um having heard from
 
03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
some young individuals out in the
 
03:57:28.189 --> 03:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
community and their testimony that what
 
03:57:30.630 --> 03:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
they are asking for is for individuals
 
03:57:32.830 --> 03:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
who have been through such similar
 
03:57:36.349 --> 03:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
situation to help at least in guiding
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
the conversation of where to begin for
 
03:57:40.389 --> 03:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
where to go next just like we had
 
03:57:43.149 --> 03:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned um with whether it's Narcotics
 
03:57:45.309 --> 03:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous that
 
03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
is really the intent of connecting folks
 
03:57:51.990 --> 03:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the University system to resources so
 
03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
I thank you thank you very much are
 
03:57:58.510 --> 03:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much for
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:07.520 --> 03:58:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:58:11.030 --> 03:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:12.990 --> 03:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
next speaker is Shannon Reed community
 
03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:26.910 --> 03:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you Mr chairman for the
 
03:58:28.750 --> 03:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
record my name is Shannon Reed I'm here
 
03:58:30.189 --> 03:58:30.199 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the community college
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
system of New
 
03:58:34.590 --> 03:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ccsnh values the intent of
 
03:58:36.389 --> 03:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
this bill but with respect we cannot
 
03:58:38.710 --> 03:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
support it as written we we do
 
03:58:40.149 --> 03:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate the attention that is being
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
paid to the mental health of college age
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
students we followed higher education
 
03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
news about mental health issues
 
03:58:51.189 --> 03:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
including um students on uh I'm sorry
 
03:58:53.910 --> 03:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
including suicides on campuses um
 
03:58:55.389 --> 03:58:55.399 align:start position:0%
including recently in the New England
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
region at colleges like WPI Dartmouth
 
03:59:00.550 --> 03:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
and nor Eastern these are tragic and
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking isolation caused by the
 
03:59:04.750 --> 03:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic has certainly played a role in
 
03:59:07.349 --> 03:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
this recent Boston Globe coverage on the
 
03:59:10.110 --> 03:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
suicides at WP pi and Dartmouth pointed
 
03:59:12.269 --> 03:59:12.279 align:start position:0%
to students isolated in dorm rooms
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
taking classes remotely eating their
 
03:59:16.910 --> 03:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
meals alone in dorms with very limited
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
extracurricular or social activities and
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
having very little interaction with
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
their peers across campus this is
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
certainly exacerbated mental health
 
03:59:26.990 --> 03:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
challenges already faced by many in this
 
03:59:29.389 --> 03:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
age group the mental health of our
 
03:59:31.950 --> 03:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
students is a focus of our work we
 
03:59:33.550 --> 03:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
strive to put in place supports and
 
03:59:36.550 --> 03:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
linkages that are helpful compassionate
 
03:59:38.870 --> 03:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
accessible and effective given the
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
nature of the population that we serve
 
03:59:43.030 --> 03:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
and the kind of Campus environments that
 
03:59:45.870 --> 03:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
we have in the last few years we have
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
created new opportunities for students
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
to access mental health supports such as
 
03:59:52.510 --> 03:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
free access to tella health for mental
 
03:59:54.550 --> 03:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
health check-ins during high stress
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
times of year links and referrals to
 
03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
area mental health agencies and
 
04:00:01.189 --> 04:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
maintaining life supports like food
 
04:00:04.229 --> 04:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
pantries as we review hb1
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
1648 we would caution the legislature
 
04:00:08.510 --> 04:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
about considering legislation for
 
04:00:10.590 --> 04:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
community colleges in the same way it
 
04:00:13.590 --> 04:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
might for large residential campuses we
 
04:00:15.550 --> 04:00:15.560 align:start position:0%
do not have the traditional Residence
 
04:00:18.189 --> 04:00:18.199 align:start position:0%
Life core with thousands of 18 to 22
 
04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
year olds spending 24 hours a day seven
 
04:00:23.149 --> 04:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
days a week 40 weeks a year living
 
04:00:25.429 --> 04:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
together with the college or university
 
04:00:27.229 --> 04:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
acting in local parentice for these
 
04:00:29.590 --> 04:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
students we care deeply about student
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
mental health but the root to supporting
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
that is vastly different for us than the
 
04:00:35.349 --> 04:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
residential four-year
 
04:00:39.149 --> 04:00:39.159 align:start position:0%
campuses for instance ccs does not have
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
the same type of all-encompassing
 
04:00:42.349 --> 04:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
residential life programs that a
 
04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
four-year college has the vast majority
 
04:00:46.990 --> 04:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
of our students live at home and commute
 
04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
to campus of our seven colleges only one
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
an HG here in conquer has dormitories
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
and about 9% of its students live on
 
04:00:57.870 --> 04:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
campus that's about 350 out of
 
04:01:00.309 --> 04:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
4,000 another Lakes Region community
 
04:01:02.349 --> 04:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
college offers apartment style living
 
04:01:04.389 --> 04:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
adjacent to campus with about 60
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
students in the apartments out of 800
 
04:01:07.239 --> 04:01:09.030 align:start position:0%
students in the apartments out of 800
enrolled

04:01:09.030 --> 04:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
enrolled
 
04:01:11.070 --> 04:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
Community College institutions do not
 
04:01:13.269 --> 04:01:13.279 align:start position:0%
have the scope of on-campus mental
 
04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
health services including the Staffing
 
04:01:17.229 --> 04:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
to manage triage and short-term
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
stabilization and treatment nor do we
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
have psychiatrists who can prescribe and
 
04:01:22.830 --> 04:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
monitor medications that are
 
04:01:24.349 --> 04:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
increasingly part of the treatment for
 
04:01:26.790 --> 04:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
mental health issues often already
 
04:01:28.110 --> 04:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
identified while students are still in
 
04:01:31.030 --> 04:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
high school the mandatory fees used to
 
04:01:32.830 --> 04:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
support these services at most forear
 
04:01:34.590 --> 04:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
institutions would create an additional
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
barrier to both both postsecondary
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
education and the intended care for most
 
04:01:41.870 --> 04:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
of the students served by community
 
04:01:44.110 --> 04:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
colleges the Partnerships that this
 
04:01:46.670 --> 04:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
legislation envisions actually mandates
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
would create unique challenges for
 
04:01:51.389 --> 04:01:51.399 align:start position:0%
community colleges in rural areas
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
requiring providers to be available and
 
04:01:54.750 --> 04:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
sufficiently staffed to support
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
referrals and willing to accept payment
 
04:01:57.870 --> 04:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
consistent with the resources of our
 
04:02:00.070 --> 04:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
students many of whom are eligible for
 
04:02:02.349 --> 04:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
pel Grants and likely to be insured
 
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
through expanded medicaid or potentially
 
04:02:07.469 --> 04:02:07.479 align:start position:0%
uninsured we do have privacy concerns
 
04:02:09.389 --> 04:02:09.399 align:start position:0%
particularly in the evaluation section
 
04:02:12.189 --> 04:02:12.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill and we have academic freedom
 
04:02:14.149 --> 04:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
concerns with respect to language about
 
04:02:15.670 --> 04:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
integrating mental health awareness
 
04:02:18.309 --> 04:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
curricula into courses and
 
04:02:20.630 --> 04:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
seminars when our campuses are faced
 
04:02:22.189 --> 04:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
with identical mandates to those
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
envisioned for larger and more
 
04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive campus environments the
 
04:02:27.630 --> 04:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
result tends to be the imposition of
 
04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
policies and compliance requirements
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
that are unrealistic and not well
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
aligned or developed to fit the needs
 
04:02:35.389 --> 04:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
and experiences of our students it's
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
also worth asking whether the state
 
04:02:39.309 --> 04:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
currently has or in the future expects
 
04:02:40.990 --> 04:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
to have sufficient Mental Health
 
04:02:42.990 --> 04:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
Resources particularly again in rural
 
04:02:45.189 --> 04:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
areas to support the linkage agreements
 
04:02:47.830 --> 04:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
required in the bill for example pre
 
04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic in Sullivan County the weight
 
04:02:51.990 --> 04:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
was more than 12 weeks to be seen for
 
04:02:54.349 --> 04:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
all non-crisis mental health
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
issues we ask also that you pay
 
04:02:58.550 --> 04:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
attention to the fiscal note for the
 
04:03:00.269 --> 04:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
community colleges there would be a very
 
04:03:02.110 --> 04:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
large cost to creating and sustaining
 
04:03:03.429 --> 04:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
the programming and other requirements
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill the very specific and
 
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
prescriptive requirements could also
 
04:03:09.429 --> 04:03:09.439 align:start position:0%
prevent us from optimizing other kinds
 
04:03:11.229 --> 04:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
of supports that would be useful and
 
04:03:12.630 --> 04:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
accessible for our
 
04:03:14.429 --> 04:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
population thank you and I'm happy to
 
04:03:14.439 --> 04:03:15.389 align:start position:0%
population thank you and I'm happy to
take

04:03:15.389 --> 04:03:15.399 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh Shannon I got one
 
04:03:21.710 --> 04:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
question for you um the effective date
 
04:03:25.110 --> 04:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
of this legislation is 60 days after
 
04:03:27.149 --> 04:03:27.159 align:start position:0%
passage do you believe the community
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
college system will be able to put this
 
04:03:30.590 --> 04:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
into effect and do it efficiently and
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
effectively within this within the time
 
04:03:35.149 --> 04:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
period of going in effect uh no
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative lad I think that would be
 
04:03:37.080 --> 04:03:41.189 align:start position:0%
representative lad I think that would be
unworkable

04:03:41.189 --> 04:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr chair and um
 
04:03:45.189 --> 04:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much M Reed for being
 
04:03:47.469 --> 04:03:47.479 align:start position:0%
with us today um uh first a quick
 
04:03:50.429 --> 04:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
followup to uh to the chair's um uh
 
04:03:52.429 --> 04:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
question and then I have another
 
04:03:56.910 --> 04:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
question but but do you think um um U
 
04:03:59.070 --> 04:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
some of the policies and procedures that
 
04:04:01.469 --> 04:04:01.479 align:start position:0%
are outlined in this bill could be put
 
04:04:03.910 --> 04:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
in place by not necessarily A 60-day
 
04:04:07.389 --> 04:04:07.399 align:start position:0%
effective date but but perhaps um uh
 
04:04:11.950 --> 04:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
some uh down the road maybe July 1st
 
04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
2023 or
 
04:04:16.750 --> 04:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
2024 thank you representative luno I
 
04:04:18.590 --> 04:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
circulated this bill to our college
 
04:04:21.229 --> 04:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
student affairs offices and suggested
 
04:04:23.189 --> 04:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
that this could provide the foundation
 
04:04:25.630 --> 04:04:25.640 align:start position:0%
for a dialogue about what we are doing
 
04:04:27.950 --> 04:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
what we could be doing what are some
 
04:04:30.269 --> 04:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices that are in
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
this bill or or maybe even not in this
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
bill um that we could be looking at to
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
support our students and so I think that
 
04:04:38.510 --> 04:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
um this bill certainly will have
 
04:04:42.510 --> 04:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
prompted a a a very thorough um launch
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
of or a launch of very thorough
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
conversations about what it is we we can
 
04:04:48.630 --> 04:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
do um without kind of going through it
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
section by section I think there are
 
04:04:52.349 --> 04:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
certainly some things
 
04:04:55.550 --> 04:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
we we we have in place that are similar
 
04:04:57.189 --> 04:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
to what's required some things that
 
04:04:59.070 --> 04:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
would be very very difficult such as you
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
know the the the idea of of peer support
 
04:05:03.750 --> 04:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
groups that's a great idea but peer
 
04:05:06.030 --> 04:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
support groups are historically very
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
difficult to um to sustain
 
04:05:10.030 --> 04:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
you may be able to create them with an
 
04:05:11.469 --> 04:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
initial impetus but sustaining those
 
04:05:13.550 --> 04:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
over time particularly with community
 
04:05:14.910 --> 04:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
college students who are often they're
 
04:05:18.550 --> 04:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
working their parents um H having that
 
04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
kind of an ongoing um infrastructure if
 
04:05:24.110 --> 04:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
you will is something that I think would
 
04:05:26.590 --> 04:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
be would be very challenging right so so
 
04:05:29.309 --> 04:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
you know I guess I would say that to an
 
04:05:31.149 --> 04:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
extent some of these things are are are
 
04:05:34.110 --> 04:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
doable or already in in various ways um
 
04:05:36.830 --> 04:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
being being looked at tella health is
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
one thing that we were able to bring
 
04:05:39.229 --> 04:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
bring on during the pandemic that that I
 
04:05:40.710 --> 04:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
think we're looking at is this something
 
04:05:43.070 --> 04:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
that is being utilized and something we
 
04:05:45.950 --> 04:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
should sustain um but it definitely has
 
04:05:49.870 --> 04:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
his Spar and and um and
 
04:05:52.429 --> 04:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank thank you very very much Mr chair
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
and and and thanks Shannon um for that I
 
04:05:57.950 --> 04:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
mean I'm what I'm sort of poking at is
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
is you know whether or not something
 
04:06:02.469 --> 04:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
like this could even be amended um in a
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
way where where it could maybe um um um
 
04:06:10.590 --> 04:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
coincide with with some of the
 
04:06:12.429 --> 04:06:12.439 align:start position:0%
discussions that that you've you've
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
already had prior to and maybe after you
 
04:06:19.389 --> 04:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
know the introduction of of of this bill
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
but but the the the question that sort
 
04:06:26.349 --> 04:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
of comes up and I think you know you you
 
04:06:29.309 --> 04:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
uh you talked about alluded to
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
it a little bit too is the um is is how
 
04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
um um you know how how various you know
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
mental health U conditions disease um uh
 
04:06:45.550 --> 04:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
affects not only students and their
 
04:06:48.110 --> 04:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
families but also affects the colleges
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
themselves and and I don't even want to
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
try to to
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
quantify um how it affects you know a a
 
04:07:00.590 --> 04:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
student and their their families but but
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
how about the colleges have have there
 
04:07:05.550 --> 04:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
been studies either among our own
 
04:07:08.110 --> 04:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
colleges or or maybe other public or
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
private schools in terms of uh the the
 
04:07:15.149 --> 04:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
actual costs of of mental health on a
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
college campus and and how that affects
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
um campus
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
budgets thank you for the question there
 
04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
a couple parts to that I think certainly
 
04:07:24.910 --> 04:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
there have been surveys there's been
 
04:07:26.590 --> 04:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
research done I I'm not aware of
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
anything that quantifies the effect um
 
04:07:31.550 --> 04:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
of mental health issues on college
 
04:07:35.550 --> 04:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
campuses or quantifies the the cost of
 
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
combating um you know Mental Health
 
04:07:39.630 --> 04:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
issues and mental health challenges you
 
04:07:41.070 --> 04:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned whether there was a
 
04:07:42.750 --> 04:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
possibility to potentially amend this
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill to get at some of you know some of
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
the practices that we'd like to see put
 
04:07:47.790 --> 04:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
in place I think the danger of putting
 
04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
anything in legislation is then that's
 
04:07:52.670 --> 04:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
what you do and there if other things
 
04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
develop that may be more useful more
 
04:07:57.950 --> 04:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
effective more relevant um you're sort
 
04:08:00.189 --> 04:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
of stuck with what's what's been placed
 
04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
in legislation I I think that one
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
strength of our institutions is we are
 
04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
um continually trying to take the the of
 
04:08:10.550 --> 04:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
our student body and and figure out what
 
04:08:15.109 --> 04:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
students need what we can external
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
Partners you know mental health um
 
04:08:20.149 --> 04:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
providers in our regions can provide via
 
04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know linkages and referrals and
 
04:08:26.189 --> 04:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:28.910 --> 04:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
circumstance shift so I guess I would
 
04:08:31.070 --> 04:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
caution you about considering you know
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
what might we pull from this or retain
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
here to keep in legislation because I
 
04:08:37.630 --> 04:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
think that that you create sort of
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
different set of problems doing that you
 
04:08:42.510 --> 04:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
you also create a a significant
 
04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
administrative lift in terms of

Hampshire good afternoon again Mr
 
04:10:34.189 --> 04:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Tom Cronin director of
 
04:10:35.710 --> 04:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
government relations for the University
 
04:10:37.269 --> 04:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
system uh I'm pleased today to be with
 
04:10:39.670 --> 04:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
my colleague uh Marlin Collingwood who
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
is the interim VP for communications
 
04:10:43.590 --> 04:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment and student life at Plymouth
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
State um so let me just start by saying
 
04:10:48.750 --> 04:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
the university system adamantly agrees
 
04:10:51.309 --> 04:10:51.319 align:start position:0%
with the concerns of the sponsor uh I
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
think we hear this across the state uh
 
04:10:55.030 --> 04:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
we are under no illusions that this
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
isn't a critically important issue
 
04:10:59.309 --> 04:10:59.319 align:start position:0%
facing higher education in the country
 
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
fouryear higher education in the country
 
04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is no different um I
 
04:11:05.790 --> 04:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
thought what we could do today if it
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
would be helpful for the committee would
 
04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
actually to turn it over to Marlon for a
 
04:11:11.630 --> 04:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
few minutes to talk about exactly some
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the work we are doing uh in his case
 
04:11:15.550 --> 04:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
specifically at Plymouth but he can also
 
04:11:17.790 --> 04:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
speak to a larger University system lens
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
to try and address this issue currently
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
um and then maybe I could take a couple
 
04:11:23.670 --> 04:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
minutes after Marlin speaks just to walk
 
04:11:24.910 --> 04:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
through some of the concerns we have
 
04:11:27.510 --> 04:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
with this bill uh as drafted and then of
 
04:11:29.229 --> 04:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
course we'd be happy to take
 
04:11:29.239 --> 04:11:31.149 align:start position:0%
course we'd be happy to take
questions

04:11:31.149 --> 04:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
your thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:11:35.109 --> 04:11:35.119 align:start position:0%

University in beautiful Plymouth New
 
04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I want to say a couple
 
04:11:47.389 --> 04:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
things one is all of the universities in
 
04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
the system are dedicated to the
 
04:11:52.109 --> 04:11:52.119 align:start position:0%
emotional physical and mental health of
 
04:11:54.990 --> 04:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
our students right what this bill uh
 
04:11:57.309 --> 04:11:57.319 align:start position:0%
addresses is really really important we
 
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
had the unfortunate situation uh last
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
year at this time in having a student
 
04:12:05.710 --> 04:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
suicide on campus uh it was very very
 
04:12:07.389 --> 04:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
difficult it was very very difficult for
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
for all of the students it was difficult
 
04:12:12.830 --> 04:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
obviously for the family of this student
 
04:12:15.309 --> 04:12:15.319 align:start position:0%
uh and I have been talking to them and
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
continue to be in touch with them uh
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
over the past year what I can tell you
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
is we take this very seriously and have
 
04:12:24.670 --> 04:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
been addressing the issue so two and a
 
04:12:27.149 --> 04:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
half years ago Plymouth State University
 
04:12:29.070 --> 04:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh became a part of an organization
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
called the Jed Jed campus the Jed
 
04:12:35.030 --> 04:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
Foundation is uh an organization a
 
04:12:36.670 --> 04:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that was founded
 
04:12:39.389 --> 04:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
about a decade Ago by uh a Silicon
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
Valley uh executive and his wife whose
 
04:12:45.790 --> 04:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
son Jed died by suicide on a Texas
 
04:12:48.510 --> 04:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
college campus they dedicated a great
 
04:12:51.670 --> 04:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
deal of time and significant resources
 
04:12:53.790 --> 04:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
to starting this Foundation which is
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
based purely upon helping colleges and
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
universities deal with and promote the
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
mental health of students Plymouth State
 
04:13:03.870 --> 04:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
University signed on with the Jed
 
04:13:05.950 --> 04:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
Foundation two and a half years ago that
 
04:13:08.149 --> 04:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
began a three-year process with them and
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
at the end of this year in
 
04:13:14.189 --> 04:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
2023 we will be a Jed certified campus
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
there're about 133 Jed certified
 
04:13:19.070 --> 04:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
campuses across the country UNH is a Jed
 
04:13:20.830 --> 04:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
certified campus and now Plymouth state
 
04:13:22.710 --> 04:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
will be as well what that means is we
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
had a team from the Jed Foundation come
 
04:13:27.149 --> 04:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
into campus two and a half years ago
 
04:13:30.149 --> 04:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
they sat with uh a steering committee
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
that was made up of Faculty staff
 
04:13:33.870 --> 04:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
community members from the town of
 
04:13:35.790 --> 04:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
Plymouth often times our students are
 
04:13:37.710 --> 04:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
employed and live off campus so they're
 
04:13:39.550 --> 04:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with the community uh and
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
students themselves and parents they sat
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
with us they looked at everything we
 
04:13:45.309 --> 04:13:45.319 align:start position:0%
were doing and then they came back with
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations on what we should
 
04:13:49.469 --> 04:13:49.479 align:start position:0%
Implement over the next three years we
 
04:13:51.149 --> 04:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
have begun implementing those
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations and I'm here to tell you
 
04:13:54.510 --> 04:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
that a couple of them have been very
 
04:13:57.309 --> 04:13:57.319 align:start position:0%
successful uh and not only that we are
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
actually looking at how successful they
 
04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
are from the data so when the Jed
 
04:14:02.910 --> 04:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
Foundation came one of the first things
 
04:14:05.269 --> 04:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
we did was what's called an the Healthy
 
04:14:07.309 --> 04:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
Mind survey which is done through the
 
04:14:09.109 --> 04:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
University of Michigan it's a national
 
04:14:11.710 --> 04:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
survey on college student mental health
 
04:14:13.389 --> 04:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
that was sent out to all of our students
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
we had about 66% response rate which is
 
04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
very high for a survey sent to college
 
04:14:19.630 --> 04:14:19.640 align:start position:0%
students probably high for survey sent
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
to anyone um but they identified the
 
04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
needs that they had they identified
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
where they had found help for those
 
04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
needs and what else they needed one of
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
the also one of the important things was
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
they identified for us how easy or hard
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
it was for them to access the services
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
that we offered we took the results of
 
04:14:41.950 --> 04:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
that survey and began to implement the
 
04:14:43.990 --> 04:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the Jed Foundation
 
04:14:45.870 --> 04:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
the number one recommendation of the Jed
 
04:14:49.269 --> 04:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
Foundation was that we do a better job
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
of promoting the services that we have
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
so we adopted at their recommendation uh
 
04:14:57.750 --> 04:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
an a phone app obviously that's what a
 
04:14:59.229 --> 04:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
college student needs it's called
 
04:15:02.429 --> 04:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
wellcheck it's a national app uh that's
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh supported by the Jed foundation and
 
04:15:06.550 --> 04:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
we launched that last spring and about
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
71 % of our students right now have
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
downloaded The Well Check app they use
 
04:15:13.389 --> 04:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
it on their phone and it's really a
 
04:15:16.469 --> 04:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
self-help app but also provides
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities for them to learn about
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
mental health opportunities across
 
04:15:23.229 --> 04:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
campus so it sends them uh they check in
 
04:15:24.910 --> 04:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
and they can check their basically a
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
wellness check every day that's for
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
their own right and it tells you if you
 
04:15:29.710 --> 04:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
if you're at this level you ought to
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
think about going to a stress release uh
 
04:15:34.269 --> 04:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh opportunity that we have maybe you
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
want to go take a yoga class but most
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
importantly every day it goes out to
 
04:15:41.149 --> 04:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
those students here's what's happening
 
04:15:43.790 --> 04:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
today related to mental and emotional
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
well-being and it also is a way for them
 
04:15:48.309 --> 04:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
to contact directly our Counseling
 
04:15:51.870 --> 04:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
Center uh and we are pleased our
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
students are using that and we can also
 
04:15:55.990 --> 04:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
check that app if they give us
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
permission to see how they're doing and
 
04:15:59.950 --> 04:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful for our counselors
 
04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
who are seeing students on a regular
 
04:16:04.510 --> 04:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
basis uh at our Counseling Center the
 
04:16:06.389 --> 04:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
second thing we did was we did what was
 
04:16:09.389 --> 04:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
called fres check day it's a national uh
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
day that is uh recommended to happen on
 
04:16:14.109 --> 04:16:14.119 align:start position:0%
the very first day of classes on any
 
04:16:16.429 --> 04:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
college campus and it's basically a day
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
when classes start where we focus on
 
04:16:21.030 --> 04:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
mental health and we had about 1,600
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
students attend our first fresh check
 
04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
day last August 31st the day classes
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
started the idea being that it's a a
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
kind of a fair if you will and students
 
04:16:33.389 --> 04:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
uh can go and talk to and see all of the
 
04:16:35.309 --> 04:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
various resources that are happening
 
04:16:36.910 --> 04:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
there um we were able to get our
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
athletes involved in that so all that
 
04:16:44.109 --> 04:16:44.119 align:start position:0%
e efforts and again the idea is we care
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
so much about this that we're going to
 
04:16:48.030 --> 04:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
emphasize it on the very first day
 
04:16:50.349 --> 04:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
classes begin it was very successful and
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
we'll be doing that again uh and then
 
04:16:54.389 --> 04:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
the final thing that uh we'll be doing
 
04:16:56.790 --> 04:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
is we'll be doing another uh Healthy
 
04:16:59.830 --> 04:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
Mind survey that will go out this spring
 
04:17:02.189 --> 04:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
and it will look at the difference what
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
we see in the difference of all of the
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
things we've done in the last two and a
 
04:17:08.070 --> 04:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
half years to what students are seeing
 
04:17:10.030 --> 04:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
today and I think that's going to be
 
04:17:12.109 --> 04:17:12.119 align:start position:0%
really important for us and part of the
 
04:17:14.710 --> 04:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
Jed campus program is that we will do
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
that Healthy Mind survey every two years
 
04:17:20.189 --> 04:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
uh and we are committed to doing that
 
04:17:21.630 --> 04:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
and then I know in this bill IT
 
04:17:23.830 --> 04:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue of reaching out to
 
04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
and and having contracts with local
 
04:17:28.870 --> 04:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
providers very very important um I'm not
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
sure that having that prescripted in a
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation makes the most
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
sense but I can tell you and I sit on
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
the board of the Lakes Region Mental
 
04:17:39.030 --> 04:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
Health uh organization and they are one
 
04:17:40.870 --> 04:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
of our partners that we've used for
 
04:17:42.870 --> 04:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
years we have a very successful
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
relationship with them uh our Counseling
 
04:17:48.750 --> 04:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
Center uh already um you know recommends
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
students and and actually makes
 
04:17:53.109 --> 04:17:53.119 align:start position:0%
referrals directly to counselors and
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
therapists and support groups that are
 
04:17:57.790 --> 04:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
part of lakes Region's mental health and
 
04:17:59.590 --> 04:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
that program has been very successful it
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
allows our students to literally walk
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
across campus across Highland Street
 
04:18:07.030 --> 04:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
into the Plymouth uh office of Lakes
 
04:18:08.950 --> 04:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
Region mental health so it's really
 
04:18:10.590 --> 04:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
connected to our campus from that
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint so I think it's important for
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
you to know what we are doing that we
 
04:18:16.750 --> 04:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
have students who are very active in
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
this uh and and I believe we are working
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
hard to move to the next level and I can
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
tell you that both keen and UNH are on
 
04:18:28.349 --> 04:18:28.359 align:start position:0%
that same track happy to answer any
 
04:18:30.550 --> 04:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
questions anyone might have are there
 
04:18:33.309 --> 04:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
any questions yes
 
04:18:36.990 --> 04:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do you do any
 
04:18:42.349 --> 04:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
training of your staff or we do for
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
residential uh counselors and and
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
particularly in mental health for St yes
 
04:18:49.349 --> 04:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
so right right today actually I think
 
04:18:52.229 --> 04:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
this afternoon at three o'clock our uh
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
our our residents life team is back on
 
04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
campus right classes start next Tuesday
 
04:18:59.790 --> 04:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
so all of our uh resident uh life teams
 
04:19:01.550 --> 04:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
including the community directors who
 
04:19:02.910 --> 04:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
the professional staff that live in the
 
04:19:04.750 --> 04:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
building and all of the community
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
advisers who live in the floor are
 
04:19:08.429 --> 04:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
getting Mental Health First Aid training
 
04:19:10.030 --> 04:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and that we do that in
 
04:19:12.309 --> 04:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
cooperation with nami uh and we do that
 
04:19:13.950 --> 04:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
in cooperation with Lakes Region mental
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
health in addition our student facing
 
04:19:19.389 --> 04:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
professional staff so that would include
 
04:19:21.030 --> 04:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
folks in the registar folks in the
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
dining hall folks in uh you know Student
 
04:19:26.149 --> 04:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
Life they all get suicide prevention
 
04:19:28.590 --> 04:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
training as well because our uh the Jed
 
04:19:31.630 --> 04:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
Foundation has told us be surprised the
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
people that are most likely to see that
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
a student might be struggling it's a
 
04:19:37.830 --> 04:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
cafeteria worker and a building service
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
worker the person that cleans the floor
 
04:19:42.550 --> 04:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
so you get to see them every morning and
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
the person that serves you breakfast
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
lunch and dinner so we've gone to Great
 
04:19:47.309 --> 04:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
Lengths to make sure that they're part
 
04:19:50.670 --> 04:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
of our team and are trained as
 
04:19:53.870 --> 04:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
well go ahead so I think that that's
 
04:19:55.710 --> 04:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
it's a good segue just kind of some of
 
04:19:57.030 --> 04:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
the concerns we have with the
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
legislation so by our count the bill
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
probably would mandate somewhere around
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
a dozen requirements on the state's
 
04:20:05.070 --> 04:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
public colleges and universities in
 
04:20:06.830 --> 04:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
preparation for this hearing work with
 
04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
Marlin and others to prepare for this
 
04:20:09.870 --> 04:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
hearing we did go through those right
 
04:20:11.670 --> 04:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
and we think we're in a good position on
 
04:20:14.149 --> 04:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
many of them already um that's a great
 
04:20:15.630 --> 04:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
example you've heard Marlin talk about
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
websites You' heard him talk about uh
 
04:20:20.670 --> 04:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
orientation about uh surveys we are
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
doing those in some degree at some
 
04:20:25.550 --> 04:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
variation on all of our campuses we do e
 
04:20:27.229 --> 04:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
and flow based on what we think works
 
04:20:29.070 --> 04:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
and what doesn't and that's important we
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
think to our ability to continue to
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
address this issue amongst our student
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
body we one concern for example is the
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
bill necessitates uh are evaluating
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
these programs but then doesn't give us
 
04:20:41.510 --> 04:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to stop doing stuff that
 
04:20:43.950 --> 04:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't work in favor of things that do
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
um so that's one of one of our concerns
 
04:20:47.309 --> 04:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
uh if I could quickly a couple others
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
the bill speaks the idea of an expert
 
04:20:50.950 --> 04:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
panel um that would be required at each
 
04:20:52.469 --> 04:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
of either the schools or at the the
 
04:20:53.750 --> 04:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
board of trustee level that wasn't
 
04:20:56.429 --> 04:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
entirely clear but either way it sort of
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
is seeming to suggest we need an extra
 
04:21:00.910 --> 04:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
layer of attention on top of the good
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
work that's already going on on each of
 
04:21:04.109 --> 04:21:04.119 align:start position:0%
the campuses certainly more help is
 
04:21:06.109 --> 04:21:06.119 align:start position:0%
always nice but as we've heard multiple
 
04:21:07.790 --> 04:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
times in the committee and other places
 
04:21:09.429 --> 04:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
we do focus on administrative burden if
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
we think we're doing the job well
 
04:21:13.469 --> 04:21:13.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's not again a great use of
 
04:21:15.309 --> 04:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
of funds strategic Partnerships we've
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
talked about a couple of times things we
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
we want to do we do I think do at many
 
04:21:22.830 --> 04:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
of our campuses shortages of providers
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
is clear um as much as it would be great
 
04:21:26.710 --> 04:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
to have them uh we can't make them
 
04:21:28.830 --> 04:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
appear out of thin air um and at the
 
04:21:30.910 --> 04:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
same time in other cases we try and stop
 
04:21:33.790 --> 04:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit short of formal contractual
 
04:21:36.429 --> 04:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
obligations with providers out of
 
04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
concern for conf conflict of interest
 
04:21:40.030 --> 04:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
appearances of favoritism and other
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
concerns like that and this bill would
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
actually not only require us to contract
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
but then open up our student bodies to
 
04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
advertising and otherwise from some of
 
04:21:48.670 --> 04:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
these external groups which is a little
 
04:21:50.550 --> 04:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
bit of a concern uh I think it might
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
have been representative Woodcock
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
earlier asked a question about private
 
04:21:55.070 --> 04:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
colleg universities this bill does not
 
04:21:56.550 --> 04:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
apply to the private colleges
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
universities in the state um they are
 
04:22:00.149 --> 04:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
obviously uh facing this issue in the
 
04:22:02.189 --> 04:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
same way we are and I'm sure our just as
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
dedicated to it um but that might be a a
 
04:22:07.109 --> 04:22:07.119 align:start position:0%
question and obviously there's no fiscal
 
04:22:09.109 --> 04:22:09.119 align:start position:0%
support in this bill right now our
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I think was about a quarter
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year um to go beyond
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
where we are right now I know shanon
 
04:22:15.790 --> 04:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned Community College syst was
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
much higher um that is obviously a
 
04:22:20.910 --> 04:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
concern and the fact that it will force
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
us again to do a prescriptive set of
 
04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
things at more money than we are
 
04:22:26.670 --> 04:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
spending now and not give us the
 
04:22:29.229 --> 04:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
flexibility to adjust as we we we hope
 
04:22:32.030 --> 04:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
we could uh down the line uh maybe just
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
to close you know representative luno
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
asked a good question about where this
 
04:22:36.429 --> 04:22:36.439 align:start position:0%
could go uh I think there was a
 
04:22:38.309 --> 04:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
committee or a commission a couple years
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
ago perhaps I think actually
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Corell you might have
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
chaired it looking at this exact issue
 
04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
in K through 12 schools certainly that
 
04:22:46.349 --> 04:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
is something I think we would love to
 
04:22:48.070 --> 04:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
participate in would love to bring the
 
04:22:49.950 --> 04:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
private college universities along with
 
04:22:51.750 --> 04:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
community college system and have those
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
conversations and really think about
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
what are the discreet focused areas
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
where either we aren't maybe meeting
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
what we'd like to we'd like to be able
 
04:23:00.030 --> 04:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
to do more and how do we work together
 
04:23:01.710 --> 04:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
as a state to make those Partnerships
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
happen that can be successful for all of
 
04:23:05.590 --> 04:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
our students but one that is a little
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
bit more focused and a little bit more
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
tailored to where we all agree there is
 
04:23:11.910 --> 04:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
a need um so maybe with that I'll stop
 
04:23:13.109 --> 04:23:13.119 align:start position:0%
it again I know we're a little over but
 
04:23:15.550 --> 04:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
happy to answer Mr Cronin and and Mr
 
04:23:18.670 --> 04:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
Collingwood I I have a question on your
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
handout you've provided us on a second
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
page going down several paragraphs it
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
reads in conducting a survey of campuses
 
04:23:29.870 --> 04:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
in preparation for this hearing we
 
04:23:31.710 --> 04:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
established that we are meeting or
 
04:23:34.030 --> 04:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
exceeding nearly all of the requirements
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
already then you drop down a couple
 
04:23:40.269 --> 04:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
sentences the only way to reallocate
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
resources to evolving best practices
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
will be through changes in State law can
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
you please identify what you mean by
 
04:23:51.670 --> 04:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
best practices and what would have to be
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
changed in state law is it finances or
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
is it some other statutory area that
 
04:23:58.510 --> 04:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
we've been dealing like with earlier
 
04:24:00.790 --> 04:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
today sorry so to be clear that is
 
04:24:03.710 --> 04:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
assuming 1648 passed so if 1648 would
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
pass and say these are all the things
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
you must do to address student mental
 
04:24:10.030 --> 04:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
health if we were to see for example
 
04:24:12.349 --> 04:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
that I think Keen state may have offered
 
04:24:13.790 --> 04:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
an example where they for a while were
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
doing a student survey they were getting
 
04:24:18.670 --> 04:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
very low turnout on that survey Marlin
 
04:24:20.149 --> 04:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
pointing out 60 something percent is
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
outstanding when you get below a certain
 
04:24:24.269 --> 04:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
threshold surveys are no longer valuable
 
04:24:25.750 --> 04:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
Keen was paying for this survey they
 
04:24:27.510 --> 04:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to get this information it wasn't
 
04:24:29.229 --> 04:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
working for them they discontinued use
 
04:24:30.590 --> 04:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
of it we would not be allowed to
 
04:24:32.429 --> 04:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
discontinue use of a survey like that
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
should 1648 become one so on followup
 
04:24:37.349 --> 04:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
they just trying to get some
 
04:24:40.469 --> 04:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
clarifications on this changes in state
 
04:24:43.349 --> 04:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
law what would be changed in state law
 
04:24:46.750 --> 04:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
adopting this or sorry yeah I apologize
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
there's confusion this testimony is
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
essentially saying if you were to adopt
 
04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
1648 it would then take us changes in
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
state law we'd have to go back and amend
 
04:24:58.870 --> 04:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
1648 as is now Statute in order to do
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
things differently than what the bill
 
04:25:03.030 --> 04:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
prescribes we do right now we don't need
 
04:25:04.710 --> 04:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
any changes in state law and we'd rather
 
04:25:06.429 --> 04:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
we didn't put these prescriptive requir
 
04:25:08.510 --> 04:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
into state law but if we did put
 
04:25:10.229 --> 04:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
prescriptive requirements in state law
 
04:25:11.429 --> 04:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
we feel like we would need to go back
 
04:25:14.349 --> 04:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
and ask you to say Keen is not having
 
04:25:15.670 --> 04:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
success with the survey we'd like to not
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
do it anymore but law says we have to
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
right now we do not have that problem
 
04:25:21.790 --> 04:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
04:25:24.670 --> 04:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
questions per and lak
 
04:25:27.830 --> 04:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
US yes thank you can you tell me what
 
04:25:30.630 --> 04:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
the name of that phone app is and do you
 
04:25:32.349 --> 04:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
have to be a college
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
student uh well you do have to be you
 
04:25:36.510 --> 04:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
have to have a Plymouth state email
 
04:25:38.269 --> 04:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
address to be able to use it but it's
 
04:25:43.109 --> 04:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
called wellcheck w l c c and you can
 
04:25:46.109 --> 04:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
look it up and find it online uh and uh
 
04:25:47.830 --> 04:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
but if you had a Ply State email address
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
I could let you be a member right now
 
04:25:53.950 --> 04:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:56.750 --> 04:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
much Cornell Thank you thank you for
 
04:25:58.910 --> 04:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question is Plymouth the only
 
04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
one that's doing the the well check in
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
the app or so so Plymouth State and Keen
 
04:26:08.109 --> 04:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
State both use well Che right now I know
 
04:26:09.950 --> 04:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
that UNH has a different app that you're
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
using I'm not sure which which it is uh
 
04:26:15.269 --> 04:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
and then I know that uh uh univers uh
 
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire went through
 
04:26:19.510 --> 04:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
the Jed process about four years ago I
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if Keen State's looking at
 
04:26:23.109 --> 04:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
that or not but I do know and I guess
 
04:26:24.870 --> 04:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would say to emphasize
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
what Tom said not only is is this going
 
04:26:30.349 --> 04:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
to require you know the the system to do
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
everything it's also going to require
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
each campus to do things the same and
 
04:26:35.630 --> 04:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't work for us um I have a
 
04:26:39.309 --> 04:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
very different student body um 53% of my
 
04:26:41.070 --> 04:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
students are first generation college
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
students every year 55% of them are
 
04:26:45.429 --> 04:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
fully pel eligible which mean they come
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
from a very lowincome families they have
 
04:26:50.030 --> 04:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
very different mental health needs than
 
04:26:52.349 --> 04:26:52.359 align:start position:0%
the students might have at UNH or at
 
04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
keen and we need to be able to have the
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility to do what works not just
 
04:26:58.429 --> 04:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
for everybody but that works
 
04:27:01.630 --> 04:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
specifically and is prescriptive to our
 
04:27:04.710 --> 04:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
campus and I think you said you follow
 
04:27:08.349 --> 04:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
up I said you had a partnership withouth
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
um Mental Health Center with the Lakes
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
Region mental health yes yes and I think
 
04:27:15.309 --> 04:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
un Manchester I think one with the
 
04:27:17.550 --> 04:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
mental health C Manchester yes and I
 
04:27:19.510 --> 04:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
know Keen State I believe has a similar
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
partnership but again they work for us
 
04:27:24.189 --> 04:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
right this bill would really make those
 
04:27:27.109 --> 04:27:27.119 align:start position:0%
would for be the best for our
 
04:27:31.590 --> 04:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:31.600 --> 04:27:33.710 align:start position:0%
 
have

04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:27:39.189 --> 04:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:41.269 --> 04:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
providers relationships how those
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
relationships are they Contra are they
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
we agree this is a good place to set
 
04:27:47.670 --> 04:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
services to but instead of being one of
 
04:27:50.070 --> 04:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
sort of mutual partnership legislation
 
04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
forces us into it when may only have few
 
04:27:56.429 --> 04:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
Ops and no matter whe what having a
 
04:27:58.269 --> 04:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
partnership there's still a lack of
 
04:27:59.630 --> 04:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
Provider so even if you have a
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
partnership doesn't mean that somebody's
 
04:28:04.910 --> 04:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
going to get to that's right thank you
 
04:28:07.229 --> 04:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
yes representa Mullen then represent
 
04:28:12.750 --> 04:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
wood thank you very much Mr chair and
 
04:28:15.870 --> 04:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
thank you again gentlemen um Mr Cronin I
 
04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
can hear the pride in Mr collingwood's
 
04:28:23.109 --> 04:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
voice about what's happening at Plymouth
 
04:28:26.189 --> 04:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
State uh I have a two-part question one
 
04:28:29.229 --> 04:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
is uh is there someone in the University
 
04:28:33.149 --> 04:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
system that oversees the mental health
 
04:28:36.109 --> 04:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
of all if you will to determine whether
 
04:28:40.830 --> 04:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
or not keen and UNH and UNH Manchester
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
are equally as proud of what they're
 
04:28:45.630 --> 04:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
doing in mental health
 
04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
services and um I if there is not how do
 
04:28:52.750 --> 04:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
the colleges
 
04:28:55.389 --> 04:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
determine what needs Plymouth has as
 
04:28:57.510 --> 04:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to what needs Keane and and
 
04:28:57.520 --> 04:28:58.630 align:start position:0%
opposed to what needs Keane and and
Durham

04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
Durham
 
04:29:01.030 --> 04:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
have yeah I'm happy to address that if
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
if that's okay so um yes me student
 
04:29:06.510 --> 04:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
mental health is an important agenda
 
04:29:08.550 --> 04:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
item every time we have a board of
 
04:29:10.910 --> 04:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
trustees meeting uh it falls under the
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
academic academic Excellence committee
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
and from that group there is a group of
 
04:29:21.070 --> 04:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
uh Student Life team that meets monthly
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
it's a steering committee that's made up
 
04:29:26.469 --> 04:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
of um my counterparts and actually the
 
04:29:28.750 --> 04:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
heads of our counseling centers and so
 
04:29:31.750 --> 04:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
we meet monthly and we share resources
 
04:29:34.349 --> 04:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
we share best practices we talk about
 
04:29:36.950 --> 04:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
specific issues we might be be having uh
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
and so it's uh it's been that's been
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
around for about a year and a half now
 
04:29:43.030 --> 04:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
and uh that committee has worked really
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
well for us to be able to really know
 
04:29:47.469 --> 04:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
what uh I mean for instance you know
 
04:29:49.870 --> 04:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of what we're doing that
 
04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh my counterparts at keen and un have
 
04:29:53.550 --> 04:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
said we want to come up and see about
 
04:29:54.870 --> 04:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to look at a fresh check
 
04:29:56.870 --> 04:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
day how do we do that so representative
 
04:30:04.510 --> 04:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
groupes yes thank you brother thank you
 
04:30:08.910 --> 04:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
gentlemen for taking my question Mr
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
calling with I will reiterate as my
 
04:30:13.070 --> 04:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
friend to the right here said thank you
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
so much I appreciate your uh positive
 
04:30:17.229 --> 04:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
and enthusiastic support in such a
 
04:30:19.309 --> 04:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
difficult topic uh just one very little
 
04:30:23.550 --> 04:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
small piece that uh the panther place or
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
the other colleges around the state do
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
they um you have any peer support groups
 
04:30:30.710 --> 04:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
I know that the the uh originator of
 
04:30:32.109 --> 04:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
legislation was looking primarily for
 
04:30:34.189 --> 04:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
peer support I didn't hear you mention
 
04:30:38.149 --> 04:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
that in your things or just just quick
 
04:30:41.950 --> 04:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
piece so uh um I will say this we do not
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
um peer support groups are not
 
04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily the best kind of support
 
04:30:48.630 --> 04:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
groups for mental health okay um unlike
 
04:30:50.510 --> 04:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics
 
04:30:52.469 --> 04:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
Anonymous uh in which you come in and
 
04:30:55.070 --> 04:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
you share um uh the same experiences
 
04:30:57.149 --> 04:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
right with different different details
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
oftentimes mental health uh issues are
 
04:31:01.710 --> 04:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
very different and and not something
 
04:31:03.389 --> 04:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
that you're willing or wanting to share
 
04:31:06.189 --> 04:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
with a group I believe that any peer
 
04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
peer support groups that would happen
 
04:31:10.349 --> 04:31:10.359 align:start position:0%
would we would want them to have a
 
04:31:13.149 --> 04:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
professional that is running them which
 
04:31:15.429 --> 04:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
then becomes another issue in which I
 
04:31:17.469 --> 04:31:17.479 align:start position:0%
have you know six counselors at my
 
04:31:19.590 --> 04:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
Counseling Center who are literally
 
04:31:22.349 --> 04:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
filled up with one-on-one appointments
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
um we do do peer groups but they're not
 
04:31:27.309 --> 04:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily support groups we do peer
 
04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
groups on um breathing techniques we do
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
peer groups on anti how to how to how to
 
04:31:35.189 --> 04:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
get rid of your anxiety those kinds of
 
04:31:37.510 --> 04:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
things but it's very different to have a
 
04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
peer support group that's literally
 
04:31:41.750 --> 04:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
having 10 people who are depressed come
 
04:31:44.269 --> 04:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
in and talk to each other that tends not
 
04:31:49.550 --> 04:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
to be a a a really um
 
04:31:53.309 --> 04:31:53.319 align:start position:0%
medical advice kind of situation that's
 
04:31:55.030 --> 04:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
very different from a group of people
 
04:31:57.750 --> 04:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
who have cancer or who have and it's not
 
04:31:59.030 --> 04:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
something that's actually recommended
 
04:32:01.149 --> 04:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
very highly thank you very much thank
 
04:32:04.269 --> 04:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
you repr I appreciate it represent
 
04:32:06.670 --> 04:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
Hopson thank you thank you Mr chair and
 
04:32:08.510 --> 04:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Collingwood and Mr
 
04:32:11.510 --> 04:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
Cronin for your testimony today I wasn't
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
sure if I should uh bring this up or not
 
04:32:16.670 --> 04:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's um I wanted to know if uh Mr Cronin
 
04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
if you were familiar with um the uh UNH
 
04:32:24.469 --> 04:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry just lost it here shoot um I
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
think it was the um department of
 
04:32:29.070 --> 04:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
disability there's a woman there Heidi
 
04:32:32.070 --> 04:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
cluder who is working with one of my
 
04:32:34.990 --> 04:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
constituents um they have a recovery
 
04:32:37.469 --> 04:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
it's live free recovery and they have a
 
04:32:41.309 --> 04:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer group support already in
 
04:32:44.389 --> 04:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
place for substance abuse and
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
co-occurring situations so I don't know
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
if it's applicable or if it's a a
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
structure that you might want to look at
 
04:32:54.429 --> 04:32:54.439 align:start position:0%
but have you heard of that before so I
 
04:32:56.510 --> 04:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
have vaguely heard of the work the IOD
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
is doing on this issue and I think it's
 
04:32:59.790 --> 04:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
a good opportunity to follow up on
 
04:33:01.550 --> 04:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
Martin's or Marlin's answer the last
 
04:33:03.030 --> 04:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
question and a couple questions from the
 
04:33:05.709 --> 04:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
representatives you know I think of the
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities we have at the University
 
04:33:09.070 --> 04:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
right now or un system right now is
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
three very different campuses located in
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
three distinct regions of the state all
 
04:33:15.070 --> 04:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
with different student bodies all again
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
recognizing the sincere importance of
 
04:33:19.390 --> 04:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
this issue but being able to come at it
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
from a few different directions have
 
04:33:23.310 --> 04:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
conversations up to the Board of
 
04:33:25.390 --> 04:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
Trustees level on down through various
 
04:33:26.830 --> 04:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
committees and then student affairs
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
executive committee working hand and
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
glove to try and understand what each of
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
our universities is doing to tackle this
 
04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
issue so I do think there are peer
 
04:33:37.949 --> 04:33:37.959 align:start position:0%
support uh groups on both keen and I
 
04:33:39.789 --> 04:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
know at UNH we recently started a
 
04:33:40.990 --> 04:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
program and we're trying to see how it
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
fares so what we're that group is going
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
to do is come back and say all right
 
04:33:45.670 --> 04:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
this worked this is what the research
 
04:33:47.070 --> 04:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
says this is what best practice and
 
04:33:48.910 --> 04:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
evidence say this is the suggestion for
 
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
how we go forward I don't think there's
 
04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
a civil Silver Bullet solution to this
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
and I think we probably would say sure
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
if money and resources were no option
 
04:33:58.510 --> 04:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
we'd love to do all of it and throw it
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
all at the wall that's not reality
 
04:34:02.310 --> 04:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
however and instead we're in a place
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
where we're trying
 
04:34:04.279 --> 04:34:05.789 align:start position:0%
where we're trying
standing

04:34:05.789 --> 04:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
standing
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
best practices and what we're hearing
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
from our students and families Works um
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
so I think that is hopefully a response
 
04:34:13.230 --> 04:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
to to all those questions on on how we'd
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
like to proceed and again a chance to
 
04:34:17.470 --> 04:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
talk in more detail through a study
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
commission or otherwise I think you
 
04:34:22.029 --> 04:34:22.039 align:start position:0%
would likely hear colleagues at Plymouth
 
04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
Kean UNH many of the Community College
 
04:34:25.830 --> 04:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
systems many of the private universities
 
04:34:27.629 --> 04:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
in the state all with the same passion
 
04:34:29.709 --> 04:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
Marlin has for this issue uh coming in
 
04:34:31.709 --> 04:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
to talk about some ways we can try and
 
04:34:34.269 --> 04:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
make it better for
 
04:34:34.279 --> 04:34:35.990 align:start position:0%
make it better for
everyone

04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
Tom I got one last question here further
 
04:34:41.709 --> 04:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
reading your letter here uh you must
 
04:34:43.830 --> 04:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
have done some kind of a national search
 
04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
to find out what's going on throughout
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
the country in regard to this horrible
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
issue it says uh this has been a
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
challenge in Illinois where the bill
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
passed in late
 
04:34:58.269 --> 04:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
2019 but has not been funded leaving
 
04:34:59.949 --> 04:34:59.959 align:start position:0%
campuses in
 
04:35:03.470 --> 04:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
alert uh did you see any other states
 
04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
which have passed this and successful in
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
implementing is the is the money you go
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
on the next PA it's basically a money
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
issue um what's the situation throughout
 
04:35:17.150 --> 04:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
other than Illinois here so really just
 
04:35:18.590 --> 04:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
some Googling around trying to
 
04:35:21.310 --> 04:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
understand the origins of the bill um
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
the way the language was written did
 
04:35:23.709 --> 04:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
seem pretty prescriptive and made me
 
04:35:24.670 --> 04:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
think that perhaps there were other
 
04:35:26.551 --> 04:35:26.561 align:start position:0%
states looking at this I saw Illinois
 
04:35:27.709 --> 04:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
was sort of the one state that had
 
04:35:30.070 --> 04:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
passed it again a couple years ago and
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
and now they have yet to fund it um I
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
think it might have been proposed in New
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
Jersey but please don't hold me to that
 
04:35:37.709 --> 04:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
uh again it was kind of just the first
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
few things that came up on a Google
 
04:35:41.470 --> 04:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
search thank you are there further
 
04:35:44.429 --> 04:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
questions for the University system
 
04:35:48.269 --> 04:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:54.310 --> 04:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:59.230 --> 04:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
Mike is representative Eric Gallagher
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
here or he's not a
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
representative yes he is yes he is
 
04:36:04.119 --> 04:36:06.070 align:start position:0%
representative yes he is yes he is
co-sponsor

04:36:06.070 --> 04:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
04:36:11.109 --> 04:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
yeah welcome Eric hi um yeah I'm Eric
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
gagher ma 15 that's conquered w six and
 
04:36:20.670 --> 04:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
um so I don't really have as much to say
 
04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
in um the way of specific wordings that
 
04:36:26.910 --> 04:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
the previous testifiers were talking
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
about I'm mostly just here to share my
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
personal story of why I support this
 
04:36:34.799 --> 04:36:35.949 align:start position:0%
personal story of why I support this
bill

04:36:35.949 --> 04:36:35.959 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:36:39.189 --> 04:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
so I went to George Washington
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
University in DC from 2009 to 2013 and
 
04:36:46.189 --> 04:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
while I was there I
 
04:36:48.670 --> 04:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
developed some mental health conditions
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
of my own and um there was a university
 
04:36:54.510 --> 04:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
Counseling Center I was able to receive
 
04:36:54.520 --> 04:36:56.029 align:start position:0%
Counseling Center I was able to receive
counseling

04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
04:37:01.029 --> 04:37:01.039 align:start position:0%
services and um able to get a diagnosis
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
and that enabled me to get the resources
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
I needed for from the disability Center
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
at the
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
college um to be able to graduate
 
04:37:13.199 --> 04:37:14.869 align:start position:0%
college um to be able to graduate
successfully

04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
and just my
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
main pieces of feedback I'd give to that
 
04:37:28.470 --> 04:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
experience was just how isolating it was
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
to be being just one onone with a
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
counselor if I hadn't known
 
04:37:37.709 --> 04:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
that there were other
 
04:37:40.990 --> 04:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
people at my college who were going
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
through the same thing as me and that we
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
could exchange tips with and commiserate
 
04:37:51.230 --> 04:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
with each other that um with also there
 
04:37:54.189 --> 04:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
being a counselor there at the same time
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
I think that would have
 
04:38:00.551 --> 04:38:00.561 align:start position:0%
been a lot more helpful than just trying
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
to work through it work through it all
 
04:38:06.349 --> 04:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
all by myself um so one question might
 
04:38:06.359 --> 04:38:07.990 align:start position:0%
all by myself um so one question might
be

04:38:07.990 --> 04:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:38:12.150 --> 04:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
um well why why peer support groups
 
04:38:14.429 --> 04:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
specifically for University students why
 
04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
not just send them
 
04:38:20.990 --> 04:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
to existing mental health support groups
 
04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
out in the
 
04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
community um so after returning
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
home I I actually tried that I tried um
 
04:38:34.510 --> 04:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
signing up for a support group through
 
04:38:39.230 --> 04:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
River band uh here and conquered
 
04:38:42.670 --> 04:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
and it was not a group of my peers it
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:48.990 --> 04:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
mostly it it was it it um people people
 
04:38:51.551 --> 04:38:51.561 align:start position:0%
in the general public with mental
 
04:38:54.349 --> 04:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
illness and um mental health issues um
 
04:38:58.590 --> 04:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
tend not to to have the exact same
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
problems as the mental health problems
 
04:39:06.269 --> 04:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
that college can create so that's why
 
04:39:09.670 --> 04:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
um that's why I think it would be good
 
04:39:11.629 --> 04:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
to have peer support groups specifically
 
04:39:14.830 --> 04:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
for college students so that way they
 
04:39:18.269 --> 04:39:18.279 align:start position:0%
can understand the help help each other
 
04:39:20.310 --> 04:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
with the problems relate specifically to
 
04:39:23.429 --> 04:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
college that people from the rest of the
 
04:39:26.949 --> 04:39:26.959 align:start position:0%
public might not necessarily be
 
04:39:29.310 --> 04:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
experiencing um
 
04:39:31.830 --> 04:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's about all I have to say
 
04:39:34.230 --> 04:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions thank you
 
04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative not see any hands thank
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:52.670 --> 04:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any further folks in
 
04:39:54.788 --> 04:39:54.798 align:start position:0%

hearing and we're going to take a short
 
04:40:04.350 --> 04:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
four or five minute break so we can all
 
04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
get up stretch
 
04:40:09.310 --> 04:40:09.320 align:start position:0%

andv I I'm
 
04:42:35.628 --> 04:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
thinking study might motion for that
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:03.480 --> 04:43:33.470 align:start position:0%

04:45:03.280 --> 04:45:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:45:32.390 --> 04:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.390 --> 04:45:34.400 align:start position:0%

04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
1313 I'll just read this quickly and be
 
04:45:44.430 --> 04:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
done with it so we can get going yeah
 
04:45:47.070 --> 04:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we fell a little bit behind yeah
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
well the afternoon I expect to with some
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
of these bills
 
04:45:51.200 --> 04:45:54.830 align:start position:0%
of these bills
yeah

04:45:54.830 --> 04:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
so school facility planning and
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%

04:46:08.830 --> 04:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
really we're having a hard time funding
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.110 --> 04:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thinking on that last I wouldn't I
 
04:46:23.310 --> 04:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
could see an in study motion so we could
 
04:46:25.470 --> 04:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
always come back and revisit that you
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
know later in the spring or something
 
04:46:29.670 --> 04:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
and see you know what's
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
happening see the the last
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill yeah that has to final does it yeah
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%

e

04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.760 --> 04:51:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
spe

04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.760 --> 04:52:01.070 align:start position:0%
 
there

04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%

stated in the Bill the law further
 
04:53:07.628 --> 04:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
states that an individual by virtue of
 
04:53:09.510 --> 04:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
certain identifying conditions such as
 
04:53:12.030 --> 04:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
the color of one's skin is inherently
 
04:53:14.350 --> 04:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
racist sexist or oppressive whether
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
consciously or
 
04:53:18.750 --> 04:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
unconsciously the law does not prohibit
 
04:53:21.070 --> 04:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
discussing as a part of a larger course
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%

04:53:25.948 --> 04:53:25.958 align:start position:0%
existence of ideas and subjects

identified in this section HB 1313 adds
 
04:53:32.750 --> 04:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
public postsecondary institutions to the
 
04:53:34.590 --> 04:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
definition of public public employer
 
04:53:37.670 --> 04:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
that was passed back in hb2 for the
 
04:53:40.030 --> 04:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of prohibiting discrimination in
 
04:53:40.040 --> 04:53:41.910 align:start position:0%
purpose of prohibiting discrimination in
higher

04:53:41.910 --> 04:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
education be it being a public employee
 
04:53:47.470 --> 04:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
in grades K through 12 or an instructor
 
04:53:49.948 --> 04:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
at the postsecondary levels the law
 
04:53:53.390 --> 04:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
applies to all one should not convey to
 
04:53:55.390 --> 04:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
any individual that his or her color
 
04:53:58.030 --> 04:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
creed or other defining characteristics
 
04:54:00.590 --> 04:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
is inherently racist sexist or
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
oppressive whether consciously or
 
04:54:02.638 --> 04:54:04.230 align:start position:0%
oppressive whether consciously or
unconsciously

04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
unconsciously
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
any instructor aligning and
 
04:54:09.788 --> 04:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
communicating one's own vision of race
 
04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
relations with the national narrative
 
04:54:14.548 --> 04:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
that uses diversity and inclusion as its
 
04:54:16.548 --> 04:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
platform is
 
04:54:18.750 --> 04:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
unacceptable it is the teachers or the
 
04:54:20.830 --> 04:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
professor's responsibility to carefully
 
04:54:23.948 --> 04:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
weigh words and actions and thoughtfully
 
04:54:27.310 --> 04:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
engage in civil discussion Public
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
Employee should reflect that reflect the
 
04:54:32.910 --> 04:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
approved curriculum of the institution
 
04:54:35.708 --> 04:54:35.718 align:start position:0%
and not personal belief the false
 
04:54:37.868 --> 04:54:37.878 align:start position:0%
National narrative that Pro professes
 
04:54:40.350 --> 04:54:40.360 align:start position:0%
that all states suffer from centuries of
 
04:54:43.070 --> 04:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
white privilege white supremacy and
 
04:54:46.390 --> 04:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
systematic racis racism does not reflect
 
04:54:49.310 --> 04:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire any instruction promoting
 
04:54:51.750 --> 04:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
that RAC racism is Alive and Well in New
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not reflect postsecondary
 
04:54:56.830 --> 04:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
education in our state nor does it
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
accurately portray our residents
 
04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
particularly those who have been here
 
04:55:03.230 --> 04:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
for Generations nor does it address the
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
fact fact that we have invest invested
 
04:55:08.430 --> 04:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
efforts to attract more individuals and
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
families to New Hampshire increasing
 
04:55:12.310 --> 04:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
diversity by nearly
 
04:55:15.708 --> 04:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
75% in the decade in closing we should
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
not forget Dr Martin Luther King's
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
famous speech and advice to the
 
04:55:23.430 --> 04:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
nation I have a dream that my four
 
04:55:25.628 --> 04:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
little children will one day live in a
 
04:55:28.750 --> 04:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
nation where they will not be judged by
 
04:55:31.230 --> 04:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
the color of their skin but by the
 
04:55:34.470 --> 04:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
content of their character as a parent
 
04:55:37.030 --> 04:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
and grandparent I ask that schools and
 
04:55:39.070 --> 04:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
postsecondary institutions teach our
 
04:55:42.310 --> 04:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
young people to think but not tell them
 
04:55:45.868 --> 04:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
what to think advocating CRT is
 
04:55:48.390 --> 04:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and does not reflect neap
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
way of life and certainly doesn't align
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
Dr King's Vision it does the opposite by
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
pitting people against each other thank
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
04:56:00.270 --> 04:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions from
 
04:56:06.270 --> 04:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.280 --> 04:56:10.670 align:start position:0%
 
Porter

04:56:10.670 --> 04:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:13.510 --> 04:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
thankes question can you tell me do you
 
04:56:13.520 --> 04:56:17.548 align:start position:0%
thankes question can you tell me do you
believe

04:56:17.548 --> 04:56:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
ASAS I think we have a law in place that
 
04:56:23.708 --> 04:56:23.718 align:start position:0%
we passed with hp2 and now I'm asking
 
04:56:27.628 --> 04:56:27.638 align:start position:0%
that that same law be put in place for
 
04:56:30.030 --> 04:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
the other end of education postsecondary
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
education but my question is do you
 
04:56:34.868 --> 04:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
believe in such implicit
 
04:56:39.150 --> 04:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
bias because implicit bias is is not
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
allowed under the my understanding we
 
04:56:45.190 --> 04:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
have to deny that that exists I want to
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
know if you believe it exists I don't
 
04:56:51.788 --> 04:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
deny that we have a history that has
 
04:56:54.150 --> 04:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
good bad ugly points throughout it I
 
04:56:57.510 --> 04:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
agree 100% as a teacher myself I was
 
04:57:00.628 --> 04:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
teaching when I was in Alaska that ens
 
04:57:03.868 --> 04:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
slavery as done by the Russian when they
 
04:57:07.230 --> 04:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
came over to Alaska was absolutely not
 
04:57:08.990 --> 04:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable and a a portion of our
 
04:57:11.230 --> 04:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
history which should be you know
 
04:57:14.110 --> 04:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
corrected and it was I also taught the
 
04:57:16.548 --> 04:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and reading a book right now
 
04:57:19.230 --> 04:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with the tattooist of owitz
 
04:57:20.548 --> 04:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
which is a wonderful book that all
 
04:57:23.470 --> 04:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
should read we have a history in this
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
country that is developing and but I
 
04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
don't believe I should be tagged or you
 
04:57:30.910 --> 04:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
should be tagged or anybody in this room
 
04:57:33.750 --> 04:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
be tagged with the idea that you are
 
04:57:36.110 --> 04:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
racist because of our past our past is
 
04:57:36.120 --> 04:57:37.190 align:start position:0%
racist because of our past our past is
our

04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
past I have we can learn from it yes the
 
04:57:43.510 --> 04:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
definition that I'm reading here from
 
04:57:43.520 --> 04:57:45.190 align:start position:0%
definition that I'm reading here from
perception.

04:57:45.190 --> 04:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
perception.
 
04:57:47.750 --> 04:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
org what does it mean to have an
 
04:57:47.760 --> 04:57:48.948 align:start position:0%
org what does it mean to have an
implicit

04:57:48.948 --> 04:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
implicit
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
bias we have a bias when rather than
 
04:57:54.910 --> 04:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
being neutral we have a preference for
 
04:57:57.868 --> 04:57:57.878 align:start position:0%
or aversion to a person or group of
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
people thus we use implicit bias to
 
04:58:04.788 --> 04:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
describe when we have udes toward people
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
or Associates stereotypes with them
 
04:58:10.670 --> 04:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
without our conscious
 
04:58:12.990 --> 04:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge do you believe that that I
 
04:58:13.000 --> 04:58:14.270 align:start position:0%
knowledge do you believe that that I
think

04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
that as you grow and one acquires the
 
04:58:21.190 --> 04:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
wisdom through life as I did when I
 
04:58:24.670 --> 04:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
moved to Alaska to a small community
 
04:58:27.270 --> 04:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
where I was in the minority my younger
 
04:58:29.670 --> 04:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
daughter grew up learning how to speak
 
04:58:32.510 --> 04:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
upic I didn't see one person different
 
04:58:34.510 --> 04:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
from another person person yes there are
 
04:58:35.990 --> 04:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
people you like and you don't like
 
04:58:38.910 --> 04:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
that's in every society however I didn't
 
04:58:40.590 --> 04:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
see it in the way in the format in the
 
04:58:42.670 --> 04:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
direction you're
 
04:58:44.830 --> 04:58:44.840 align:start position:0%

school to illustrate what discrimination
 
04:59:21.230 --> 04:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
is by for

as opposed to the blue-eyed children and
 
04:59:37.590 --> 04:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
then the next day reverse it and lot of
 
04:59:39.470 --> 04:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
the blue-eyed children as opposed to the
 
04:59:39.480 --> 04:59:40.788 align:start position:0%
the blue-eyed children as opposed to the
browney

04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
browney
 
04:59:44.070 --> 04:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
children I've seen that occur in schools
 
04:59:46.788 --> 04:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
and with younger children and that has a
 
04:59:50.670 --> 04:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
reverse effect as well and that will
 
04:59:53.350 --> 04:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes pit children against children
 
04:59:55.910 --> 04:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
who don't really
 
04:59:59.190 --> 04:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
understand and I I I think that that's
 
05:00:01.030 --> 05:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
something I wouldn't do I wouldn't line
 
05:00:03.390 --> 05:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of kids up and say okay John and
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
and Susan you pick the kids in your team
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the person standing there last is
 
05:00:09.510 --> 05:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
the one that's always Hur that's not
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
correct I also believe that when we say
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
that we're going to separate based upon
 
05:00:15.990 --> 05:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
a physical
 
05:00:18.670 --> 05:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
characteristic and who knows that young
 
05:00:20.430 --> 05:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
child may go home saying I don't have
 
05:00:23.150 --> 05:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
blue eyes and I'm not the same as that
 
05:00:24.868 --> 05:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
person has brown
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
eyes I don't think young kids see that
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
difference I don't think young kids know
 
05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
that when they come to school we teach
 
05:00:35.110 --> 05:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
them these these discriminatory actions
 
05:00:37.350 --> 05:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
by some of our actions we should be
 
05:00:39.310 --> 05:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
teaching our schools what's happened in
 
05:00:44.430 --> 05:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
our past which is negative I agree but I
 
05:00:45.830 --> 05:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be doing an
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
activity such as that and giving them
 
05:00:49.430 --> 05:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
that experience so they take home the
 
05:00:52.030 --> 05:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
wrong message and they start believing
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
the wrong
 
05:00:55.110 --> 05:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
message I think there's other ways to
 
05:00:56.430 --> 05:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
teach what you're trying to teach and
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:04.110 --> 05:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
activity uh representative Mullen
 
05:01:06.030 --> 05:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli and
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative vad for taking
 
05:01:11.110 --> 05:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
the question um so postsecondary
 
05:01:14.590 --> 05:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
students are college students is am I
 
05:01:17.150 --> 05:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
correct in assuming that that's what the
 
05:01:19.548 --> 05:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
term means in this bill representative
 
05:01:21.910 --> 05:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
fled yes that means that there the
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
pupils are K through 12 and those
 
05:01:29.750 --> 05:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
students yeah graduated from high school
 
05:01:32.310 --> 05:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay so they're they're beyond K through
 
05:01:35.548 --> 05:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
12 yes um so in this in this bill it
 
05:01:38.708 --> 05:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
says that no pupil in elementary or
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
second and no postsecondary educational
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
student shall be taught
 
05:01:45.480 --> 05:01:47.350 align:start position:0%
student shall be taught
instructed

05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
instructed
 
05:01:50.430 --> 05:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
inculcated or compelled to express a
 
05:01:53.948 --> 05:01:53.958 align:start position:0%
belief in or support for any one of the
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
following and then I don't have the list
 
05:01:58.430 --> 05:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
in front of me but I mean we basically
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
know that it's the sort of divisive
 
05:02:02.400 --> 05:02:03.310 align:start position:0%
know that it's the sort of divisive
concept

05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
concept
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
language that follows at this at this
 
05:02:08.628 --> 05:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
point correct everything that's in the
 
05:02:11.670 --> 05:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
highlighted dark area is new everything
 
05:02:16.510 --> 05:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
that is in the uh nonbold font is what
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
is in law right now okay so could I have
 
05:02:22.350 --> 05:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
a followup representative cordelli thank
 
05:02:22.360 --> 05:02:23.948 align:start position:0%
a followup representative cordelli thank
you

05:02:23.948 --> 05:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:02:27.750 --> 05:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
so by adding this to the statute by
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
adding postsecondary to the
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
statute are we saying then that
 
05:02:40.830 --> 05:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
colleges in college classes people can't
 
05:02:43.868 --> 05:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
discuss critical race Theory no we're
 
05:02:45.270 --> 05:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
not saying
 
05:02:48.510 --> 05:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
that we're not we're not saying we're
 
05:02:50.628 --> 05:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
not saying that you can't be
 
05:02:54.868 --> 05:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
teaching uh um issues that are in our
 
05:02:58.030 --> 05:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
past that have dealt with race you can
 
05:03:00.030 --> 05:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
te but you're not going to Advocate it
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
as your personal
 
05:03:01.680 --> 05:03:05.230 align:start position:0%
as your personal
belief

05:03:05.230 --> 05:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:07.110 --> 05:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
one one more follow up and I promise
 
05:03:09.510 --> 05:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'll get i'll get off of this got the
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
promise I I I I wouldn't have given it
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I'm having a hard time with
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the nebulousness of the word
 
05:03:26.270 --> 05:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
instructed or taught at the
 
05:03:29.548 --> 05:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
postsecondary level because it would
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
seem to me that we would not we would
 
05:03:33.708 --> 05:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
want adults to to be able to talk about
 
05:03:36.670 --> 05:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
anything in an instructional situation
 
05:03:39.670 --> 05:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
we would want them to use critical
 
05:03:42.270 --> 05:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
thinking to draw their own conclusions
 
05:03:46.110 --> 05:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
at the post-secondary level uh a and so
 
05:03:46.120 --> 05:03:47.390 align:start position:0%
at the post-secondary level uh a and so
I'm

05:03:47.390 --> 05:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:03:52.750 --> 05:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
wondering how this cannot be a violation
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
of someone's freedom of speech we have
 
05:03:57.708 --> 05:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
to look at the rest of that law that was
 
05:03:59.670 --> 05:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
passed last year which you don't see
 
05:04:03.430 --> 05:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
here and when it talks about
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
any one or more of the following and
 
05:04:07.910 --> 05:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
then you go down and you'll see the
 
05:04:10.230 --> 05:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
areas which this bill talks to which I
 
05:04:12.190 --> 05:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
spoke to at the beginning of my
 
05:04:14.708 --> 05:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
presentation those are the issues which
 
05:04:17.310 --> 05:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
were were directing this bill this
 
05:04:19.548 --> 05:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education instruction
 
05:04:22.948 --> 05:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
towards but my question to you and it's
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
the same question representative
 
05:04:27.788 --> 05:04:27.798 align:start position:0%
cordelli it's not a new one my question
 
05:04:30.150 --> 05:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
to you is
 
05:04:34.628 --> 05:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
um why would we want to prohibit adults
 
05:04:37.390 --> 05:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
from talking about anything in their
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education that they have
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
paid for and
 
05:04:45.868 --> 05:04:45.878 align:start position:0%
are capable of formulating their own
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
opinions I mean we're talking college
 
05:04:51.990 --> 05:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
students why would we want to do that
 
05:04:55.510 --> 05:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
would that not be considered curtailing
 
05:04:58.910 --> 05:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:01.990 --> 05:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
speech I would just love to be have the
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to attend and join some of
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
these classrooms where I have been told
 
05:05:10.750 --> 05:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
by college students you Echo back
 
05:05:12.788 --> 05:05:12.798 align:start position:0%
exactly what you want to that what that
 
05:05:15.670 --> 05:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
Professor wants and you'll get your Aid
 
05:05:18.190 --> 05:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
you show a Divergent way of
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
thinking and hang it up I think that we
 
05:05:24.670 --> 05:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
got to be very careful that we don't
 
05:05:27.830 --> 05:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
narrow down the where we're going with
 
05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
our instruction in a postsecondary level
 
05:05:33.750 --> 05:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
by coming across and saying I as the
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
instructor and advocating this and
 
05:05:36.000 --> 05:05:37.190 align:start position:0%
instructor and advocating this and
pushing

05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
pushing
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
this I as a young student would be kind
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
of like wow I guess I know how I can get
 
05:05:45.390 --> 05:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
out of this class I'll just Echo what
 
05:05:47.470 --> 05:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
that individual's saying if I go the
 
05:05:50.548 --> 05:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
other way I know where I'm going to be
 
05:05:52.910 --> 05:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh so I think that there are certain
 
05:05:55.548 --> 05:05:55.558 align:start position:0%
ways of communicating we don't want to
 
05:05:58.390 --> 05:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
teach them what to think we want to
 
05:06:00.750 --> 05:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
teach them how to think and we ought to
 
05:06:02.750 --> 05:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
be able to respect persp persectives
 
05:06:05.708 --> 05:06:05.718 align:start position:0%
from different different uh
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
directions I'm not sure that you
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
answered my question representative but
 
05:06:12.070 --> 05:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the attempt you're welcome
 
05:06:12.080 --> 05:06:13.708 align:start position:0%
thank you for the attempt you're welcome
representative

05:06:13.708 --> 05:06:13.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:06:17.510 --> 05:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
anner thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:06:19.350 --> 05:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative lad for taking the
 
05:06:22.548 --> 05:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
question um I think there has been
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
nothing since I've been a legislator
 
05:06:29.430 --> 05:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
that has caused more of my constituents
 
05:06:32.830 --> 05:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
and particularly teacher friends of mine
 
05:06:36.788 --> 05:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
uh to contact me and talk to me uh and
 
05:06:41.110 --> 05:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
we've wrestled with this about this bill
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
and you're making it even I in my
 
05:06:48.430 --> 05:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
opinion um even harder on teachers uh
 
05:06:51.628 --> 05:06:51.638 align:start position:0%
and now even College professors um and
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering because you were an
 
05:06:56.070 --> 05:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
administrator and because you were a
 
05:06:59.350 --> 05:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
teacher given what we have
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
here um How do you feel a person in a
 
05:07:09.190 --> 05:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
classroom uh would be when some student

in the class asks a question that enters
 
05:07:17.948 --> 05:07:17.958 align:start position:0%
into this critical race Theory diversive
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
concept nebulous Cloud that we're
 
05:07:24.670 --> 05:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
talking about how how would you counsel
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
a teacher as to how to handle that you
 
05:07:30.270 --> 05:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
can respond to a question you don't have
 
05:07:32.430 --> 05:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
to say this is my way of thinking you
 
05:07:34.150 --> 05:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
can respond to a question you can have
 
05:07:34.160 --> 05:07:35.070 align:start position:0%
can respond to a question you can have

open
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
dialogue I I don't object to that and I
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that that a college
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
professor should however when you come
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
out and you're advocating for that or
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
forming committees or groups to work on
 
05:07:50.350 --> 05:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
subjects like this on this topic you're
 
05:07:53.110 --> 05:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
advocating for it you're pushing it and
 
05:07:54.910 --> 05:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
that's something we don't want to push
 
05:07:56.948 --> 05:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
discrimination because that's exactly
 
05:07:59.270 --> 05:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
what it is it's ending up pitting
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
individuals against other individuals
 
05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
when we we uh didn't need to go that
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
direction I believe our society is
 
05:08:07.470 --> 05:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
changing and it's changing for the
 
05:08:09.628 --> 05:08:09.638 align:start position:0%
better we're all more aware and it's
 
05:08:14.230 --> 05:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
moving forward this legislation or CRT
 
05:08:16.030 --> 05:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
or any of these projects that have come
 
05:08:19.590 --> 05:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
out are just I think tearing the fabric
 
05:08:21.788 --> 05:08:21.798 align:start position:0%
of this country apart and I think there
 
05:08:23.470 --> 05:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
is are different opinions on the
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
committee right now on this topic and
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
you're you you're welcome to have your
 
05:08:28.120 --> 05:08:29.110 align:start position:0%
you're you you're welcome to have your
own

05:08:29.110 --> 05:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
own
 
05:08:31.548 --> 05:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
opinion well thank thank I respect thank
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
you for that um I'm glad I have still
 
05:08:37.830 --> 05:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
free speech yes you do we all
 
05:08:41.190 --> 05:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
do any other uh questions for the
 
05:08:43.910 --> 05:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative um maybe if I could ask
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative um it's my recollection
 
05:08:49.548 --> 05:08:49.558 align:start position:0%
that the existing statute uh currently
 
05:08:53.070 --> 05:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
has a provision uh expli explicitly
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
stating that um uh subjects um as we've
 
05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
been discussing um can be part of any
 
05:09:01.680 --> 05:09:02.830 align:start position:0%
been discussing um can be part of any
academic

05:09:02.830 --> 05:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
academic
 
05:09:06.230 --> 05:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
instruction that would I think uh or
 
05:09:09.628 --> 05:09:09.638 align:start position:0%
should satisfy Any teacher concerns am
 
05:09:11.230 --> 05:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
am I correct in my recollection of that
 
05:09:13.590 --> 05:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
statute that is in law and you are
 
05:09:17.070 --> 05:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you very much for your
 
05:09:22.708 --> 05:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm sorry repes representative
 
05:09:24.670 --> 05:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
Ford thank
 
05:09:27.990 --> 05:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
you representative one question has
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
puzzled me throughout this entire
 
05:09:35.070 --> 05:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
discussion is never seems to be a
 
05:09:37.230 --> 05:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
definition of a
 
05:09:40.830 --> 05:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
theory and that what is often advanced
 
05:09:44.390 --> 05:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of a theory is Advanced as
 
05:09:47.430 --> 05:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
fact and the theory is as I've always
 
05:09:50.548 --> 05:09:50.558 align:start position:0%
been taught something that is not yet
 
05:09:54.070 --> 05:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
proven and so I wonder about part of the
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
issue here isn't that people who are
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps not as skillful in their
 
05:10:01.590 --> 05:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
teaching but are teaching the theory as
 
05:10:01.600 --> 05:10:02.628 align:start position:0%
teaching but are teaching the theory as
though

05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
though
 
05:10:08.430 --> 05:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
speculation the thing falls on its face
 
05:10:14.910 --> 05:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of just rational
 
05:10:20.310 --> 05:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.590 --> 05:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
stated thank you very
 
05:10:25.070 --> 05:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
much seeing no further questions thank
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.040 --> 05:10:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:10:32.990 --> 05:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:10:36.670 --> 05:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
next uh person to
 
05:10:59.070 --> 05:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
ACLU thank you chairman and other
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
honorable memb members of this committee
 
05:11:05.310 --> 05:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Devon chaffy
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm the executive director of the
 
05:11:09.990 --> 05:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
ACLU of New Hampshire which is a
 
05:11:12.190 --> 05:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofit nonpartisan organization that
 
05:11:13.948 --> 05:11:13.958 align:start position:0%
has been defending civil rights and
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
civil liberties in the state of New
 
05:11:18.510 --> 05:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for over 50 years and I come
 
05:11:20.830 --> 05:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
today uh before you today to testify an
 
05:11:24.070 --> 05:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB uh 13113 as an
 
05:11:26.990 --> 05:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional restriction on academic
 
05:11:30.788 --> 05:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
freedom I'd like to start uh by quoting
 
05:11:32.708 --> 05:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
an additional quote from Martin Luther
 
05:11:37.230 --> 05:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
King Jr who wrote in 1967 that and I
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
quote whites it must frankly be said are
 
05:11:41.868 --> 05:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
not putting in a mass effort to
 
05:11:43.470 --> 05:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
re-educate themselves out of their
 
05:11:43.480 --> 05:11:44.350 align:start position:0%
re-educate themselves out of their
racial

05:11:44.350 --> 05:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
racial
 
05:11:47.390 --> 05:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
ignorance Martin Luther King Jr went on
 
05:11:50.430 --> 05:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
to say in 197 in
 
05:11:53.390 --> 05:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
1967 that it is an aspect of their sense
 
05:11:55.548 --> 05:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
of superiority that the white people of
 
05:11:57.310 --> 05:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
America believe that they have so little
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
to to learn similarly he said in an
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
interview that the concept of Supremacy
 
05:12:04.830 --> 05:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
is so embedded in white society that it
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
will take many years for color to cease
 
05:12:10.190 --> 05:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
to be a judgmental factor I wanted to
 
05:12:11.830 --> 05:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
include that additional poll because I
 
05:12:13.868 --> 05:12:13.878 align:start position:0%
think it's very important to fully
 
05:12:16.190 --> 05:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
understand um the teachings of Martin
 
05:12:18.030 --> 05:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
Luther King what he was trying to
 
05:12:20.548 --> 05:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
express and his indication that we were
 
05:12:22.670 --> 05:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
going to be struggling with issues
 
05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
related to race for decades to come and
 
05:12:26.830 --> 05:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
that we had much learning and much
 
05:12:28.390 --> 05:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
growth to
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
do I want to start by noting that the
 
05:12:32.750 --> 05:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
band concept act that was was enacted in
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 last year specifically excluded
 
05:12:37.830 --> 05:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
public state colleges and universities
 
05:12:40.110 --> 05:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
from its scope um as was mentioned it
 
05:12:41.868 --> 05:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
included an academic freedom exception
 
05:12:43.548 --> 05:12:43.558 align:start position:0%
for faculty members and the New
 
05:12:45.548 --> 05:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Community College systems
 
05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
in the academic setting and it appears
 
05:12:51.070 --> 05:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
that HB 1313 is aiming to expand
 
05:12:53.230 --> 05:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
specific provisions of the ban Concepts
 
05:12:55.510 --> 05:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
act to apply to public state colleges
 
05:12:55.520 --> 05:12:56.510 align:start position:0%
act to apply to public state colleges
and

05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:59.590 --> 05:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
universities and indeed HB 13113 even
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
seems to subject Colley faculty to
 
05:13:04.190 --> 05:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuits if they are perceived to
 
05:13:08.310 --> 05:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
violate the ACT this in fact this
 
05:13:11.788 --> 05:13:11.798 align:start position:0%
expansion which HB 1313 is attempting to
 
05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish is simply said clearly a
 
05:13:17.788 --> 05:13:17.798 align:start position:0%
violation of the US Constitution and the
 
05:13:20.190 --> 05:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
First Amendment it is in fact a
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
violation of long-standing Supreme Court
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
precedent going back over 60 years
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
projecting academic freedom especially
 
05:13:30.270 --> 05:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
in the University setting the you the US
 
05:13:32.430 --> 05:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court stated in we versus the
 
05:13:34.150 --> 05:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that teachers and
 
05:13:36.030 --> 05:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
students must always remain free to
 
05:13:39.270 --> 05:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
inquire to study and to evaluate to gain
 
05:13:41.788 --> 05:13:41.798 align:start position:0%
new maturity and understanding otherwise
 
05:13:45.390 --> 05:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
our civilization will stagnate and die
 
05:13:47.910 --> 05:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
again in 1978 the US Supreme Court made
 
05:13:49.788 --> 05:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
clear that academic freedom though not
 
05:13:51.590 --> 05:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
specifically not a specifically
 
05:13:54.030 --> 05:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
enumerated constitutional right has long
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
been viewed as a special concern for the
 
05:13:58.470 --> 05:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
First Amendment and more recently the
 
05:14:01.030 --> 05:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has made clear that
 
05:14:03.430 --> 05:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
particularly in the University setting
 
05:14:06.510 --> 05:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what HB 13113 is trying to
 
05:14:08.830 --> 05:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
Target it is unquestionable that
 
05:14:11.830 --> 05:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint based suppression of speech is
 
05:14:14.190 --> 05:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
impermissible silencing a particular
 
05:14:16.030 --> 05:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint here we're talking about
 
05:14:19.430 --> 05:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
concepts related to racism and sexism
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
violates the first amendment
 
05:14:25.868 --> 05:14:25.878 align:start position:0%
period moreover as it stands the ban
 
05:14:28.390 --> 05:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
concept Act is so unclear and vague that
 
05:14:29.910 --> 05:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
it fails to provide the necessary
 
05:14:31.910 --> 05:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
guidance to Educators about what they
 
05:14:34.590 --> 05:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
can and cannot include in their
 
05:14:38.030 --> 05:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
courses HB 1313 would only compound this
 
05:14:39.868 --> 05:14:39.878 align:start position:0%
defect by applying the ACT to public
 
05:14:42.190 --> 05:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities again where
 
05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
academic freedom is particularly
 
05:14:47.110 --> 05:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
protected under the first amendment I
 
05:14:48.868 --> 05:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
want to provide a little historical
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
context here the New Hampshire band
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
Concepts act includes four of the 10
 
05:14:55.990 --> 05:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
band Concepts that were included in
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
president Trump's September 22nd 2020
 
05:15:01.868 --> 05:15:01.878 align:start position:0%
executive order and a federal court
 
05:15:04.350 --> 05:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
partially enjoined that
 
05:15:07.230 --> 05:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
order finding the order to be and I
 
05:15:09.590 --> 05:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
quote so vague that it was impossible
 
05:15:11.548 --> 05:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
for plaintiffs to determine what conduct
 
05:15:11.558 --> 05:15:12.590 align:start position:0%
for plaintiffs to determine what conduct
is

05:15:12.590 --> 05:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited so the court enjoined that
 
05:15:19.788 --> 05:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
order which included four of the ban the
 
05:15:21.470 --> 05:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
four ban Concepts that are included in
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law because it was so
 
05:15:25.510 --> 05:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
vague that there was no way for
 
05:15:27.868 --> 05:15:27.878 align:start position:0%
potential plaintiffs to to understand
 
05:15:30.110 --> 05:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
what the law was
 
05:15:32.190 --> 05:15:32.200 align:start position:0%
prohibiting because of this vague
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
language and the stiff penalties and the
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
ban Concepts act some educators are
 
05:15:38.670 --> 05:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
already right now avoiding important
 
05:15:40.708 --> 05:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
topics concerning race and gender
 
05:15:42.510 --> 05:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
because they fear being the subject of a
 
05:15:44.670 --> 05:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
complaint or lawsuit from an angry
 
05:15:47.310 --> 05:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
parent or student who doesn't like their
 
05:15:51.070 --> 05:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:54.030 --> 05:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
example is Tiffany juwels book this book
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
is anti-racist banned under the
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
ACT is it it's it's a New York Times
 
05:16:02.948 --> 05:16:02.958 align:start position:0%
bestseller it's very widely read it's
 
05:16:03.948 --> 05:16:03.958 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
acclaimed is this something to uh to
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
speak to what a representative said
 
05:16:10.708 --> 05:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
earlier that we don't want adults even
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:19.868 --> 05:16:19.878 align:start position:0%
setting what about stamped for kids
 
05:16:22.830 --> 05:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
racism anti-racism and you is that
 
05:16:24.990 --> 05:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
banned under the
 
05:16:27.708 --> 05:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
ACT these are well acclaimed widely read
 
05:16:30.670 --> 05:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
contemporary works but no one right now
 
05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
knows if they're per permissible under
 
05:16:35.430 --> 05:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
the ban Concepts act no one knows and
 
05:16:37.150 --> 05:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
the state will not provide concrete
 
05:16:38.830 --> 05:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
answers as to whether these specific
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
texts are covered or not and as a result
 
05:16:43.830 --> 05:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
in order to avoid the acts penalties
 
05:16:46.470 --> 05:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
which are pretty severe teachers are
 
05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
currently right now pulling books like
 
05:16:51.230 --> 05:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
this from staff and course instruction
 
05:16:53.470 --> 05:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
out of fear of liability even if these
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
books may not necessarily be covered by
 
05:16:58.270 --> 05:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
the act that is the definition of the
 
05:17:00.868 --> 05:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
chill created by an unconstitutionally
 
05:17:00.878 --> 05:17:02.190 align:start position:0%
chill created by an unconstitutionally
vague

05:17:02.190 --> 05:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
vague
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
and it demonstrates the damage that such
 
05:17:06.270 --> 05:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
chill can do in the
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
classroom it's important to understand
 
05:17:11.310 --> 05:17:11.320 align:start position:0%
that under HB 1313 its applic and its
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
application of the ban Concepts penalty
 
05:17:15.628 --> 05:17:15.638 align:start position:0%
to college professors that any college
 
05:17:17.750 --> 05:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
student assigned a book perceiv received
 
05:17:19.788 --> 05:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
as being prohibited by the ban Concepts
 
05:17:22.590 --> 05:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
act anyone who assigns a book that that
 
05:17:25.310 --> 05:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
they perceived is banned by the ACT
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
could file a superior court lawsuit
 
05:17:28.830 --> 05:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
against the professor's school and
 
05:17:31.430 --> 05:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
potentially the professor themselves
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's no wonder that educators are acting
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
out of caution and fear and because of
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
that students are missing out on
 
05:17:39.670 --> 05:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
critically important discussions on race
 
05:17:42.830 --> 05:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
and gender education focusing on Race
 
05:17:45.510 --> 05:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
gender and diversity Equity inclusion
 
05:17:47.670 --> 05:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
Concepts in classrooms provides a
 
05:17:49.628 --> 05:17:49.638 align:start position:0%
multitude of benefits for students and
 
05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
Society at large these discussions of
 
05:17:53.750 --> 05:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
race and gender are particularly
 
05:17:55.510 --> 05:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
important as New Hampshire becomes
 
05:17:58.628 --> 05:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
rapidly more diverse as was Illustrated
 
05:18:02.430 --> 05:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
in the recent release census in 2020
 
05:18:05.150 --> 05:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
2020 instruction on race and gender
 
05:18:07.590 --> 05:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
serves to close existing opportunity
 
05:18:09.470 --> 05:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
gaps and inequalities faced by students
 
05:18:11.110 --> 05:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
of color in New Hampshire and other
 
05:18:13.548 --> 05:18:13.558 align:start position:0%
historically marginalized groups it also
 
05:18:15.110 --> 05:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
helps these students to feel a better
 
05:18:17.470 --> 05:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
sense of belonging in New Hampshire and
 
05:18:19.910 --> 05:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
finally HB
 
05:18:22.548 --> 05:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
13313 and its expansion of the ban
 
05:18:27.230 --> 05:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
Concepts Act is put simply about
 
05:18:30.030 --> 05:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
censorship censorship is a dangerous
 
05:18:32.470 --> 05:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
Concept in universities we should be
 
05:18:34.510 --> 05:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
allowing ideas to be discussed even
 
05:18:36.270 --> 05:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
those we don't agree with so that
 
05:18:38.548 --> 05:18:38.558 align:start position:0%
students are exposed to an alternative
 
05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
perspective and taught to evaluate
 
05:18:43.190 --> 05:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
issues for themselves this skill set is
 
05:18:45.070 --> 05:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to educate the next generation
 
05:18:46.750 --> 05:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
of adults who have critical thinking
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
skills and conveniently participate in
 
05:18:49.440 --> 05:18:50.390 align:start position:0%
skills and conveniently participate in
our

05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:18:52.670 --> 05:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
democracy New Hampshire should not Rob
 
05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
students of the information ideas and
 
05:18:56.670 --> 05:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
instructional approaches that prepare
 
05:18:58.990 --> 05:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
them to engage in the just the type of
 
05:19:01.708 --> 05:19:01.718 align:start position:0%
robust dialogue and analytical thinking
 
05:19:03.670 --> 05:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
that is necessary to effectively
 
05:19:05.708 --> 05:19:05.718 align:start position:0%
function as a citizen in America's
 
05:19:08.670 --> 05:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
democratic system for these reasons I
 
05:19:10.270 --> 05:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge the committee to
 
05:19:13.310 --> 05:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
recommend that HB 1313 be inexpedient to
 
05:19:15.390 --> 05:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'm happy to take any
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you any
 
05:19:22.190 --> 05:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
05:19:26.830 --> 05:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
Moffet thank you Mr uh chair and thank
 
05:19:29.190 --> 05:19:29.200 align:start position:0%

05:19:31.470 --> 05:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
impassion testimony let me preface my
 
05:19:34.110 --> 05:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
question by quickly pointing out that I
 
05:19:38.270 --> 05:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
have a had a career in Academia as a
 
05:19:40.470 --> 05:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
professor in the community college
 
05:19:42.788 --> 05:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
system University system and elsewhere
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
to preface my question and uh I am very
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
much a First Amendment person and I'm
 
05:19:54.310 --> 05:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
very much for freedom of speech in the
 
05:19:56.708 --> 05:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
college classroom and I'm not sure where
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
I am on this bill at this time I want to
 
05:20:01.788 --> 05:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
hear a lot more from everyone but my
 
05:20:05.670 --> 05:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
question for you is with regard to the
 
05:20:09.750 --> 05:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
to the fact that there are academic
 
05:20:13.070 --> 05:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
people out there in New Hampshire and
 
05:20:16.270 --> 05:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
everywhere who advocate in
 
05:20:20.590 --> 05:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
classes they Advocate Advocate online in
 
05:20:22.948 --> 05:20:22.958 align:start position:0%
journals and social media they advocate
 
05:20:22.958 --> 05:20:24.750 align:start position:0%
journals and social media they advocate
for

05:20:24.750 --> 05:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:20:27.948 --> 05:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
ideologies for movements and for
 
05:20:32.350 --> 05:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
people who favor the violent overthrow
 
05:20:34.830 --> 05:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
of of our government they they to change
 
05:20:37.190 --> 05:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
our government by any means
 
05:20:39.150 --> 05:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
necessary so is
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:47.868 --> 05:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.190 --> 05:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
luno so my question for you is is this
 
05:20:55.430 --> 05:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh treasonous seditious uh behavior in
 
05:20:58.548 --> 05:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
classrooms okay with with
 
05:21:01.390 --> 05:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
you well I I I I thank you for your
 
05:21:02.990 --> 05:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
question representative maet and thank
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
you for first of all for your your your
 
05:21:07.708 --> 05:21:07.718 align:start position:0%
interest and dedication to the first
 
05:21:09.310 --> 05:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
amendment I would love to continue this
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
conversation beyond the hearing um
 
05:21:13.270 --> 05:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
especially given the particular concerns
 
05:21:15.390 --> 05:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
that we have over the application of
 
05:21:18.788 --> 05:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
this statute to the university setting
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
uh certainly uh you know I for one
 
05:21:22.670 --> 05:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
believe that universities should
 
05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
thoroughly vet their professors to make
 
05:21:25.868 --> 05:21:25.878 align:start position:0%
sure that their professors are well
 
05:21:27.628 --> 05:21:27.638 align:start position:0%
qualified and in line with with
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
University values uh I do not believe
 
05:21:32.670 --> 05:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
that is the place of the New Hampshire
 
05:21:34.628 --> 05:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
legislature to begin
 
05:21:37.030 --> 05:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
legislating the type of conversations
 
05:21:38.350 --> 05:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
and certainly the topics of
 
05:21:40.270 --> 05:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
conversations that can or cannot be
 
05:21:42.190 --> 05:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
discussed in classrooms I think
 
05:21:43.910 --> 05:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
inevitably what we are going what you
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
will get from that and inevitably what
 
05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
you have gotten from that type of
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
restriction in an academic setting in
 
05:21:51.830 --> 05:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
other countries where there are
 
05:21:54.628 --> 05:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
authoritarian regimes is a limited
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
ability for people to exchange ideas I
 
05:21:58.788 --> 05:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
think that's a very dangerous road for
 
05:22:02.750 --> 05:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
us to begin to go down
 
05:22:06.510 --> 05:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
follow up so my my question simply was
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
you're okay with academics advocating
 
05:22:11.788 --> 05:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
for the violent overthrow of our
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
government I'm sorry sir I don't I don't
 
05:22:16.830 --> 05:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
know exactly what examples that you are
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
are are speaking to with regards to the
 
05:22:20.830 --> 05:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
violent overthrow of our government I'm
 
05:22:22.830 --> 05:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
not aware of any of those examples in
 
05:22:25.670 --> 05:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh certainly and uh that
 
05:22:28.430 --> 05:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
is not and I what I will say is that is
 
05:22:33.548 --> 05:22:33.558 align:start position:0%
that is not the type of uh of activity
 
05:22:35.868 --> 05:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
or discussion in classrooms that we are
 
05:22:38.030 --> 05:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
seeing be being shut down by the
 
05:22:40.110 --> 05:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
existing band Concepts law what we are
 
05:22:42.430 --> 05:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
seeing being affected and I'm happy to
 
05:22:44.670 --> 05:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
provide you with additional examples of
 
05:22:46.990 --> 05:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
the types of conversations that
 
05:22:48.990 --> 05:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
currently teachers are afraid to engage
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
in and the way that teachers are having
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
to change their approach to curriculum
 
05:22:55.110 --> 05:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire simply has to
 
05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
do with the way that they are talking
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
about racism and sexism uh and and the
 
05:23:02.390 --> 05:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
way that they um uh manifest themselves
 
05:23:04.390 --> 05:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
whether throughout US history or
 
05:23:07.270 --> 05:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
currently in existing Society or in
 
05:23:09.670 --> 05:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
individual students lives and student
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
experiences those are the types of
 
05:23:14.030 --> 05:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
things that we are see seeing in reality
 
05:23:15.750 --> 05:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
being shilled here in New Hampshire by
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
the existing law and that we fear would
 
05:23:20.190 --> 05:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
be chilled if this law were to expand to
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
the university system thank
 
05:23:25.910 --> 05:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
you further
 
05:23:29.470 --> 05:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
05:23:32.110 --> 05:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
Ford um and thank you for your
 
05:23:36.350 --> 05:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:40.270 --> 05:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
useful it doesn't get at however in my
 
05:23:43.750 --> 05:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
opinion a particular flaw in that whole
 
05:23:46.830 --> 05:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
argument and it's flawed
 
05:23:49.590 --> 05:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
reasoning we learned from many Greek
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
philosophers that something like just
 
05:23:56.190 --> 05:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
because this follows it doesn't mean it
 
05:23:59.868 --> 05:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
caused it the thing follows an idea so
 
05:24:02.430 --> 05:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
for someone assert that someone who
 
05:24:05.910 --> 05:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
looks like me who's white who's male
 
05:24:08.670 --> 05:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
must therefore be implicitly racist all
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
Louisiana those become facts used to
 
05:24:18.190 --> 05:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
butress their
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
racist and yet there's no
 
05:24:27.990 --> 05:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
proof and they valid validate or is
 
05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
invalidated by the flawed reasoning po
 
05:24:33.628 --> 05:24:33.638 align:start position:0%
Hawk Ergo proor
 
05:24:37.230 --> 05:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hawk we're taught that in school in the
 
05:24:37.240 --> 05:24:38.670 align:start position:0%
Hawk we're taught that in school in the
freshman

05:24:38.670 --> 05:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
freshman
 
05:24:41.510 --> 05:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
year that just because a thing follows
 
05:24:43.430 --> 05:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
another thing doesn't mean the first
 
05:24:45.230 --> 05:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
thing caused
 
05:24:49.110 --> 05:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
it and so just because I'm white or male
 
05:24:50.990 --> 05:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
or from
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
Louisiana it doesn't follow necessarily
 
05:24:56.990 --> 05:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:59.708 --> 05:24:59.718 align:start position:0%
racist I'm not denying that many people
 
05:24:59.718 --> 05:25:01.788 align:start position:0%
racist I'm not denying that many people
are

05:25:01.788 --> 05:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:25:04.230 --> 05:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
and that has a long history in there of
 
05:25:07.030 --> 05:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
that that certainly could be discussed
 
05:25:09.590 --> 05:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
but to then turn it around and lay it on
 
05:25:09.600 --> 05:25:10.750 align:start position:0%
but to then turn it around and lay it on
the

05:25:10.750 --> 05:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:25:14.110 --> 05:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
student that you are implicitly
 
05:25:17.070 --> 05:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
racist because you
 
05:25:19.628 --> 05:25:19.638 align:start position:0%
exist that is what I call flawed
 
05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
reasoning and that's what I object to in
 
05:25:28.548 --> 05:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:30.868 --> 05:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
teaching that's what I'm wondering your
 
05:25:34.510 --> 05:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
sense where does reasoning apply those
 
05:25:38.708 --> 05:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
kind of faulty elements of an argument
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
when does that get challenged because
 
05:25:44.030 --> 05:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
you can't do it in the US Army anymore
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
they've got a four-star general up there
 
05:25:48.670 --> 05:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
telling you that this is the truth I
 
05:25:50.030 --> 05:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't know about your military
 
05:25:51.910 --> 05:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
experience I was in the Marines and the
 
05:25:53.548 --> 05:25:53.558 align:start position:0%
Army and the
 
05:25:55.590 --> 05:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
Navy and none of them would have
 
05:25:57.470 --> 05:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
tolerated that sort of in what they
 
05:26:00.270 --> 05:26:00.280 align:start position:0%
would see in subordination so that is
 
05:26:03.110 --> 05:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
being taught in our nation and what
 
05:26:07.470 --> 05:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
we're objecting to are some aspects of
 
05:26:09.868 --> 05:26:09.878 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative board for
 
05:26:13.270 --> 05:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
your question um through our work uh in
 
05:26:15.590 --> 05:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
this area and specifically within the
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
past 12 months we have
 
05:26:20.190 --> 05:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
reviewed dozens and dozens of different
 
05:26:21.750 --> 05:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum throughout the state we have
 
05:26:24.750 --> 05:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
talked to you know probably close to a
 
05:26:27.628 --> 05:26:27.638 align:start position:0%
hundred different Educators we have read
 
05:26:30.070 --> 05:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
I want to say a pile of books along
 
05:26:32.030 --> 05:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
these lines that are talking about
 
05:26:34.070 --> 05:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
really important issues of race and
 
05:26:36.350 --> 05:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
racism in our country and how they are
 
05:26:39.788 --> 05:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
manifested and nothing that we have read
 
05:26:39.798 --> 05:26:40.948 align:start position:0%
manifested and nothing that we have read
or

05:26:40.948 --> 05:26:40.958 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:26:40.958 --> 05:26:42.910 align:start position:0%
or
discussed

05:26:42.910 --> 05:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
05:26:45.948 --> 05:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
um makes the assertion that you are
 
05:26:47.590 --> 05:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
describing with regards to somebody
 
05:26:50.830 --> 05:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
being inherently racist um it's they
 
05:26:53.030 --> 05:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
what they are encouraging is a critical
 
05:26:55.750 --> 05:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
look at the issues of race in our
 
05:26:58.070 --> 05:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
society they are encouraging people to
 
05:27:01.990 --> 05:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
to to consider what impact historical
 
05:27:04.350 --> 05:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
events have on what is happening in our
 
05:27:06.788 --> 05:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
society currently um and those are the
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
type again of conversations that I be
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
believe are being chilled by the
 
05:27:12.750 --> 05:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
existing law and that chill would only
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
be spread by HB 13313 and its expansion
 
05:27:21.430 --> 05:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:26.868 --> 05:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:26.878 --> 05:27:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
lakas

05:27:28.430 --> 05:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
lakas
 
05:27:32.590 --> 05:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
um the law my understanding my reading
 
05:27:33.470 --> 05:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:27:35.670 --> 05:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
law what's
 
05:27:35.680 --> 05:27:37.270 align:start position:0%
law what's
actually

05:27:37.270 --> 05:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:27:37.280 --> 05:27:40.628 align:start position:0%
actually
um

05:27:40.628 --> 05:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:44.110 --> 05:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
the conversation that just happened was
 
05:27:47.310 --> 05:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
specifically saying that you can't teach
 
05:27:49.788 --> 05:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
that one race is inherently Superior
 
05:27:52.150 --> 05:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
inferior whatever or
 
05:27:55.830 --> 05:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
sex because of those physical properties
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't see I don't understand I'm
 
05:28:01.350 --> 05:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
hoping you can explain to me how
 
05:28:03.110 --> 05:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
something that says that you can't make
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
those assertions then becomes we can't
 
05:28:08.350 --> 05:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
talk about those things especially when
 
05:28:11.628 --> 05:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
the law says these things can be
 
05:28:13.830 --> 05:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
discussed there's a big difference
 
05:28:16.670 --> 05:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
between talking about racism and people
 
05:28:19.470 --> 05:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
who are racist and places where racism
 
05:28:22.590 --> 05:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
shows up Etc and teaching that because
 
05:28:24.670 --> 05:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
you're white you're racist those are two
 
05:28:27.350 --> 05:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
completely different things so I'm not
 
05:28:31.190 --> 05:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
sure what do we have to do to make
 
05:28:31.200 --> 05:28:33.670 align:start position:0%
sure what do we have to do to make
clear

05:28:33.670 --> 05:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
that that what is against the law is
 
05:28:39.110 --> 05:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
teaching that you're white therefore
 
05:28:41.708 --> 05:28:41.718 align:start position:0%
you're racist as opposed to okay let's
 
05:28:43.990 --> 05:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
look at racism and because it does exist
 
05:28:46.830 --> 05:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
in this country but that's very
 
05:28:49.230 --> 05:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
different to say racism exists in this
 
05:28:50.708 --> 05:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
country and these are incidents and
 
05:28:52.548 --> 05:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
these are harms that are caused and all
 
05:28:54.430 --> 05:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
these great discussions is very
 
05:28:55.990 --> 05:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
different than saying you're white
 
05:28:58.670 --> 05:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
you're racist thank you representative I
 
05:29:00.510 --> 05:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
think you bring up a a really important
 
05:29:02.910 --> 05:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
issue and it's one that has been raised
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
by by other representatives in the
 
05:29:07.350 --> 05:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
course of this discussion I think the
 
05:29:09.310 --> 05:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
concern and what we're seeing with the
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
existing law is that you know it's these
 
05:29:14.350 --> 05:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
these supposed distinctions that are
 
05:29:16.470 --> 05:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
being made between you know
 
05:29:18.948 --> 05:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
discussing um you know what has has
 
05:29:21.830 --> 05:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
happened historically versus having you
 
05:29:24.430 --> 05:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
know advocating versus instructing
 
05:29:28.350 --> 05:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
versus Etc um these these distinctions
 
05:29:31.948 --> 05:29:31.958 align:start position:0%
as in the fluidity of the classroom in
 
05:29:34.350 --> 05:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
an in an exchange that a teacher is
 
05:29:37.350 --> 05:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
having with the class are really almost
 
05:29:39.310 --> 05:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
impossible to parse and I think that's
 
05:29:42.190 --> 05:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
why we're seeing the conduct of teachers
 
05:29:44.110 --> 05:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
and what the way that teachers are are
 
05:29:47.430 --> 05:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
willing and able um uh to are are
 
05:29:49.830 --> 05:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
needing to um amend their curriculum
 
05:29:51.070 --> 05:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
because they're afraid to getting
 
05:29:54.150 --> 05:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere close to the line um that they
 
05:29:55.708 --> 05:29:55.718 align:start position:0%
are are trying to figure out that the
 
05:29:58.510 --> 05:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
law might me what might be meant in the
 
05:30:02.110 --> 05:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
law um and so you know when you when you
 
05:30:04.030 --> 05:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
you talk to say it's okay to discuss
 
05:30:06.470 --> 05:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
these things well is it okay to discuss
 
05:30:08.910 --> 05:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
why in our country's uh history for
 
05:30:10.910 --> 05:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
example only a single African-American
 
05:30:12.390 --> 05:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
has ever been elected president of the
 
05:30:14.750 --> 05:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
United States and no woman ever has is
 
05:30:17.590 --> 05:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
that okay to discuss in the course of
 
05:30:20.868 --> 05:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
the classroom under this concept can you
 
05:30:23.430 --> 05:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
teach about proven facts that racial and
 
05:30:25.350 --> 05:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
other un unconscious biases have shut
 
05:30:27.190 --> 05:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
the doors of opportunity for many people
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
in our country and continue to do so
 
05:30:31.390 --> 05:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
today you know what is the line between
 
05:30:34.190 --> 05:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
instructing that And discussing that um
 
05:30:37.628 --> 05:30:37.638 align:start position:0%
I think it's impossible and it is
 
05:30:39.510 --> 05:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult for teachers to
 
05:30:41.590 --> 05:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
be able to try to parse what that line
 
05:30:43.868 --> 05:30:43.878 align:start position:0%
might mean especially when their jobs
 
05:30:45.750 --> 05:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
are potentially on the line because of
 
05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
threat and Sh sanctions and threaten um
 
05:30:50.830 --> 05:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuits uh so I think that that the
 
05:30:53.310 --> 05:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
distinction that the law is is asking
 
05:30:55.070 --> 05:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
teachers to make in the course of a
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
fluid classroom is really quite
 
05:30:59.830 --> 05:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
impossible in practice and that's why we
 
05:31:02.910 --> 05:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:08.030 --> 05:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
sh any further questions
 
05:31:11.470 --> 05:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:31:12.910 --> 05:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
question um because teachers are
 
05:31:18.030 --> 05:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
regularly being evaluated for their
 
05:31:18.040 --> 05:31:19.470 align:start position:0%
regularly being evaluated for their
continual

05:31:19.470 --> 05:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
continual
 
05:31:22.270 --> 05:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
employment doesn't this bill because of
 
05:31:26.910 --> 05:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
its vagueness leave open to subjective
 
05:31:30.350 --> 05:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation by the evaluator whether
 
05:31:33.190 --> 05:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill is being
 
05:31:35.390 --> 05:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
violated thank you representative I
 
05:31:38.110 --> 05:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
think um you bring up a very important
 
05:31:40.868 --> 05:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
point because again because the bills
 
05:31:43.230 --> 05:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
the the concepts in the bill about what
 
05:31:46.470 --> 05:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
is banned are so vague uh that they all
 
05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
not only uh leave it open to the subject
 
05:31:50.910 --> 05:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation of whomever might be
 
05:31:53.190 --> 05:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
evaluating whether it's a teacher or in
 
05:31:55.750 --> 05:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
case of 1313 a professor in the
 
05:31:58.310 --> 05:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
University system but it leaves it up to
 
05:32:00.590 --> 05:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
every single individual student in that
 
05:32:02.590 --> 05:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
classroom to make that evaluation and
 
05:32:03.948 --> 05:32:03.958 align:start position:0%
then decide whether or not they're going
 
05:32:07.270 --> 05:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
to file a lawsuit against that um that
 
05:32:09.910 --> 05:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
individual um so yes I think that's the
 
05:32:12.430 --> 05:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
the the the the subjectivity involved in
 
05:32:14.430 --> 05:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
determining what is in fact a violation
 
05:32:17.868 --> 05:32:17.878 align:start position:0%
of this law is a huge part of of why the
 
05:32:20.868 --> 05:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
vagueness is his problem um and why
 
05:32:23.830 --> 05:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
quite frankly that that that that we
 
05:32:25.948 --> 05:32:25.958 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court has held vague
 
05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
laws to be unconstitutional in this
 
05:32:29.040 --> 05:32:30.670 align:start position:0%
laws to be unconstitutional in this
regard

05:32:30.670 --> 05:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
regard
 
05:32:33.788 --> 05:32:33.798 align:start position:0%
luno thank thank you very much Mr chair
 
05:32:35.230 --> 05:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
and first off my apologies to
 
05:32:37.628 --> 05:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
representative laett I'm sorry to
 
05:32:40.628 --> 05:32:40.638 align:start position:0%
interrupted you earlier this afternoon
 
05:32:42.830 --> 05:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and um and thank you for taking my
 
05:32:45.868 --> 05:32:45.878 align:start position:0%
question Miss chaffy um it really sort
 
05:32:48.990 --> 05:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
of goes to um I it sort of follows on
 
05:32:51.430 --> 05:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
what representative Mullen was uh was
 
05:32:54.788 --> 05:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
was leading on earlier where um where
 
05:32:58.270 --> 05:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
where where this bill um um obviously
 
05:33:02.470 --> 05:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
does not amend the four parts a c and d
 
05:33:06.788 --> 05:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
and 19340 part one um and I think a lot
 
05:33:09.150 --> 05:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
of our discussion has centered around a
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
b and c but in Reading D I was wondering
 
05:33:17.270 --> 05:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
if if if you could um provide some some
 
05:33:20.948 --> 05:33:20.958 align:start position:0%
thoughts on on what what D is is going
 
05:33:25.830 --> 05:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry could you provide me with
 
05:33:30.830 --> 05:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
the citation so it's um
 
05:33:34.190 --> 05:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's 19340 which is the the
 
05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
prohibition on teaching discrimination
 
05:33:41.548 --> 05:33:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
section and I don't know if it may be
 
05:33:48.270 --> 05:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
maybe here well no it wouldn't be in
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
here because it's not updated enough
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
um but but I can I can read it so it it
 
05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
begins with um with part two of the
 
05:34:03.788 --> 05:34:03.798 align:start position:0%
bill um and I'll just read the last part
 
05:34:05.990 --> 05:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
of it attending a and no student
 
05:34:07.750 --> 05:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
attending a public postsecondary
 
05:34:09.788 --> 05:34:09.798 align:start position:0%
educational institution shall be taught
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
instructed inculcated or compelled to
 
05:34:15.910 --> 05:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
express belief in or support for any one
 
05:34:18.910 --> 05:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
or more of the following and of the
 
05:34:23.350 --> 05:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
following is an a a b a c and a D and
 
05:34:27.230 --> 05:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
the D reads that people of one age sex
 
05:34:29.868 --> 05:34:29.878 align:start position:0%
gender identity sexual orientation race
 
05:34:32.590 --> 05:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
Creed color marital status familial
 
05:34:34.868 --> 05:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
status mental or physical disability
 
05:34:37.868 --> 05:34:37.878 align:start position:0%
religion or national origin cannot and
 
05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
should not attempt to treat others
 
05:34:45.150 --> 05:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
without regard to age sex gender
 
05:34:47.310 --> 05:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
identity sexual orientation race Creed
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%

05:34:51.910 --> 05:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
physical disability religion natural
 
05:34:58.390 --> 05:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:02.830 --> 05:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to understand how how how
 
05:35:08.070 --> 05:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
this reads so um not inated or compelled
 
05:35:11.548 --> 05:35:11.558 align:start position:0%
to express belief in or support
 
05:35:18.190 --> 05:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
for I'm sort of just you know editing um
 
05:35:24.150 --> 05:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:28.070 --> 05:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
for that people of one age and all that
 
05:35:30.990 --> 05:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
cannot and should not attempt to treat
 
05:35:35.150 --> 05:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
others without regard to all those same
 
05:35:39.510 --> 05:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
conditions I I think that I I think that
 
05:35:41.628 --> 05:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
you are right to be be confused if that
 
05:35:44.110 --> 05:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
is what you are um that is what you are
 
05:35:47.470 --> 05:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
expressing um you know I think it's it's
 
05:35:50.070 --> 05:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
very unclear you know what what that
 
05:35:52.670 --> 05:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
that provision section d means um what
 
05:35:55.150 --> 05:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
does it mean to treat a person without
 
05:35:57.750 --> 05:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
respect to age race sex or disability
 
05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
Etc um I think in in
 
05:36:04.590 --> 05:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:14.070 --> 05:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:16.830 --> 05:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
correctly a double negative in in the
 
05:36:18.948 --> 05:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
sentence right right and so you have you
 
05:36:20.590 --> 05:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
have a double negative here that further
 
05:36:23.830 --> 05:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
confuses what is what is um what is
 
05:36:26.948 --> 05:36:26.958 align:start position:0%
meant uh by that particular
 
05:36:29.708 --> 05:36:29.718 align:start position:0%
prohibition um and so I I think that's
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
that is part of the problem
 
05:36:32.948 --> 05:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
representative is is the confusion that
 
05:36:34.868 --> 05:36:34.878 align:start position:0%
is sewn by the lack of clarity in the
 
05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
language what is that provision trying
 
05:36:39.708 --> 05:36:39.718 align:start position:0%
to get to um and I'd be happy to also um
 
05:36:41.110 --> 05:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
if it's helpful to the committee send
 
05:36:43.390 --> 05:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
the committee a copy we get into this in
 
05:36:46.310 --> 05:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
Greater detail in our filing our
 
05:36:48.350 --> 05:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
complaints um with regards to the
 
05:36:50.830 --> 05:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
underlying law and we go through each
 
05:36:54.590 --> 05:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
specific concept there um I I I wish
 
05:36:56.310 --> 05:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
that our legal director Jill biset could
 
05:36:57.470 --> 05:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
have been with you here today
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he tested Co POS POS
 
05:37:02.548 --> 05:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
yesterday so I am here uh pin shining
 
05:37:04.190 --> 05:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
today but I'd be happy to provide you
 
05:37:06.310 --> 05:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
with a copy of the of the brief that
 
05:37:08.270 --> 05:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
really does go through these Concepts
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
individually but the the gist of of what
 
05:37:12.830 --> 05:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
you will read is is sort of confirming
 
05:37:14.470 --> 05:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative I think what you're what
 
05:37:16.150 --> 05:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
you're referring to which is it's
 
05:37:18.350 --> 05:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly confusing and very difficult
 
05:37:20.708 --> 05:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
to tell what the law is intending to be
 
05:37:22.990 --> 05:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
it terrific um Devon I think that would
 
05:37:24.910 --> 05:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
be that would be a tremendous help to
 
05:37:27.150 --> 05:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
the committee especially as as this
 
05:37:28.990 --> 05:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
committee looks at at the extension of
 
05:37:31.070 --> 05:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
the law to to include public um
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education and and
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
then finally this committee is lucky to
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
have have um Gillis or you any time uh
 
05:37:43.070 --> 05:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
here to testify so thank you very much
 
05:37:44.590 --> 05:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
05:37:53.230 --> 05:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:55.548 --> 05:37:55.558 align:start position:0%
Woodcock ah good I know green with gold
 
05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
and red with st but thank you
 
05:38:01.430 --> 05:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
um here somewhere behind the hidden
 
05:38:04.708 --> 05:38:04.718 align:start position:0%
behind the the head the
 
05:38:07.670 --> 05:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
hello uh thank you so much for coming U
 
05:38:09.868 --> 05:38:09.878 align:start position:0%
I've been listening I listened uh
 
05:38:12.548 --> 05:38:12.558 align:start position:0%
attentively and I was get lost with
 
05:38:14.628 --> 05:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
represent for I thinking about the whole
 
05:38:16.030 --> 05:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
the problem between correlation
 
05:38:18.670 --> 05:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
causation as he was speaking but uh as I
 
05:38:21.230 --> 05:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
started to think about this from uh
 
05:38:23.070 --> 05:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
going back into the classroom as an
 
05:38:25.110 --> 05:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
instructor and going back into the
 
05:38:27.750 --> 05:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
classroom of 12 years of college
 
05:38:30.030 --> 05:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
instructor I would wonder how
 
05:38:33.990 --> 05:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
how based on this law you would present
 
05:38:37.030 --> 05:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
the underlying causes in the topic of
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
the glass
 
05:38:40.350 --> 05:38:40.360 align:start position:0%
ceiling how could you possibly instruct
 
05:38:43.868 --> 05:38:43.878 align:start position:0%
in that that with that topic based on
 
05:38:46.830 --> 05:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
this law I think that's representative
 
05:38:48.270 --> 05:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
Co I think you
 
05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
present a very a very good question you
 
05:38:53.788 --> 05:38:53.798 align:start position:0%
know you know issues like the like the
 
05:38:56.390 --> 05:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
concept of of the glass ceiling of I
 
05:38:58.030 --> 05:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
think the questions there have been a
 
05:39:00.468 --> 05:39:00.478 align:start position:0%
number of questions questions that have
 
05:39:04.230 --> 05:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
been raised um and representative wcky
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
might do a better job than I do of just
 
05:39:08.830 --> 05:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
quickly detailing what theing oh
 
05:39:09.990 --> 05:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
probably not you can go ahead I wouldn't
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
be a violation um per perhaps we could
 
05:39:15.390 --> 05:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
that's really not part of this bill um I
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
think you're addressing what's in
 
05:39:20.110 --> 05:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
current law now so I was talking let me
 
05:39:22.948 --> 05:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
clarify represent thank you for my
 
05:39:25.390 --> 05:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
buying here uh at the postsecondary
 
05:39:27.910 --> 05:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
level was this was this law I was
 
05:39:28.670 --> 05:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
talking that's what I meant the
 
05:39:30.590 --> 05:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
postsecondary level
 
05:39:32.230 --> 05:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative those are exactly the
 
05:39:33.830 --> 05:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
type of questions that we are receiving
 
05:39:36.030 --> 05:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
from Educators is how do I talk about
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
even these most basic concepts um
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
associated with um whether it be racism
 
05:39:44.150 --> 05:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
or sexism whether it be historically or
 
05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
as currently exists in our society how
 
05:39:49.230 --> 05:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
do we talk about these basic concepts um
 
05:39:51.190 --> 05:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
under the current law and and then I
 
05:39:53.110 --> 05:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
think you the concerns that we've heard
 
05:39:55.750 --> 05:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
from secondary uh Educators about what
 
05:39:57.350 --> 05:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
would this mean if it were to apply in
 
05:39:59.868 --> 05:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
the classroom uh at at a second
 
05:40:02.788 --> 05:40:02.798 align:start position:0%
as well I'm sorry postc
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%

here

05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:25.510 --> 05:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe you can fill out a card when
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:28.320 --> 05:40:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:40:41.830 --> 05:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:43.750 --> 05:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right
 
05:40:46.510 --> 05:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman uh members of
 
05:40:48.750 --> 05:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record Brian
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
Hawkins I'm here today representing uh
 
05:40:54.670 --> 05:40:54.680 align:start position:0%

05:41:00.070 --> 05:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh okay okay great um
 
05:41:03.390 --> 05:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
and uh I I will not repeat I'm going to
 
05:41:06.670 --> 05:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
hand in some written testimony from um
 
05:41:08.948 --> 05:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
our president Megan Tuttle so I won't
 
05:41:12.830 --> 05:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
read that but I will do a summary and
 
05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
and uh also would Echo a lot of the
 
05:41:18.190 --> 05:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
things that uh Miss chaffy said
 
05:41:20.708 --> 05:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
earlier here to express Nea New
 
05:41:24.310 --> 05:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's opposition to House Bill
 
05:41:27.390 --> 05:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
1313 this legislation appears to add
 
05:41:30.150 --> 05:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
public postsecondary institutions to law
 
05:41:32.030 --> 05:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
passed in House Bill 2 having to do with
 
05:41:35.830 --> 05:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
ban Concepts now it's no secret that we
 
05:41:38.310 --> 05:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
strongly disagree with the laws passage
 
05:41:40.230 --> 05:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
and also strongly opposed to further
 
05:41:42.430 --> 05:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
expanding it to include public higher
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
education institutions of our state
 
05:41:46.948 --> 05:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
there's going to be other legislation
 
05:41:48.628 --> 05:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
that's going to come forward later in
 
05:41:52.070 --> 05:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
the session um on the current law itself
 
05:41:55.468 --> 05:41:55.478 align:start position:0%
so rather than get into the uh
 
05:41:57.670 --> 05:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty of the of the law that was
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
already passed and its Merit
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
um um I just want to summarize a couple
 
05:42:05.830 --> 05:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
points uh the band Concepts language
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
that is being proposed has already as
 
05:42:10.468 --> 05:42:10.478 align:start position:0%
Miss chaffy indicated created a chill
 
05:42:12.070 --> 05:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
that effectively prevents teachers from
 
05:42:13.788 --> 05:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
doing what Society needs them to do and
 
05:42:16.830 --> 05:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
that's teach our students uh the laws
 
05:42:19.270 --> 05:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
resulted in the curbing of essential
 
05:42:22.468 --> 05:42:22.478 align:start position:0%
teaching practices um such as Competency
 
05:42:26.708 --> 05:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
Based learning critical thinking um but
 
05:42:30.230 --> 05:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
um uh why so why would we want to expand
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
this uh law into uh higher
 
05:42:37.350 --> 05:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
education um and these circumstances
 
05:42:39.868 --> 05:42:39.878 align:start position:0%
mainly stem from the ban Concepts laws
 
05:42:42.510 --> 05:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
ambiguous vague language along with the
 
05:42:44.868 --> 05:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
Steep consequences that can result from
 
05:42:48.868 --> 05:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
running a fou of it the vagueness uh has
 
05:42:50.910 --> 05:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
resulted in the law becoming the subject
 
05:42:52.510 --> 05:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
of two Federal
 
05:42:55.548 --> 05:42:55.558 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um and so it would be premature
 
05:42:58.350 --> 05:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
for us uh to be expanding that until
 
05:43:01.110 --> 05:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
we've gotten some further
 
05:43:05.670 --> 05:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh guidance from from from uh from the
 
05:43:08.548 --> 05:43:08.558 align:start position:0%
courts um also Educators across the
 
05:43:10.948 --> 05:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
state are still grappling with how to
 
05:43:14.548 --> 05:43:14.558 align:start position:0%
follow this law we have asked uh for
 
05:43:17.310 --> 05:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
specific guidance and two letters to
 
05:43:18.590 --> 05:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
both the attorney general and the
 
05:43:19.628 --> 05:43:19.638 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
05:43:22.628 --> 05:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
Education um questions that we've heard
 
05:43:26.708 --> 05:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
from our members um uh so that they can
 
05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
follow the law because we want to follow
 
05:43:34.030 --> 05:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
the law um and th those have gone un
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
unanswered um so with all of this
 
05:43:39.390 --> 05:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
unsettled and people still grappling
 
05:43:43.150 --> 05:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
with how to comply with the law it seems
 
05:43:47.030 --> 05:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
premature to go ahead and expand it
 
05:43:49.868 --> 05:43:49.878 align:start position:0%
um our students uh deserve the freedom
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
to learn they deserve to be part of an
 
05:43:53.948 --> 05:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
education that helps learn from the
 
05:43:56.510 --> 05:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
mistakes of our past so they're better
 
05:43:59.628 --> 05:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
prepared to succeed and um so to inhibit
 
05:44:01.830 --> 05:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's public colleges and
 
05:44:04.230 --> 05:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
University faculty and staff from um
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
engaging in these kinds of discussions
 
05:44:08.788 --> 05:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
to help uh teach and challenge students
 
05:44:11.230 --> 05:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
to use this knowledge uh to form their
 
05:44:13.948 --> 05:44:13.958 align:start position:0%
own opinions um it's a disservice to
 
05:44:15.670 --> 05:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
them and to the state of New Hampshire
 
05:44:17.510 --> 05:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
and so we would respectfully ask that
 
05:44:20.190 --> 05:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
you find House Bill 1313 and expedient
 
05:44:23.310 --> 05:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
to legislate thank you and um if you

want to hand in the written testimony
 
05:44:27.310 --> 05:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
that would be fine you can pass that to
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%

House Bill
 
05:45:05.430 --> 05:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
1313 relative to rights to freedom from
 
05:45:07.628 --> 05:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
discrimination in higher education
 
05:45:10.070 --> 05:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
respectfully ccsnh has significant
 
05:45:12.990 --> 05:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill first with
 
05:45:15.230 --> 05:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
respect to section one the community
 
05:45:17.430 --> 05:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
college system is already considered an
 
05:45:19.590 --> 05:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
employer under RSA
 
05:45:22.270 --> 05:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
354a so it is not clear to us why
 
05:45:24.750 --> 05:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill is necessary it
 
05:45:27.230 --> 05:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
it seems redundant with respect to
 
05:45:29.750 --> 05:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
section two the construction of the
 
05:45:32.230 --> 05:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
section is unusual as it puts language
 
05:45:34.708 --> 05:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
governing the community college system
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
into RSA 193 which pertains generally to
 
05:45:40.590 --> 05:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
pupils in New Hampshire's Elementary and
 
05:45:43.430 --> 05:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
secondary schools nonetheless the
 
05:45:45.628 --> 05:45:45.638 align:start position:0%
substance of the section appears to be
 
05:45:47.788 --> 05:45:47.798 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of public post-secondary
 
05:45:49.628 --> 05:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
education in the prohibitions on
 
05:45:53.708 --> 05:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
teaching discrimination set forth in RSA
 
05:45:56.030 --> 05:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
19340 it's unclear to us how the
 
05:45:58.150 --> 05:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
inclusion of public postsecondary
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
education in those prohibitions he's
 
05:46:03.030 --> 05:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to exist side by side with the
 
05:46:07.230 --> 05:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
existing language in RSA 354 a29 which
 
05:46:09.788 --> 05:46:09.798 align:start position:0%
says nothing in this subdivision shall
 
05:46:11.590 --> 05:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
be construed to limit the academic
 
05:46:13.590 --> 05:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
freedom of Faculty members of the
 
05:46:15.750 --> 05:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire and
 
05:46:17.150 --> 05:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
the community college system of New
 
05:46:19.628 --> 05:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to conduct research publish
 
05:46:23.030 --> 05:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
lecture or teach in the academic setting
 
05:46:25.390 --> 05:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
end quote is it to be the case that
 
05:46:27.150 --> 05:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
nothing in one subdivision shall be
 
05:46:29.030 --> 05:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
construed to limit that academic freedom
 
05:46:32.468 --> 05:46:32.478 align:start position:0%
freedom but House Bill 1313 plac this
 
05:46:34.788 --> 05:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
language in a different subdivision that
 
05:46:36.830 --> 05:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
does limit it we're not sure what that's
 
05:46:38.390 --> 05:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to mean in
 
05:46:41.310 --> 05:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
practice similarly despite the intent of
 
05:46:43.030 --> 05:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
the bill to include public
 
05:46:44.750 --> 05:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education in those
 
05:46:46.868 --> 05:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
prohibitions set forth in
 
05:46:50.788 --> 05:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
19340 the term educator in Roman five of
 
05:46:53.390 --> 05:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
that section remains defined in the K
 
05:46:56.670 --> 05:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
through2 context as for the purposes of
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
this section educator means a profession
 
05:47:01.548 --> 05:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
employee of any school district whose
 
05:47:03.310 --> 05:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
position requires certification by the
 
05:47:05.750 --> 05:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
state board pursuant to RSA
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
18939 administrators Specialists and
 
05:47:09.430 --> 05:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
teachers are included within the
 
05:47:12.070 --> 05:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
definition of this term end quote
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
College faculty did not fall under this
 
05:47:16.548 --> 05:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
definition the violation provision in
 
05:47:18.750 --> 05:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
Roman four refers to sanction by the
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education which does not
 
05:47:22.868 --> 05:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
oversee College faculty this again
 
05:47:24.750 --> 05:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
points to the overall construction of
 
05:47:24.760 --> 05:47:25.628 align:start position:0%
points to the overall construction of
hasel

05:47:25.628 --> 05:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
hasel
 
05:47:28.430 --> 05:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
13113 appearing somewhat convoluted and
 
05:47:30.230 --> 05:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
of unclear
 
05:47:32.590 --> 05:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
applicability that said the general
 
05:47:34.868 --> 05:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
intent to include public post-secondary
 
05:47:36.548 --> 05:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
education under
 
05:47:38.990 --> 05:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
19340 would seem to raise contradictions
 
05:47:40.948 --> 05:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
with widely accepted tenants of academic
 
05:47:43.230 --> 05:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
freedom of college and University
 
05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
faculty regardless of which way one
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
leans on the concept the ambiguities
 
05:47:49.670 --> 05:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
themselves are going to be very
 
05:47:52.910 --> 05:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
problematic hpel 13313 would introduce
 
05:47:54.510 --> 05:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
competing Provisions in New Hampshire
 
05:47:56.510 --> 05:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
law and add to questions about the
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
relationship of this language with con
 
05:48:01.150 --> 05:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
institutional protections we're aware
 
05:48:03.310 --> 05:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
the divisive concept's language passed
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
with respect to K through2 education is
 
05:48:08.390 --> 05:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
already the subject of federal lawsuits
 
05:48:10.110 --> 05:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
that in part challenge the new language
 
05:48:12.788 --> 05:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
on issues of lack of clarity this would
 
05:48:14.750 --> 05:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
seem only more problematic with respect
 
05:48:17.190 --> 05:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
to postsecondary education and the
 
05:48:18.670 --> 05:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
freedoms that are historically part of
 
05:48:20.070 --> 05:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
the college
 
05:48:22.270 --> 05:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
environment we are very interested in
 
05:48:24.670 --> 05:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
not curbing the free flow of ideas that
 
05:48:26.670 --> 05:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
should characterize post-secondary
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
education we believe our faculty
 
05:48:31.310 --> 05:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
encourage open and critical thinking we
 
05:48:32.868 --> 05:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
are not aware of any assertions that
 
05:48:35.110 --> 05:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
they have used their role to compel
 
05:48:37.750 --> 05:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
belief in or support for particular
 
05:48:39.628 --> 05:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
agendas or that students have been
 
05:48:41.390 --> 05:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
denied exposure to the marketplace of
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
ideas on the contrary we believe the
 
05:48:46.150 --> 05:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
general fear is that legislation like
 
05:48:48.948 --> 05:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
hille 1313 would in fact lead to
 
05:48:51.670 --> 05:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
constraints on the free flow of ideas we
 
05:48:53.310 --> 05:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
would hope that the legislature not take
 
05:48:55.510 --> 05:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
a step that will lead to uncertainty and
 
05:48:57.590 --> 05:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
conflict over academic freedom that
 
05:48:59.510 --> 05:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
students and faculty Both Deserve and to
 
05:49:02.430 --> 05:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
which they have a right thank you happy
 
05:49:04.628 --> 05:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you any
 
05:49:06.788 --> 05:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss
 
05:49:09.708 --> 05:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
Reed see none thank you very
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:21.150 --> 05:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
Cronin uh good afternoon again Mr
 
05:49:22.270 --> 05:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
05:49:23.548 --> 05:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
Tom Cronin director of government
 
05:49:25.948 --> 05:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
relations for the University system
 
05:49:28.150 --> 05:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for having us in on house
 
05:49:31.230 --> 05:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
bill3 1413 um I'll keep my testimony
 
05:49:34.510 --> 05:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
brief um we are largely in agreement
 
05:49:36.190 --> 05:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
with many of the all of the points I
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
think that uh Miss Reed just laid out on
 
05:49:40.150 --> 05:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
behalf of the community college system
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh with relation to the construction of
 
05:49:45.510 --> 05:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
the the legislation uh again agreed uh
 
05:49:47.150 --> 05:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill seems
 
05:49:49.990 --> 05:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary uh we believe usnh as well
 
05:49:52.590 --> 05:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
as ccsnh uh already fall under the
 
05:49:55.468 --> 05:49:55.478 align:start position:0%
definition of Quasi public entities um
 
05:49:56.948 --> 05:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
we believe we are a covered employer we
 
05:49:59.110 --> 05:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
accept we are a covered employer
 
05:50:02.430 --> 05:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
um section two of the bill uh adds
 
05:50:06.670 --> 05:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
postsecondary language to RSA 193 um as
 
05:50:08.110 --> 05:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
you all are well aware that is the
 
05:50:09.468 --> 05:50:09.478 align:start position:0%
section of Statute governing Public
 
05:50:11.510 --> 05:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
Schools higher education is governed
 
05:50:13.510 --> 05:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in statute uh I think Miss
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
Reed did a fantastic job of laying out
 
05:50:17.190 --> 05:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
the inconsistencies that follow as a
 
05:50:20.430 --> 05:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
result and then third um as you all know
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
again when the legislature enacted the
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
freedom from discrimination law they
 
05:50:26.270 --> 05:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
codified a clear provision protecting
 
05:50:28.150 --> 05:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
academic freedom um I'll read it one
 
05:50:29.350 --> 05:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
more time time nothing in this
 
05:50:31.310 --> 05:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
subdivision shall be construed to limit
 
05:50:33.468 --> 05:50:33.478 align:start position:0%
the academic freedom of Faculty members
 
05:50:34.788 --> 05:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
of the University system of New
 
05:50:36.230 --> 05:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the community college
 
05:50:37.910 --> 05:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire to conduct
 
05:50:40.590 --> 05:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
research publish lecture or teach in the
 
05:50:44.468 --> 05:50:44.478 align:start position:0%
academic setting um it's unclear because
 
05:50:47.070 --> 05:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
that uh protection sits in the
 
05:50:48.390 --> 05:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
commission on human rights section of
 
05:50:51.590 --> 05:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
law again so how it all necessarily fits
 
05:50:53.670 --> 05:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
together here is I think incredibly
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
unclear but regardless I think
 
05:51:01.548 --> 05:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
that lack of clarity and what is likely
 
05:51:03.390 --> 05:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to be the intent based on the
 
05:51:04.990 --> 05:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor's
 
05:51:07.030 --> 05:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
testimony is to have just a clear
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on classroom instruction
 
05:51:12.190 --> 05:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh there's no doubt that passing this
 
05:51:13.948 --> 05:51:13.958 align:start position:0%
law will lead to a proliferation of
 
05:51:16.270 --> 05:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against the state's colleges
 
05:51:18.590 --> 05:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
and universities um from students who
 
05:51:20.390 --> 05:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
feel as though they have been assigned
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
or are in some way wronged by something
 
05:51:25.310 --> 05:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
an academic or a professor or teacher
 
05:51:28.390 --> 05:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
says to them um that I think is our
 
05:51:32.310 --> 05:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
biggest concern uh it does not seem to
 
05:51:36.110 --> 05:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
be a productive step forward um in how
 
05:51:38.510 --> 05:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
we ensure academic freedom free speech
 
05:51:40.468 --> 05:51:40.478 align:start position:0%
on our campuses uh and the free exchange
 
05:51:42.750 --> 05:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
of ideas so maybe with that I'll stop
 
05:51:44.468 --> 05:51:44.478 align:start position:0%
and would of course be happy to take any
 
05:51:48.670 --> 05:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions for Mr
 
05:51:51.310 --> 05:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
Cronin repr
 
05:51:53.590 --> 05:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:51:56.990 --> 05:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
Mr K for taking my question um going
 
05:52:00.030 --> 05:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
back to our first speaker about how uh
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
College professors um you know say you
 
05:52:07.628 --> 05:52:07.638 align:start position:0%
know I have this Theory or I have this
 
05:52:10.948 --> 05:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
belief and uh you have to regurgitate it
 
05:52:13.070 --> 05:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
to me or not get an A you you know
 
05:52:16.430 --> 05:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
you'll get a lower grade or you know uh
 
05:52:18.708 --> 05:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
there's only one way to to deal with
 
05:52:21.670 --> 05:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
this subject and and so if you take my
 
05:52:25.270 --> 05:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
class that's how you do it okay um seems
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
like it's more pedagogy than um content
 
05:52:30.548 --> 05:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here but I was
 
05:52:33.708 --> 05:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
wondering if the university system has a
 
05:52:36.190 --> 05:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
way for students that are caught in that
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
situation that that feel as though
 
05:52:41.948 --> 05:52:41.958 align:start position:0%
they've been unduly discriminated
 
05:52:46.548 --> 05:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
against um how they uh can have recourse
 
05:52:48.830 --> 05:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
of course thank you for the question and
 
05:52:50.708 --> 05:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
that actually gives me an opportunity
 
05:52:52.910 --> 05:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
maybe to speak to I
 
05:52:55.150 --> 05:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
think what seems to be a pervasive
 
05:52:56.910 --> 05:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
thought in this that faculty members at
 
05:52:58.990 --> 05:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
the University and other ways other
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
places are are forcing an ideology on
 
05:53:03.350 --> 05:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
students I mean we've heard this before
 
05:53:06.510 --> 05:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
of course uh our Administration our
 
05:53:08.708 --> 05:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
faculty are committed to a set of
 
05:53:11.070 --> 05:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
ethical principles in their work um
 
05:53:13.510 --> 05:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
there it is the American Association of
 
05:53:15.150 --> 05:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
University professors they have a
 
05:53:18.350 --> 05:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
detailed uh ethics manual that speaks to
 
05:53:19.910 --> 05:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
a range of topics but one of them really
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
is this and if I could just read uh a
 
05:53:25.150 --> 05:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
quickish excer uh indoctrination occurs
 
05:53:27.270 --> 05:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
when instructors dogmatically insist on
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
the truth of such propositions by
 
05:53:31.030 --> 05:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
refusing to Accord their students the
 
05:53:32.830 --> 05:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to contest them
 
05:53:34.430 --> 05:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
indoctrination occurs when instructors
 
05:53:36.590 --> 05:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
assert such propositions and ways that
 
05:53:38.430 --> 05:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
prevent students from expressing
 
05:53:40.948 --> 05:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
disagreement vigorously to assert a
 
05:53:42.590 --> 05:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
proposition or Viewpoint however
 
05:53:44.548 --> 05:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
controversial is to engage in
 
05:53:46.708 --> 05:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
argumentation and discussion an
 
05:53:48.430 --> 05:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
engagement that lies at the core of
 
05:53:50.628 --> 05:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
academic freedom such engagement is
 
05:53:52.190 --> 05:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
essential if students are to acquire
 
05:53:54.510 --> 05:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
skills of critical Independence the
 
05:53:56.310 --> 05:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
essence of higher education does not lie
 
05:53:58.510 --> 05:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
in the passive transmission of knowledge
 
05:54:00.548 --> 05:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
but in the inculcation of a mature
 
05:54:02.830 --> 05:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
independence of mind and I think that
 
05:54:04.548 --> 05:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
really gets to your point that that is
 
05:54:06.468 --> 05:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
that is the the code of ethics that our
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
faculty uh commit to live by in the
 
05:54:10.708 --> 05:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
event that a student feels like he or
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
she is is being graded unfairly uh is
 
05:54:14.750 --> 05:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
being treated poorly in a class
 
05:54:17.868 --> 05:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
certainly there are processes to uh make
 
05:54:20.150 --> 05:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
complaints to file appeals on grading
 
05:54:23.590 --> 05:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
Etc that would in in theory surface
 
05:54:25.708 --> 05:54:25.718 align:start position:0%
issues like that that would lead to
 
05:54:28.510 --> 05:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
conversations uh within if if it gets to
 
05:54:31.390 --> 05:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
that stage a disciplinary context um for
 
05:54:33.070 --> 05:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
a faculty member who is clearly acting
 
05:54:35.548 --> 05:54:35.558 align:start position:0%
outside of that well defined and agreed
 
05:54:37.150 --> 05:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
upon code of
 
05:54:41.150 --> 05:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
effs thank you anything further if not
 
05:54:44.110 --> 05:54:44.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for testifying again
 
05:54:46.948 --> 05:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
and the final speaker we have listed is
 
05:54:46.958 --> 05:54:56.430 align:start position:0%
and the final speaker we have listed is
Louise

05:54:56.430 --> 05:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:06.350 --> 05:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:09.708 --> 05:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
here um hi thank you Mr Vice chair for
 
05:55:12.510 --> 05:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony and um to all the
 
05:55:14.750 --> 05:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
committee members here today my name is
 
05:55:17.948 --> 05:55:17.958 align:start position:0%
Louise Spencer I'm co-founder of an all
 
05:55:20.150 --> 05:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer Grassroots advocacy group
 
05:55:23.110 --> 05:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:28.070 --> 05:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
Coalition um and although um I would
 
05:55:29.430 --> 05:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
that most of the members of our group
 
05:55:31.910 --> 05:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
would agree with my comments here today
 
05:55:36.030 --> 05:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh I speak on my own behalf um
 
05:55:40.830 --> 05:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
so many people who speak in favor of
 
05:55:43.948 --> 05:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
this legislation and the addition to it
 
05:55:46.510 --> 05:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
quote Martin Luther King Jr's I Have a
 
05:55:50.788 --> 05:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
Dream speech with the um idea that we've
 
05:55:55.990 --> 05:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
already achieved that goal and it's your
 
05:55:58.868 --> 05:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
right to make that argument but many
 
05:56:01.910 --> 05:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
disagree that we have achieved a state
 
05:56:04.310 --> 05:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
where we are not judged by the color of
 
05:56:10.868 --> 05:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
our skin or our sex or our gender or our
 
05:56:13.548 --> 05:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
disabilities and that's kind of the
 
05:56:17.110 --> 05:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
point really that we disagree and we can
 
05:56:20.750 --> 05:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
have discussions and we can argue and
 
05:56:24.310 --> 05:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill would shut down is
 
05:56:27.468 --> 05:56:27.478 align:start position:0%
that very discussion about where we are
 
05:56:30.990 --> 05:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
with race relations in this country and
 
05:56:35.110 --> 05:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
where we are with uh sexual equality and
 
05:56:37.708 --> 05:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
gender equality
 
05:56:40.548 --> 05:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
um all across the board all the
 
05:56:43.868 --> 05:56:43.878 align:start position:0%
categories that are um spoken to I'm not
 
05:56:45.990 --> 05:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
sure why I'm so nervous today speaking
 
05:56:48.628 --> 05:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
usually I'm not but I'm feeling nervous
 
05:56:51.270 --> 05:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps because I feel so passionately
 
05:56:53.990 --> 05:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
about this bill and one of the greatest
 
05:56:56.430 --> 05:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
things I achieved out of my college
 
05:56:59.350 --> 05:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
education was the ability to have these
 
05:57:02.708 --> 05:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
very difficult and painful discussions
 
05:57:02.718 --> 05:57:03.548 align:start position:0%
very difficult and painful discussions
at

05:57:03.548 --> 05:57:03.558 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:57:06.670 --> 05:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
times that really is the best of what a
 
05:57:10.110 --> 05:57:10.120 align:start position:0%
college education can offer I do not
 
05:57:13.150 --> 05:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
need to agree with my professor nor does
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
my professor need to agree with me the
 
05:57:19.270 --> 05:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
point is that we engage in discussion
 
05:57:21.310 --> 05:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
and we do it with
 
05:57:24.510 --> 05:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
respect that's the value of a secondary
 
05:57:24.520 --> 05:57:26.310 align:start position:0%
respect that's the value of a secondary
postsecondary

05:57:26.310 --> 05:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
postsecondary
 
05:57:28.830 --> 05:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
education um
 
05:57:32.468 --> 05:57:32.478 align:start position:0%
I would just like to read the full quote
 
05:57:33.390 --> 05:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
U Miss
 
05:57:38.750 --> 05:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
chii uh gave part of it but I'd like to
 
05:57:40.750 --> 05:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
read a full quote from do Dr Martin
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
Luther King it says um whites it must
 
05:57:47.628 --> 05:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
frankly be said are not putting in a
 
05:57:50.350 --> 05:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
similar mass effort to re-educate
 
05:57:52.708 --> 05:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
themselves out of their racial ignorance
 
05:57:54.628 --> 05:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
it is an aspect of their sense of
 
05:57:57.310 --> 05:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
superiority that white people of America
 
05:57:59.150 --> 05:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
believe that they have so little to
 
05:58:01.868 --> 05:58:01.878 align:start position:0%
learn the reality of substantial
 
05:58:04.310 --> 05:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
investment to assist Negroes into the
 
05:58:06.830 --> 05:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
20th century adjusting to negro
 
05:58:09.628 --> 05:58:09.638 align:start position:0%
neighbors and genuine integration is
 
05:58:12.150 --> 05:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
still a nightmare for all too many white
 
05:58:14.548 --> 05:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
Americans these are the deepest causes
 
05:58:17.230 --> 05:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
for contemporary abrasions between the
 
05:58:19.948 --> 05:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
races loose and easy language about
 
05:58:23.150 --> 05:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
equality resonant resolutions about
 
05:58:25.548 --> 05:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
Brotherhood uh resonant resolutions
 
05:58:27.830 --> 05:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
about Brotherhood fall pleasantly on the
 
05:58:29.990 --> 05:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
ear but for the Negro there is a
 
05:58:32.830 --> 05:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
credibility gap he cannot Overlook he
 
05:58:35.310 --> 05:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
remembers that with each modest Advance
 
05:58:37.548 --> 05:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
the white population promptly raises the
 
05:58:40.110 --> 05:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
argument that the Negro has come far
 
05:58:42.990 --> 05:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
enough each step forward accents an
 
05:58:46.948 --> 05:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
everpresent tendency to backlash that
 
05:58:49.350 --> 05:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
was remarks delivered by Martin Luther
 
05:58:51.030 --> 05:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
King Jr in
 
05:58:53.670 --> 05:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
1967 now Les we doubt that he might
 
05:58:55.868 --> 05:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
still hold those beliefs today or
 
05:58:59.510 --> 05:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
similar beliefs his daughter Bernie King
 
05:59:02.190 --> 05:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
has made very clear that she finds these
 
05:59:06.350 --> 05:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
bills that are anti-crt and that attempt
 
05:59:09.830 --> 05:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
to shut down the discussions of ongoing
 
05:59:13.110 --> 05:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
racial institutional discrimination and
 
05:59:16.390 --> 05:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
bias in our country which is really um
 
05:59:18.948 --> 05:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
what CRT attempts to address it's not
 
05:59:20.948 --> 05:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
about individuals being racist it's
 
05:59:20.958 --> 05:59:22.310 align:start position:0%
about individuals being racist it's
about

05:59:22.310 --> 05:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:59:27.390 --> 05:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
institutions um and she has said that
 
05:59:29.750 --> 05:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
she quite frankly finds it insulting
 
05:59:32.230 --> 05:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
that the words of her father are used to
 
05:59:34.468 --> 05:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
support this sort of
 
05:59:37.310 --> 05:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and that her father's Works
 
05:59:39.270 --> 05:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
need to be looked at
 
05:59:41.910 --> 05:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
holistically again we can discuss and
 
05:59:45.230 --> 05:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
argue those points but it raises the
 
05:59:48.150 --> 05:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
question if Martin Luther King Jr were
 
05:59:50.990 --> 05:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
still alive today and this bill were
 
05:59:53.868 --> 05:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
passed and he were invited to speak as a
 
05:59:57.708 --> 05:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
guest lecturer a professor at UNH with
 
06:00:00.190 --> 06:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
he be subjected to the sanctions of this
 
06:00:02.310 --> 06:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
bill and I think the answer to that
 
06:00:05.030 --> 06:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
question is yes so thank you very much
 
06:00:08.750 --> 06:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
and I will take questions thank you any
 
06:00:12.830 --> 06:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss Spencer see none okay
 
06:00:12.840 --> 06:00:14.230 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss Spencer see none okay
representative

06:00:14.230 --> 06:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:00:16.830 --> 06:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Miss Spencer
 
06:00:19.670 --> 06:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
for for being with us this afternoon and
 
06:00:23.510 --> 06:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and when um when you were just sort
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
of laying this out it reminded me of
 
06:00:28.190 --> 06:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
something that I heard heard actually
 
06:00:31.270 --> 06:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
this morning on on NPR while I was
 
06:00:32.910 --> 06:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
driving in here you may have heard the
 
06:00:35.830 --> 06:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
same the same thing but uh they were
 
06:00:39.270 --> 06:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
talking the the um the the story was was
 
06:00:41.868 --> 06:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
basically about a um and there is a
 
06:00:43.948 --> 06:00:43.958 align:start position:0%
question that's G come into this I
 
06:00:49.030 --> 06:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:53.190 --> 06:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
but but um um it it was actually it was
 
06:00:54.468 --> 06:00:54.478 align:start position:0%
very interesting it's about the Hubble
 
06:00:56.830 --> 06:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
telescope which uh you know has been up
 
06:00:59.868 --> 06:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
there a while it's been recently uh um
 
06:01:02.750 --> 06:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
replaced by by a new launch but anyway
 
06:01:05.830 --> 06:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
every year for about the last 25 or so
 
06:01:08.070 --> 06:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
years that the hubbles telescope has
 
06:01:10.830 --> 06:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
been in in operation NASA receives about
 
06:01:14.548 --> 06:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
1100 applications to run experiments on
 
06:01:15.750 --> 06:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
the Hubble and they come from
 
06:01:18.030 --> 06:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
universities all across you know
 
06:01:19.350 --> 06:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
certainly the United States but across
 
06:01:23.390 --> 06:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
the globe and um and anyway somebody a
 
06:01:26.910 --> 06:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
few years ago asked GE can you give us
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
an idea is to the number of applications
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
that come from from male principal
 
06:01:34.868 --> 06:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
investigators versus female principal
 
06:01:37.150 --> 06:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
investigators and ones that are approved
 
06:01:38.430 --> 06:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
anyway they hadn't been they've been
 
06:01:39.670 --> 06:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
collecting the information but they
 
06:01:42.990 --> 06:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
never analyzed that so they were able to
 
06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
um go back and inferring actually they
 
06:01:49.390 --> 06:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
didn't collect the the gender
 
06:01:52.708 --> 06:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
information but they uh they did have
 
06:01:54.788 --> 06:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
the names and they were Bas basically
 
06:01:58.150 --> 06:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
inferring based on names and they found
 
06:02:01.270 --> 06:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
consistently for every year and this is
 
06:02:03.350 --> 06:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
these are academic institutions
 
06:02:06.510 --> 06:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
approximately a six or 7% biased towards
 
06:02:09.150 --> 06:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
male scientists versus female scientists
 
06:02:12.590 --> 06:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
who are submitting these applications so
 
06:02:15.788 --> 06:02:15.798 align:start position:0%
recently uh they made a change and they
 
06:02:18.628 --> 06:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
hid the names of the principal
 
06:02:21.990 --> 06:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
investigators and guess what the number
 
06:02:24.868 --> 06:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
of female principal investigators
 
06:02:27.030 --> 06:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
actually ex receiving applications
 
06:02:29.110 --> 06:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
actually went up and it happened in year
 
06:02:32.590 --> 06:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
one and it was dramatic and my question
 
06:02:34.430 --> 06:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
06:02:36.868 --> 06:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
is how
 
06:02:41.310 --> 06:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
would policies like this interfere with
 
06:02:45.310 --> 06:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
with with um with the ability to make
 
06:02:49.110 --> 06:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
change in society to to try to level the
 
06:02:52.270 --> 06:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
playing field for um for and I'm just
 
06:02:56.270 --> 06:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
picking male and female but obviously
 
06:02:59.310 --> 06:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
other please reply quickly because I
 
06:03:01.788 --> 06:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
think we're strained a little from uh
 
06:03:05.190 --> 06:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
the actual bill itself and we are a
 
06:03:06.910 --> 06:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
little bit behind schedu specifically
 
06:03:08.750 --> 06:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
for higher education yeah I think it
 
06:03:10.868 --> 06:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
impacts second postsecondary education
 
06:03:12.590 --> 06:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
particularly because that's where grants
 
06:03:17.350 --> 06:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
and other issues are made and um are um
 
06:03:20.350 --> 06:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
have the most relevance um I think you
 
06:03:23.990 --> 06:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
also see it with for example UNH with
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
they have a public health program um
 
06:03:31.390 --> 06:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
they have um there's a law school uh
 
06:03:35.868 --> 06:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
looking at issues can we ever make take
 
06:03:39.150 --> 06:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
into account differences of
 
06:03:43.310 --> 06:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
experiences um based on a person's um
 
06:03:45.468 --> 06:03:45.478 align:start position:0%
you know whe their sex their
 
06:03:49.548 --> 06:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh can we sort for that to
 
06:03:52.510 --> 06:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are providing equal
 
06:03:55.948 --> 06:03:55.958 align:start position:0%
opportunities for all um again that
 
06:03:57.868 --> 06:03:57.878 align:start position:0%
might sometimes make people
 
06:03:59.670 --> 06:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable to realize that that's
 
06:04:02.310 --> 06:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
been done in the past and um that there
 
06:04:04.150 --> 06:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
has been discrimination in the past and
 
06:04:05.910 --> 06:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
there could be ongoing discrimination
 
06:04:09.628 --> 06:04:09.638 align:start position:0%
but we are better when we um learn from
 
06:04:12.350 --> 06:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
that and and try to correct for it
 
06:04:15.708 --> 06:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
rather than try to argue that it doesn't
 
06:04:19.390 --> 06:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
exist thank you very much l and I think
 
06:04:19.400 --> 06:04:20.948 align:start position:0%
exist thank you very much l and I think
that

06:04:20.948 --> 06:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:04:24.750 --> 06:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
ends the uh testimony on this bill and
 
06:04:29.110 --> 06:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
we will move um on to to House Bill
 
06:04:33.070 --> 06:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
1685 and I see representative uh Mooney
 
06:04:35.788 --> 06:04:35.798 align:start position:0%
here and uh sorry that uh we're a little
 
06:04:38.708 --> 06:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
bit behind schedule for you no problem
 
06:04:40.350 --> 06:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman in fact I'm very grateful
 
06:04:42.788 --> 06:04:42.798 align:start position:0%

and be heard has been given that
 
06:04:48.270 --> 06:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity despite a time lag so I'm
 
06:04:51.788 --> 06:04:51.798 align:start position:0%

program in the Department of Education
 
06:05:43.948 --> 06:05:43.958 align:start position:0%
this bill would add a new section to the

school money section which is RSA
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%

06:07:54.830 --> 06:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
and 19 and to do my best to uh conserve
 
06:07:57.830 --> 06:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
on paper my amendment is on the back
 
06:08:01.230 --> 06:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
side of my written testimony you'll see
 
06:08:04.110 --> 06:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
on line uh
 
06:08:06.628 --> 06:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
17 there is
 
06:08:10.430 --> 06:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh a better way for that to be
 
06:08:14.830 --> 06:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
worded so that would then uh instead of
 
06:08:16.750 --> 06:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
reading the loan should cover costs
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
which are not eligible for funding via
 
06:08:22.270 --> 06:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
it would simply read the loan should
 
06:08:26.030 --> 06:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
cover costs which are not funded by
 
06:08:28.590 --> 06:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
existing state and federal
 
06:08:31.750 --> 06:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
programs and the second part of my
 
06:08:34.750 --> 06:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment uh takes out an extra
 
06:08:38.270 --> 06:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
word there in line number 19 with that I
 
06:08:41.070 --> 06:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
am going to conclude my testimony I know
 
06:08:43.270 --> 06:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
the logistics of such uh will be
 
06:08:46.670 --> 06:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
testified on by uh individuals who make
 
06:08:50.350 --> 06:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
remarks uh Beyond me and so for that i'
 
06:08:52.468 --> 06:08:52.478 align:start position:0%
bring that up I conclude my testimony I
 
06:08:53.788 --> 06:08:53.798 align:start position:0%
want to thank you all certainly for
 
06:08:55.830 --> 06:08:55.840 align:start position:0%

the committee here we have the option
 
06:09:09.708 --> 06:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
here of taking several others right now
 
06:09:12.270 --> 06:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
to testify we could get Amy Clark from
 
06:09:14.230 --> 06:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
the Department offering technical
 
06:09:16.390 --> 06:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
assistance on the bill if we so desire
 
06:09:18.110 --> 06:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
to hear that before we hear the
 
06:09:22.750 --> 06:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
others any interest she's here she's
 
06:09:25.310 --> 06:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
here could I weigh in on that as well or
 
06:09:27.230 --> 06:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
if yes go ahead my SU just is to have
 
06:09:29.868 --> 06:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
Amy Clark testify after me uh that's
 
06:09:32.868 --> 06:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to get Bo so we are
 
06:09:35.708 --> 06:09:35.718 align:start position:0%
going to invite Amy are you sitting here

this yes represent um thanks very much
 
06:10:31.750 --> 06:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thanks very much Miss Clark I
 
06:10:35.070 --> 06:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
know just recently um we um uh put
 
06:10:37.830 --> 06:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
forward legislation I think it probably
 
06:10:40.310 --> 06:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully made its uh way through
 
06:10:43.150 --> 06:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
through the process that um that
 
06:10:47.750 --> 06:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
established a um uh an application um or
 
06:10:50.390 --> 06:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
process for the Department to withdraw
 
06:10:53.350 --> 06:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
funds or to apply for funds from the
 
06:10:56.070 --> 06:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
infr the infrastructure from the
 
06:10:58.910 --> 06:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund to be used for um
 
06:11:02.150 --> 06:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
for engineering assessment and um and
 
06:11:02.160 --> 06:11:03.548 align:start position:0%
for engineering assessment and um and
project

06:11:03.548 --> 06:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
project
 
06:11:07.708 --> 06:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
prioritization um I guess does is would
 
06:11:11.310 --> 06:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
would this um proposal be consistent
 
06:11:14.190 --> 06:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
with that type of um uh effort going
 
06:11:17.948 --> 06:11:17.958 align:start position:0%
forward or is it some sort of parallel
 
06:11:20.990 --> 06:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
um you know planning effort that uh
 
06:11:23.390 --> 06:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
would be funded and districts would take
 
06:11:26.628 --> 06:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
up independently um probably the
 
06:11:29.310 --> 06:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
probably two separate things so um I
 
06:11:30.910 --> 06:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
believe what you're referring to is the
 
06:11:32.910 --> 06:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
facility assessment the goal it would be
 
06:11:34.350 --> 06:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
for the state to assess school
 
06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
facilities um all public schools charg
 
06:11:39.590 --> 06:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
schools obviously included uh in that
 
06:11:41.868 --> 06:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
and so that gives the schools um and the
 
06:11:44.788 --> 06:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
state an an opportunity to plan better
 
06:11:47.708 --> 06:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
of what to do with funds um and the
 
06:11:50.230 --> 06:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
state of our schools right but I think
 
06:11:53.510 --> 06:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill really is to um
 
06:11:57.270 --> 06:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
say a school is ready to do something
 
06:11:59.310 --> 06:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
um but the application process isn't
 
06:12:01.310 --> 06:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
something that you can just do overnight
 
06:12:03.150 --> 06:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
um apply for building Aid you really
 
06:12:04.990 --> 06:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
have to put a lot of planning involved
 
06:12:07.548 --> 06:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
so you have to decide whether it's um
 
06:12:10.270 --> 06:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
makes sense to just continue on without
 
06:12:11.830 --> 06:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
rebuilding or maybe you want to do a
 
06:12:13.548 --> 06:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
renovation maybe you want to do an
 
06:12:15.590 --> 06:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
addition what are your educational needs
 
06:12:17.030 --> 06:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
in that building and how are they not
 
06:12:19.628 --> 06:12:19.638 align:start position:0%
being met so I think that this really is
 
06:12:22.990 --> 06:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
to focus on a project specific versus
 
06:12:25.948 --> 06:12:25.958 align:start position:0%
the assessment of but they certainly
 
06:12:25.958 --> 06:12:27.350 align:start position:0%
the assessment of but they certainly
dovea

06:12:27.350 --> 06:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
dovea
 
06:12:30.110 --> 06:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
sure on on a follow up on that Mr chair
 
06:12:33.030 --> 06:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't the existing um uh
 
06:12:34.868 --> 06:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
application process support both
 
06:12:38.390 --> 06:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
planning projects as well as um the
 
06:12:41.670 --> 06:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
capital you know project as
 
06:12:44.070 --> 06:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
well the infrastructure fund has we
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
develop you if you don't mind yeah yeah
 
06:12:49.590 --> 06:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah um there there was $2 million
 
06:12:52.708 --> 06:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
allocated this previous B for this bium
 
06:12:54.708 --> 06:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
of which there's another million dollars
 
06:12:57.150 --> 06:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
which has been added in so there's the
 
06:12:58.990 --> 06:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
money which carried forward and so we're
 
06:13:00.868 --> 06:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
talking about roughly around three a
 
06:13:02.468 --> 06:13:02.478 align:start position:0%
little over $3
 
06:13:05.430 --> 06:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
million we also within the legislation
 
06:13:07.150 --> 06:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
that represented ly was speaking to and
 
06:13:09.830 --> 06:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused on this myself is
 
06:13:12.910 --> 06:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
that we're driving home for a 10year
 
06:13:16.110 --> 06:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
plan in terms of our capital projects to
 
06:13:18.830 --> 06:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
get on that list after we do the
 
06:13:22.948 --> 06:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
assessment this uh legislation is
 
06:13:24.628 --> 06:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
talking about facility Improvement
 
06:13:26.910 --> 06:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
projects including but not Li lied to
 
06:13:29.468 --> 06:13:29.478 align:start position:0%
projects eligible for school building
 
06:13:32.628 --> 06:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
Aid I believe the legislation that we
 
06:13:36.708 --> 06:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
just passed said in order to get on that
 
06:13:38.830 --> 06:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
to get be eligible for building Aid
 
06:13:40.468 --> 06:13:40.478 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to be on that on
 
06:13:40.478 --> 06:13:41.670 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to be on that on
that

06:13:41.670 --> 06:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
list now here's something is saying
 
06:13:46.628 --> 06:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't have to be on that
 
06:13:49.430 --> 06:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
list so I I think the two separate
 
06:13:50.948 --> 06:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
things would be that the public school
 
06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund that $3.3 million is
 
06:13:57.110 --> 06:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
I think the goal would be to create A
 
06:13:59.548 --> 06:13:59.558 align:start position:0%
ranked a list of the school facilities
 
06:14:01.350 --> 06:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
and how they're doing and if you're
 
06:14:03.390 --> 06:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
interested in implying from building Aid
 
06:14:05.110 --> 06:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
one of those things may be that you have
 
06:14:07.868 --> 06:14:07.878 align:start position:0%
to be uh assessed through that program
 
06:14:09.788 --> 06:14:09.798 align:start position:0%
prior to applying so that we really have
 
06:14:12.910 --> 06:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
an understanding of um what that
 
06:14:14.788 --> 06:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
building already the condition of that
 
06:14:15.990 --> 06:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
building so that people don't waste
 
06:14:18.190 --> 06:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
their time applying for that but I think
 
06:14:22.030 --> 06:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
what this is trying to do is um help
 
06:14:23.868 --> 06:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
districts that may not have those
 
06:14:25.948 --> 06:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
resources whether they be Public School
 
06:14:28.670 --> 06:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
District or public um Charter Schools
 
06:14:31.910 --> 06:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
put together an application by hiring an
 
06:14:34.230 --> 06:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
architect um doing all that planning
 
06:14:36.430 --> 06:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
that is involved in putting together a
 
06:14:39.110 --> 06:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
building aid application um so this is
 
06:14:43.070 --> 06:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
like the um this is the state revolving
 
06:14:46.350 --> 06:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
fund that would assist a school district
 
06:14:48.548 --> 06:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
in putting together that application
 
06:14:50.310 --> 06:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
once they decide that that's what they
 
06:14:52.548 --> 06:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
want to move forward with whereas the
 
06:14:54.350 --> 06:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
rank the public school infrastructure
 
06:14:56.788 --> 06:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
fund that
 
06:14:59.708 --> 06:14:59.718 align:start position:0%
is really to the picture of the state
 
06:15:01.750 --> 06:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
and all the school facilities in their
 
06:15:04.030 --> 06:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
condition um whether they're going to
 
06:15:09.270 --> 06:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:12.910 --> 06:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
district I'm sort of halfway there with
 
06:15:17.430 --> 06:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
you um my concern I guess is
 
06:15:20.270 --> 06:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
that when you're on the list and you
 
06:15:22.230 --> 06:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're then going forward
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
with your
 
06:15:26.750 --> 06:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
application if your application awarded
 
06:15:29.628 --> 06:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
do you get reimbursed for the cost
 
06:15:31.670 --> 06:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
associated with putting that application
 
06:15:34.030 --> 06:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
together I would say yes
 
06:15:37.270 --> 06:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes you get reimbursed from the school
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
building aid appliation funds that you
 
06:15:45.030 --> 06:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
receed not from I a fund such as this
 
06:15:47.150 --> 06:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
cor correct although this is a loan
 
06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
program so it wouldn't be a grant
 
06:15:53.030 --> 06:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
program so if if you were granted money
 
06:15:54.628 --> 06:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
through another program let's say the
 
06:15:58.430 --> 06:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
Essa or arp uh funds then that money
 
06:16:00.750 --> 06:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible because that was
 
06:16:02.990 --> 06:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
money given to the school district so
 
06:16:05.548 --> 06:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
that would be ineligible but money from
 
06:16:07.910 --> 06:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
a loan program would be eligible because
 
06:16:09.670 --> 06:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
it would just be like a a school
 
06:16:11.910 --> 06:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
district going to their own private bank
 
06:16:14.830 --> 06:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
and getting uh funds for their project
 
06:16:17.510 --> 06:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
too um so this money in my view this
 
06:16:19.190 --> 06:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
money would be eligible for school
 
06:16:20.708 --> 06:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
building Aid at least the law doesn't
 
06:16:23.350 --> 06:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
currently prohibit um any kind of Loan
 
06:16:26.230 --> 06:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
program money being eligible for
 
06:16:28.548 --> 06:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
building Aid um building Aid is never
 
06:16:30.990 --> 06:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for interest payments anyway
 
06:16:32.590 --> 06:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
it's really just the principal amount so
 
06:16:33.830 --> 06:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really even matter that this
 
06:16:36.670 --> 06:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
is interest free or not interest
 
06:16:38.948 --> 06:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
free I have one other question for the
 
06:16:40.590 --> 06:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
committee and then I'll let now the
 
06:16:41.830 --> 06:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
school building
 
06:16:44.990 --> 06:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
authority which is tasked with bonding
 
06:16:46.468 --> 06:16:46.478 align:start position:0%
and all
 
06:16:49.750 --> 06:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
that um is there any involvement with a
 
06:16:53.230 --> 06:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
school building authority with this fund
 
06:16:55.590 --> 06:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
and the allocation X number of dollars
 
06:16:58.230 --> 06:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
for um I don't I don't see that listed
 
06:17:01.030 --> 06:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere this doesn't look like this is
 
06:17:03.110 --> 06:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
um compl this is not really linked to
 
06:17:06.868 --> 06:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
building Aid now this is a um it gives
 
06:17:10.150 --> 06:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
an example that you could use you could
 
06:17:13.430 --> 06:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
plan a project and then it doesn't
 
06:17:15.708 --> 06:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
Prelude you from applying for building
 
06:17:19.708 --> 06:17:19.718 align:start position:0%
aid but this this state revolving fund
 
06:17:22.990 --> 06:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
um also would include it says in here
 
06:17:25.150 --> 06:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
that it would include any any projects
 
06:17:27.030 --> 06:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
to help with that Planning and
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
Development it's a way to help school
 
06:17:30.628 --> 06:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
districts that can't come up with their
 
06:17:33.990 --> 06:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
Planning and Development costs to put
 
06:17:37.548 --> 06:17:37.558 align:start position:0%
together a good plan prior to either
 
06:17:39.030 --> 06:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
moving forward with their plan on their
 
06:17:41.708 --> 06:17:41.718 align:start position:0%
own local dollars or applying to school
 
06:17:41.718 --> 06:17:43.628 align:start position:0%
own local dollars or applying to school
building

06:17:43.628 --> 06:17:43.638 align:start position:0%
building
 
06:17:46.990 --> 06:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
Aid are there further questions
 
06:17:49.230 --> 06:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
yesah thank you and thank you for taking
 
06:17:52.868 --> 06:17:52.878 align:start position:0%
my question um I noticed uh it seems
 
06:17:55.230 --> 06:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
like people are talking definitely
 
06:17:57.430 --> 06:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
emphasizing Charter School part of it
 
06:17:59.868 --> 06:17:59.878 align:start position:0%
was Charter Schools not involved in this
 
06:18:03.350 --> 06:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
before uh and are now being implemented
 
06:18:05.708 --> 06:18:05.718 align:start position:0%
with the building Aid is that is that my
 
06:18:07.510 --> 06:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
understanding there is another bill I am
 
06:18:09.510 --> 06:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
aware that there's another bill to um
 
06:18:11.230 --> 06:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
include them in school building Aid
 
06:18:12.830 --> 06:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
right now charter schools are not
 
06:18:15.990 --> 06:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for school building Aid uh and
 
06:18:18.510 --> 06:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
so right now Charter Schools can't apply
 
06:18:21.948 --> 06:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
for building aid but if that bill passes
 
06:18:23.510 --> 06:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
then they would be eligible for build
 
06:18:25.390 --> 06:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
aid but to keep in mind this isn't
 
06:18:27.070 --> 06:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
specific to Charter Schools it would be
 
06:18:28.628 --> 06:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
for all school districts and there are a
 
06:18:31.110 --> 06:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
lot of um school districts that struggle
 
06:18:32.590 --> 06:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
to put together a building aid
 
06:18:34.510 --> 06:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
application because it takes a lot of
 
06:18:36.548 --> 06:18:36.558 align:start position:0%
planning money that they don't have
 
06:18:36.558 --> 06:18:38.510 align:start position:0%
planning money that they don't have
access

06:18:38.510 --> 06:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
access
 
06:18:42.070 --> 06:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
to yes you so what happens to this bill
 
06:18:45.030 --> 06:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
if the if the other one doesn't pass or
 
06:18:47.270 --> 06:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
vice versa so if the other one doesn't
 
06:18:49.310 --> 06:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
so let's say this bill passes but the
 
06:18:51.628 --> 06:18:51.638 align:start position:0%
other one passes that specifically
 
06:18:53.430 --> 06:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
includes charter schools in school
 
06:18:55.910 --> 06:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
building Aid Public School District
 
06:18:57.948 --> 06:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
could still use the state revolving fund
 
06:18:59.430 --> 06:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
the way it's written it's just for all
 
06:19:02.628 --> 06:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
public schools um to use this fund and I
 
06:19:04.468 --> 06:19:04.478 align:start position:0%
I believe that representative Mooney
 
06:19:08.390 --> 06:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
included that in our testimony um but if
 
06:19:10.670 --> 06:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
the other one passes then obviously
 
06:19:12.270 --> 06:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools could tap into the state
 
06:19:13.830 --> 06:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
revolving fund as
 
06:19:17.310 --> 06:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
well and actually I I'm sorry I I think
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
I did misspeak or mislead anyway I keep
 
06:19:24.510 --> 06:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
in mind that this is not only for but
 
06:19:26.868 --> 06:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
building Aid regardless if that bill
 
06:19:28.628 --> 06:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
passes Charter Schools could still use
 
06:19:31.030 --> 06:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
the state revolving fund I I I don't
 
06:19:32.830 --> 06:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
think I clearly said that before so
 
06:19:34.510 --> 06:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools could still use this
 
06:19:35.628 --> 06:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
even if they're not eligible for
 
06:19:36.868 --> 06:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
building Aid at least the way it's
 
06:19:40.070 --> 06:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
written because this is not does not
 
06:19:43.510 --> 06:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
require schools to use this money to
 
06:19:45.750 --> 06:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
apply for building
 
06:19:48.750 --> 06:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
Aid you have a follow question
 
06:19:54.750 --> 06:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
yes um so for the the uh ranked uh the
 
06:19:59.548 --> 06:19:59.558 align:start position:0%
ranking uh based on your uh based on the
 
06:20:01.708 --> 06:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
applications about the conditions of the
 
06:20:04.830 --> 06:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
program how does that what criteria do
 
06:20:07.270 --> 06:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
you use for the ranking are are all
 
06:20:09.788 --> 06:20:09.798 align:start position:0%
schools and and Charter Schools
 
06:20:12.510 --> 06:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
considered um let's say they they have a
 
06:20:14.150 --> 06:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
school that's a hundred years old and
 
06:20:16.310 --> 06:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
they need you know the they have Steam
 
06:20:18.990 --> 06:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
Heat so there's no ventilation um and
 
06:20:21.510 --> 06:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're a public Elementary School uh
 
06:20:25.230 --> 06:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
how are they ranked against for example
 
06:20:26.788 --> 06:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
char schol school that wants to open in
 
06:20:29.788 --> 06:20:29.798 align:start position:0%
a strip mall that uh the strip mall has
 
06:20:31.430 --> 06:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh poor ventilation as well I mean how
 
06:20:32.628 --> 06:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
do you how do you make those
 
06:20:35.948 --> 06:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
determinations is there any priority set
 
06:20:38.628 --> 06:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
um so if a public if a charter school
 
06:20:40.430 --> 06:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
was eligible Public Charter School was
 
06:20:42.310 --> 06:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
eligible for building Aid There's no
 
06:20:44.628 --> 06:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
distinction in the law that would judge
 
06:20:47.190 --> 06:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
them any differently than an elementary
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
school or not but but to answer your
 
06:20:51.270 --> 06:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
question that franking criteria is based
 
06:20:53.590 --> 06:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
on a lot of things but one of them is um
 
06:20:56.510 --> 06:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
safety issues um
 
06:20:59.190 --> 06:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
condition assessment of the school
 
06:21:01.788 --> 06:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
overcrowding um Ada correcting Ada
 
06:21:04.788 --> 06:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
issues any kind of life safety issues um
 
06:21:08.670 --> 06:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
also included in there there are um
 
06:21:10.628 --> 06:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
percent eligible for free and reduced
 
06:21:13.628 --> 06:21:13.638 align:start position:0%
lunch um costs so there are some things
 
06:21:16.628 --> 06:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
that um if public charger schools become
 
06:21:18.628 --> 06:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
eligible for Aid that that might be a
 
06:21:21.830 --> 06:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more difficult to calculate
 
06:21:24.628 --> 06:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
um yeah there's some other criteria as
 
06:21:27.628 --> 06:21:27.638 align:start position:0%
well further questions yes
 
06:21:27.638 --> 06:21:28.750 align:start position:0%
well further questions yes
representative

06:21:28.750 --> 06:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:21:31.628 --> 06:21:31.638 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:21:34.070 --> 06:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh Amy for taking my question I I just
 
06:21:36.750 --> 06:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I understand
 
06:21:39.590 --> 06:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
what's happening here so this bill
 
06:21:43.190 --> 06:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
establishes the program and a revolving
 
06:21:47.190 --> 06:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund but it doesn't appropriate any
 
06:21:50.030 --> 06:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
money for it nor does it give us any
 
06:21:52.430 --> 06:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
indication of where the money might be
 
06:21:56.190 --> 06:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
coming from or how much money
 
06:21:58.030 --> 06:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
might be needed in that fund am I
 
06:21:59.830 --> 06:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
correct in that correct that's a very
 
06:22:02.430 --> 06:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
very good point um in here at the bottom
 
06:22:06.070 --> 06:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
it talks about um establishing a fund so
 
06:22:07.910 --> 06:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
that fund would need to be established
 
06:22:10.190 --> 06:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
that there's no funding source that I'm
 
06:22:12.910 --> 06:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
aware of nor is there any indication
 
06:22:14.590 --> 06:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
again that I'm aware of of how much
 
06:22:16.350 --> 06:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
money the legislature wants to put in
 
06:22:18.788 --> 06:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
there whether it be enough to cover four
 
06:22:21.150 --> 06:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
four Planning and Development projects
 
06:22:26.270 --> 06:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
or 10 or 50 and and a follow to that Mr
 
06:22:29.708 --> 06:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
chair if you're okay with that and so do
 
06:22:32.468 --> 06:22:32.478 align:start position:0%
you have an understanding of how much I
 
06:22:33.948 --> 06:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
mean it says up to
 
06:22:37.548 --> 06:22:37.558 align:start position:0%
$100,000 loan per and that it's Net Zero
 
06:22:40.468 --> 06:22:40.478 align:start position:0%
because I would assume the charter or
 
06:22:43.110 --> 06:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
the district is meant to pay it back to
 
06:22:46.788 --> 06:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
the fund but do you have any sense of
 
06:22:50.590 --> 06:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
knowing what kinds of building needs and
 
06:22:54.150 --> 06:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
projects are out there what kind of
 
06:22:56.270 --> 06:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
startup money would be need needed for
 
06:22:58.670 --> 06:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
this to happen uh that's very good
 
06:23:01.070 --> 06:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
question it's hard to say how how many
 
06:23:03.548 --> 06:23:03.558 align:start position:0%
schools might take advantage of that but
 
06:23:06.670 --> 06:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
just to give you an example um building
 
06:23:10.868 --> 06:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
Aid um occurs in a bium cycle those um
 
06:23:12.628 --> 06:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
they call them letters of intent school
 
06:23:14.910 --> 06:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
districts have to let um the Department
 
06:23:16.190 --> 06:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
of Education know that they're
 
06:23:18.510 --> 06:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
interested in applying for building Aid
 
06:23:19.708 --> 06:23:19.718 align:start position:0%
uh again charter schools are not
 
06:23:21.708 --> 06:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
currently eligible but of the other
 
06:23:24.548 --> 06:23:24.558 align:start position:0%
Public Schools we just received 28
 
06:23:27.628 --> 06:23:27.638 align:start position:0%
applications totaling
 
06:23:30.548 --> 06:23:30.558 align:start position:0%
$650 Million worth of projects over the
 
06:23:32.948 --> 06:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
next two years the building Aid portion
 
06:23:37.670 --> 06:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
of that is about 250 million um but keep
 
06:23:40.510 --> 06:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
in mind that's 28 projects so to more to
 
06:23:43.510 --> 06:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
answer your question it was 28 projects
 
06:23:45.390 --> 06:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
over the course of two years it's 14
 
06:23:48.350 --> 06:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
projects a year if they were all seeking
 
06:23:52.070 --> 06:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
$100,000 then here you have $1.4 million
 
06:23:54.548 --> 06:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
um but that's not to that's not to say
 
06:23:57.390 --> 06:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
that all those schol would need to find
 
06:23:59.590 --> 06:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
there are many schools that would not
 
06:24:02.030 --> 06:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
that would that don't need access to
 
06:24:03.948 --> 06:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
this money and I imagine there' be some
 
06:24:05.868 --> 06:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
kind of there's some rul Mak Authority
 
06:24:07.708 --> 06:24:07.718 align:start position:0%
in here that perhaps that rul making
 
06:24:10.070 --> 06:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
Authority would have to adjust based on
 
06:24:12.510 --> 06:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
how much the legislature the legislature
 
06:24:14.310 --> 06:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
gives 1.4 million then the rules might
 
06:24:16.468 --> 06:24:16.478 align:start position:0%
not have to establish where that money
 
06:24:19.070 --> 06:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
goes but if that funding is a lot less
 
06:24:21.110 --> 06:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
then those rules might need to address
 
06:24:23.670 --> 06:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
issues thank you further questions
 
06:24:26.868 --> 06:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
representative Porter
 
06:24:28.190 --> 06:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:24:31.990 --> 06:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I don't know much
 
06:24:34.868 --> 06:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
about the uh physical condition of the
 
06:24:36.990 --> 06:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
charter schools that we have in the
 
06:24:41.070 --> 06:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
state now but I don't are there many
 
06:24:42.788 --> 06:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
that have their own buildings that would
 
06:24:46.390 --> 06:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
be wanting building Aid or you know like
 
06:24:48.030 --> 06:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
what percentage of our Charter Schools
 
06:24:52.948 --> 06:24:52.958 align:start position:0%
do you think might need this a
 
06:24:55.548 --> 06:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
and that'll be the end of my question
 
06:24:57.150 --> 06:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that's also a good question
 
06:24:58.590 --> 06:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have that data in
 
06:25:00.910 --> 06:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
front of me I do have that in the office
 
06:25:03.310 --> 06:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
um but right now a lot majority of our
 
06:25:06.110 --> 06:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools lease um but at the same
 
06:25:07.830 --> 06:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
time the longer a charter school is
 
06:25:09.590 --> 06:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
established they may be looking we
 
06:25:11.070 --> 06:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
certainly have charter schools that do
 
06:25:13.590 --> 06:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
own their own buildings uh and keep in
 
06:25:15.390 --> 06:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
mind there's a a program that dovet
 
06:25:17.910 --> 06:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
Tales building Aid called lease Aid um
 
06:25:20.270 --> 06:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's available for charter schools and
 
06:25:22.190 --> 06:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much that drives a
 
06:25:24.070 --> 06:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
charter to school to say we're going to
 
06:25:25.708 --> 06:25:25.718 align:start position:0%
continue to lease because we have access
 
06:25:27.948 --> 06:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
to lease a versus we're thinking about
 
06:25:29.628 --> 06:25:29.638 align:start position:0%
building and if we build then we're long
 
06:25:31.990 --> 06:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
going to have lease Aid I don't know the
 
06:25:34.390 --> 06:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
answers to those questions but um what I
 
06:25:36.150 --> 06:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
could provide the committee if You' like
 
06:25:38.150 --> 06:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
is um a list of how many Charter Schools
 
06:25:39.590 --> 06:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
own their own buildings and how many
 
06:25:42.150 --> 06:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
schools need have
 
06:25:45.390 --> 06:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
data representative Porter uh I see Matt
 
06:25:47.948 --> 06:25:47.958 align:start position:0%
Southerton here director of the charter
 
06:25:50.070 --> 06:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
school group maybe he might have that
 
06:25:52.830 --> 06:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
answer for you when he speaks further
 
06:25:55.868 --> 06:25:55.878 align:start position:0%

Matton choking ha polities uh I've
 
06:26:35.990 --> 06:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
worked with New Hampshire charter
 
06:26:39.548 --> 06:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
schools for about 20 years um I wanted
 
06:26:41.468 --> 06:26:41.478 align:start position:0%
to make my comments brief because I know
 
06:26:43.230 --> 06:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
that you've all been here for a long
 
06:26:43.240 --> 06:26:44.070 align:start position:0%
that you've all been here for a long
time

06:26:44.070 --> 06:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:26:46.270 --> 06:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
today uh when I saw this bill I was
 
06:26:47.990 --> 06:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
really excited because I know that we
 
06:26:50.590 --> 06:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
have a number of uh small school
 
06:26:52.390 --> 06:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
districts and a number of small charter
 
06:26:55.468 --> 06:26:55.478 align:start position:0%
schools that could uh really use prr
 
06:26:57.270 --> 06:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
like this I think it would be good
 
06:27:00.910 --> 06:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
public policy uh when I read this
 
06:27:04.868 --> 06:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
bill it struck me as a tool that
 
06:27:07.830 --> 06:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
districts and Charter Schools could use
 
06:27:09.910 --> 06:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
and a program that the department could
 
06:27:11.510 --> 06:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
use to
 
06:27:14.310 --> 06:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
facilitate assisting charter schools and
 
06:27:18.190 --> 06:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
districts to access the experts that
 
06:27:22.750 --> 06:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
they need to help to help them
 
06:27:24.670 --> 06:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
understand whether a project is good or
 
06:27:27.390 --> 06:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
not for them right uh these small
 
06:27:29.468 --> 06:27:29.478 align:start position:0%
schools and these districts just frankly
 
06:27:32.910 --> 06:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
do not have the expertise or the funding
 
06:27:37.310 --> 06:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
necessary to um be able to assess these
 
06:27:43.548 --> 06:27:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:46.190 --> 06:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
are whether it makes sense for them
 
06:27:48.628 --> 06:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
right so I I am supportive of this
 
06:27:50.468 --> 06:27:50.478 align:start position:0%
project and uh we're supportive of this
 
06:27:51.990 --> 06:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
point and I'd be happy to take any
 
06:27:54.110 --> 06:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
questions I heard the one about how many
 
06:27:56.708 --> 06:27:56.718 align:start position:0%
charter schools um actually own their
 
06:27:59.350 --> 06:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
own building I believe it's four in New
 
06:28:01.150 --> 06:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that'd be SE Co Charter School

Matt

06:28:13.430 --> 06:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
Matt
 
06:28:15.868 --> 06:28:15.878 align:start position:0%
Southerton Matt do you have any idea
 
06:28:17.430 --> 06:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
what the condition of those four
 
06:28:19.708 --> 06:28:19.718 align:start position:0%
facilities look like bear middle and
 
06:28:23.150 --> 06:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
what they are uh they are in uh pretty
 
06:28:26.670 --> 06:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
good condition they um I don't think
 
06:28:28.350 --> 06:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
that at this time they'd actually take
 
06:28:30.468 --> 06:28:30.478 align:start position:0%
advantage of this program but I know
 
06:28:32.590 --> 06:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
that a number of charter schools that
 
06:28:34.190 --> 06:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
that that are very interested I spoke
 
06:28:35.230 --> 06:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
with a number of Charter School
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
directors around the state I think that
 
06:28:39.070 --> 06:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
they're supportive of this bill and they
 
06:28:41.350 --> 06:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
would like to have been here however due
 
06:28:43.788 --> 06:28:43.798 align:start position:0%
to staffing issues they weren't able to
 
06:28:45.110 --> 06:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
attend this
 
06:28:48.150 --> 06:28:48.160 align:start position:0%

thank the committee for allowing me to
 
06:29:47.120 --> 06:29:48.750 align:start position:0%
thank the committee for allowing me to
speak

06:29:48.750 --> 06:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
speak
 
06:29:51.510 --> 06:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
um you know between the representative
 
06:29:52.868 --> 06:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
and between Miss Clark I think they've
 
06:29:55.190 --> 06:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
explained what the bill does I'll be
 
06:29:56.868 --> 06:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions on that I what
 
06:29:58.868 --> 06:29:58.878 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do is just briefly discuss
 
06:30:01.868 --> 06:30:01.878 align:start position:0%
the two parts of the bill uh that we in
 
06:30:03.590 --> 06:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
particular like we obviously support
 
06:30:07.590 --> 06:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
this this bill uh I think the way you
 
06:30:08.670 --> 06:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
know if you were to describe the
 
06:30:10.788 --> 06:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
building aid process uh I'll call it
 
06:30:10.798 --> 06:30:12.030 align:start position:0%
building aid process uh I'll call it
appropriately

06:30:12.030 --> 06:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
06:30:15.750 --> 06:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
arduous um it frequently requires exper
 
06:30:17.708 --> 06:30:17.718 align:start position:0%
uh expertise engineering construction
 
06:30:17.718 --> 06:30:18.628 align:start position:0%
uh expertise engineering construction
legal

06:30:18.628 --> 06:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
legal
 
06:30:21.628 --> 06:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
financing um the issue is that those are
 
06:30:24.830 --> 06:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
costs that I think a lot of uh districts
 
06:30:27.150 --> 06:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
not a lot of uh I think lower resource
 
06:30:29.270 --> 06:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
districts and most Charter Schools
 
06:30:29.280 --> 06:30:30.310 align:start position:0%
districts and most Charter Schools
cannot

06:30:30.310 --> 06:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
06:30:33.548 --> 06:30:33.558 align:start position:0%
afford the relevance of that is if you
 
06:30:37.350 --> 06:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
are involved in the application process
 
06:30:40.350 --> 06:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh for building Aid uh the ability to
 
06:30:41.750 --> 06:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
pay for expertise gives you a
 
06:30:44.628 --> 06:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
competitive advantage and what I like
 
06:30:48.548 --> 06:30:48.558 align:start position:0%
about this bill here is it it allows the
 
06:30:50.590 --> 06:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh previously mentioned the districts
 
06:30:51.788 --> 06:30:51.798 align:start position:0%
that don't have as much money and the
 
06:30:54.830 --> 06:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
charter schools to actually pay for
 
06:30:56.230 --> 06:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
expertise that allows them to fill out
 
06:30:58.548 --> 06:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
the application in a way that allows
 
06:31:00.948 --> 06:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
them to be competitive that's one part
 
06:31:04.150 --> 06:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
that we obviously like the other part
 
06:31:07.430 --> 06:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
that I that I like is I actually think
 
06:31:11.350 --> 06:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is is useful um in this case
 
06:31:12.830 --> 06:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking directly to the Charter
 
06:31:15.230 --> 06:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
School issue I believe it's useful to
 
06:31:19.868 --> 06:31:19.878 align:start position:0%
the Charter Schools um in a couple ways
 
06:31:23.388 --> 06:31:23.398 align:start position:0%
one say you're doing a project I know
 
06:31:25.468 --> 06:31:25.478 align:start position:0%
there's a building Aid bill
 
06:31:27.230 --> 06:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
out there obviously I hope you support
 
06:31:29.230 --> 06:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
that but let's just take that to the
 
06:31:31.990 --> 06:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
side for a second say you had a a
 
06:31:34.990 --> 06:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
project that just it wasn't um it wasn't
 
06:31:37.468 --> 06:31:37.478 align:start position:0%
appropriate for building a it was it was
 
06:31:38.708 --> 06:31:38.718 align:start position:0%
you know just a couple hundred thousand
 
06:31:41.388 --> 06:31:41.398 align:start position:0%
dollars uh maybe you know say you had a
 
06:31:43.628 --> 06:31:43.638 align:start position:0%
drainage issue or something like that
 
06:31:46.468 --> 06:31:46.478 align:start position:0%
you still need expertise and you're
 
06:31:49.388 --> 06:31:49.398 align:start position:0%
still GNA go out for private
 
06:31:51.430 --> 06:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
financing a lot of our Charter Schools
 
06:31:53.310 --> 06:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
would have a hard time accessing the
 
06:31:55.590 --> 06:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
expertise they need just to get private
 
06:31:57.708 --> 06:31:57.718 align:start position:0%
private financing so this bill if it was
 
06:32:00.310 --> 06:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
the pass I think it actually even allows
 
06:32:03.110 --> 06:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
charter schools to access that access
 
06:32:05.270 --> 06:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
the expertise that would allow them to
 
06:32:07.030 --> 06:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
access private
 
06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
financing um I was going to stop there
 
06:32:12.670 --> 06:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
um representative Tanner you asked a
 
06:32:13.788 --> 06:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
question that
 
06:32:16.070 --> 06:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
actually I would like to answer if I
 
06:32:19.788 --> 06:32:19.798 align:start position:0%
could if it turns out that the chart the
 
06:32:20.990 --> 06:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
charters are not made eligible for
 
06:32:22.910 --> 06:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
building Aid I think this bill would
 
06:32:25.788 --> 06:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
still actually be useful um um right now
 
06:32:27.350 --> 06:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
what they have to do is they have to get
 
06:32:30.150 --> 06:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
their own private financing so say a
 
06:32:31.708 --> 06:32:31.718 align:start position:0%
which is obviously very difficult but
 
06:32:33.670 --> 06:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
say a Char school was trying to do a
 
06:32:33.680 --> 06:32:34.590 align:start position:0%
say a Char school was trying to do a
major

06:32:34.590 --> 06:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
major
 
06:32:36.708 --> 06:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
expansion they're still going to need
 
06:32:39.670 --> 06:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
access to that expertise to to go get
 
06:32:41.830 --> 06:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
the private financing so this would
 
06:32:43.948 --> 06:32:43.958 align:start position:0%
actually still be helpful even if the
 
06:32:46.510 --> 06:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
school B school um building Aid bill was
 
06:32:48.270 --> 06:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
not to pass again I hope it does but if
 
06:32:50.990 --> 06:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't this would still be
 
06:32:53.230 --> 06:32:53.240 align:start position:0%
helpful um again I appreciate your
 
06:32:54.910 --> 06:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
consideration and I'm happy any
 
06:32:57.868 --> 06:32:57.878 align:start position:0%
questions I can thank you very much yes
 
06:32:57.878 --> 06:33:00.430 align:start position:0%
questions I can thank you very much yes
represent

06:33:00.430 --> 06:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
Nelson forgive this ignorant question
 
06:33:07.310 --> 06:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
here but is this money purely for ones
 
06:33:11.990 --> 06:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
that are owned or ones that are rented
 
06:33:14.948 --> 06:33:14.958 align:start position:0%
rent lease of space do they get to use
 
06:33:16.750 --> 06:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
the money to do something around a
 
06:33:17.990 --> 06:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
building their
 
06:33:20.910 --> 06:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
leasing so it I don't think the bill
 
06:33:25.948 --> 06:33:25.958 align:start position:0%
speaks to it um not obvious to me why
 
06:33:27.270 --> 06:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
if you were leasing a building I would
 
06:33:29.070 --> 06:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
actually think you'd want the the owner
 
06:33:32.270 --> 06:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
to actually do that renovation um
 
06:33:34.030 --> 06:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
because you you don't own it after that
 
06:33:36.310 --> 06:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
right um but I I don't believe the bill
 
06:33:38.030 --> 06:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
speaks to it that you you ask a good
 
06:33:40.510 --> 06:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
question there my brain as we're
 
06:33:41.750 --> 06:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about this was I was thinking
 
06:33:44.270 --> 06:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
of owner
 
06:33:46.948 --> 06:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
situations further
 
06:33:49.270 --> 06:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any hands up thank
 
06:33:52.070 --> 06:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
you very much all right thank you yep
 
06:33:52.080 --> 06:33:53.468 align:start position:0%
you very much all right thank you yep
that's

06:33:53.468 --> 06:33:53.478 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:33:56.948 --> 06:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
it that's it on uh this bill
 
06:34:00.430 --> 06:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
1685 uh we'll close the hearing and that
 
06:34:11.070 --> 06:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:11.080 --> 06:34:14.430 align:start position:0%
 
today

06:34:14.430 --> 06:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:14.440 --> 06:34:17.388 align:start position:0%
 
bu

06:34:17.388 --> 06:34:17.398 align:start position:0%
bu
 
06:34:20.590 --> 06:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
you years if you pull out you got pay it
 
06:34:23.468 --> 06:34:23.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:26.150 --> 06:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
theate so what happens here if you get
 
06:34:28.350 --> 06:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
this yeah that's a tough deal so they're
 
06:34:29.868 --> 06:34:29.878 align:start position:0%
not going to go for the building a
 
06:34:32.310 --> 06:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
because they they might pull out 10
 
06:34:53.388 --> 06:34:53.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:53.398 --> 06:34:56.398 align:start position:0%
 
have
